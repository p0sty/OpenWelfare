<p>If the customer (this refers to foster child in the case of FST) returns to Australia before the end of the portability period and entitlement has continued throughout the period of absence, a new card does not need to be issued.</p>

<p>For FST, only the foster child’s temporary absence is subject to portability requirements. There is no limitation on the temporary absence of the foster carer.</p>

Test days are 20 March, 20 June, 20 September and 20 December.</p>

<p>In many cases customers do not need to advise the agency if they are leaving Australia temporarily, or have returned from a temporary absence.</p>

<p>However, there are particular situations where customers should advise of a departure prior to leaving Australia or advise they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p>In most cases, customers can notify of their departure from Australia via the <a href="../self-service/133-04150030-01.html">Travelling outside of Australia service</a> within their <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Centrelink online account.
