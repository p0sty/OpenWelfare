<p>Jane is an Australian citizen who travels overseas. While overseas, Jane enters into a relationship with Rodney and gives birth to a child as a result of that relationship. Jane lives overseas with Rodney (partner) and their child for 4 years before separating from Rodney and returning to Australia, having been offered a job in Australia.</p>

<p>Rodney is residing in a country that has a reciprocal arrangement with Australia, which allows Jane to seek maintenance from Rodney. Jane decides not to pursue this. Jane also decides not to claim FTB straight away after returning to Australia, as the anticipated income is too high and Jane may not be eligible for a payment.</p>

<p>However, Jane's new employment contract is subsequently withdrawn and Jane then claims FTB 10 weeks after returning to Australia. As Jane has been able to apply for child support since returning to Australia, Jane's DMA period starts on the day Jane arrived in Australia. Jane has 3 weeks remaining to take reasonable action to obtain maintenance, without the rate being reduced to the base rate of FTB Part A.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to manually providing Lynne-Michelle with a DMA period from the date Lynne-Michelle becomes eligible for FTB Part A. This is because even though Lynne-Michelle could have applied for child support when arriving in Australia, Lynne-Michelle may not have known to apply (or the consequences of not applying).</p>

<p>The Service Officer determines that Lynne-Michelle could not have reasonably been aware of the need to take maintenance action, and refers the case for PDE to be manually coded from the date Lynne-Michelle became entitled to FTB Part A.</p>

<p>Megan (who is an Australian citizen), returns to Australia to raise the child. As Russia is a non-reciprocal country, Megan was not required to pursue maintenance. (Megan was exempt from the MAT)</p>

<p>Six months later, Robert who has dual citizenship, decides to move to Australia. Robert advises Megan about moving to Australia on January 15.</p>
