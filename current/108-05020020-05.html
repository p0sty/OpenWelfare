<p><strong>Do leave payments count as lump sums?</strong></p>

<p><strong>When employment is ongoing</strong></p>

<p>The only <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010100-01.html">leave payments</a> treated as lump sums are those in respect of accrued entitlements paid at the same time as the employee is at work also earning wages (often referred to as leave paid out). Leave payments that are paid out are assessed as income for a period of up to 52 weeks.</p>

<p>Normal leave payments, that is, when an ongoing employee is paid for a recognised absence, counts as ongoing employment income.</p>

<p><strong>When employment is terminated</strong></p>

<p>Payments in respect of leave, made on or after termination, also not treated as lump sums&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Are lump sums keyed in the same way for all benefits and pensions?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Remunerative Lump Sums</strong></p>

<p>Remunerative lump sum amounts are apportioned over a period up to 52 weeks. At the end of the assessment period the system will automatically cease assessing the income.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment when source ceases</strong></p>

<p>The sum is assessed from the entitlement period start in which it is paid over a period up to 52 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong> An annual bonus of $1,500 paid on 3 January 2021 for 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. This $1,500 is coded on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen with event date 03 Jan 2021 with frequency '<strong>LOP</strong>' and a pay period of 01 Jan 2020 to 31 Dec 2020.</p>

<p>The income stops being assessed after 52 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Remunerative Lump Sums</strong></p>

<p>Non-remunerative lump sum amounts are apportioned over a period of 52 weeks. At the end of the assessment period the income will be ceased.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment when source ceases</strong></p>

<p>The sum is assessed from the date received over a period of 52 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong> A non-exempt state government payment of $1,500 is paid on 3 January 2021 for 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. This is coded on the <strong>OIN</strong> screen with event date 3 January 2021 with frequency '<strong>ANN</strong>'. This will then be assessed for a period of 52 weeks from 3 January 2021.</p></td>

<p><strong>Why are profits from conventional life insurance policies included in the social security Income Test?</strong></p>

<p>While the main purpose of conventional life insurance policies is to provide death cover, some policies include an investment element, which may pay bonuses to the investor. A person who invests in such a life insurance policy is seen as deriving income from a profit-making transaction.</p>

<p>To ignore the income from life insurance policies for Income Test purposes would be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
inequitable compared with the treatment of other products, and</li>
		<li>
inconsistent with the intention of the Social Security Act to assess income from all sources, with very limited exemptions. The Income Test is used to target income support to people at times of financial need while ensuring the social security safety net remains sustainable for Australian taxpayers</li>		</ul></td>

<p><strong>What is the current treatment of a conventional life insurance policy under the social security Means Tests (that is, under the Income Test and Assets Test)?</strong></p>

<p>During the term of the policy&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
bonuses are not assessed as income until they are received (paid out) by the policy holder</li>
		<li>
The surrender value of the policy is assessed as an asset unless&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the person became the owner of the policy after 1 July 2019, AND</li>
			<li>
the person became the owner of the policy after the person reached pension age, AND</li>
			<li>
the sum of the amounts paid for the policy in any 12 month period exceeds 15% of the maximum death benefit that would be payable if the person died on the day of assessment</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>In this situation, the value of the life insurance policy is the higher of&#58;</p>
			<ul>			<li>
the surrender value of the policy, OR</li>
			<li>
the sum of the amounts paid to purchase the policy, less any commuted amounts</li>		</ul>
		<ul>		<li>
the asset value of the policy is reduced by the amount of the encumbrance if the customer borrows against the policy</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Upon withdrawal from a policy</strong> - whether by surrender or the policy reaching the maturity date first specified for the policy (if a policy has matured but none or only part of the maturity entitlement is withdrawn, at the point of maturity the treatment is the same as if a full withdrawal had been made - this is because income is assessable when a person first has legal entitlement to it)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the difference between the surrender/maturity value and the sum of the purchase price (if any) and the premiums paid by the investor over the life of the product is held as income over 12 months (under the Income Test)</li>
		<li>
the Assets Test treatment depends on what is done with the money. For example, if it is used to purchase a motor vehicle, the value of the motor vehicle will be assessed as an asset of the person. If is it used to pay off a mortgage on the principal home, it will not be assessed because the principal home is an exempt asset. If it is placed in a financial investment it will be assessed as a financial asset, and the interest it earns will be treated under the Income Test deeming rules</li>
		<li>
the precise effect of the withdrawal, and the use to which the money is put, depends on the circumstances of the individual. As well, the withdrawal may result in a person's assessment changing from the Assets Test to the Income Test and vice versa</li>
		<li>
the balance remaining with the insurance company is treated in the same way as any other financial asset and is assessable under the Income Test deeming rules</li>		</ul></td>

<p><strong>When did the Income Test assessment of conventional life insurance policies change?</strong></p>

<p>Prior to 21 July 1997, bonuses on conventional life insurance policies were not assessed as income. After 21 July 1997 the income testing of policies at surrender or maturity changed, as a result of a clarification of policy to ensure there was no misinterpretation of the Social Security Act.</p></td>

<p><strong>Is a conventional life insurance policy deemed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>No</strong>. During its life, a conventional life insurance policy is not assessed as a financial investment under the Income Test deeming rules (unlike pure investment policies, which are assessed this way). Amounts withdrawn from a conventional life insurance policy reinvested in a financial investment would be assessed under the Income Test deeming rules.</p></td>

<p><strong>Are there any exceptions to the current treatment, that is, have any policies ever been deemed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>. A small number of insurance products, which were once assessed under the Income Test deeming rules, are now regarded as conventional life insurance policies.</p>

<p>For each of these policies (see below), the only bonuses now subject to the Income Test treatment are those bonuses accumulated from the date the policy was no longer assessed as a financial investment.</p>

<p><strong>How is a traded policy assessed - for the seller? - for the purchaser?</strong></p>

<p>For social security Means Test purposes, a life-assigned policy retains its status as a conventional life insurance policy even when sold or purchased, for example on the secondary life insurance policy exchange. This means the Income Test and Assets Test treatment of such a policy in the hands of the purchaser follows the same principles as if the policy was in the hands of the original owner.</p>

<p><strong>In the hands of the person selling the policy</strong></p>

<p>The proceeds from the sale will be assessed under the Income Test in exactly the same way as the amount received upon surrender or upon maturity. If the full value is not received, the Assets Test deprivation assessment outlined in the previous answer applies.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The original owner buys an endowment insurance policy having a sum insured of $10,000 and pays premiums totalling $7,000. There is no initial purchase price.</p>

<p>After accumulating bonuses to the value of $4,000, the policy is sold for $13,000.</p>

<p>The income assessed for the original owner is $6,000, calculated as follows&#58; the sale price of $13,000 minus $7,000, which is the sum of the purchase price ($0) and the value of the premiums paid ($7,000).</p>

<p><strong>In the hands of the purchaser</strong></p>

<p>The income assessable upon surrender or maturity is the difference between the surrender/maturity value and the sum of the purchase price paid by the purchaser and any premiums paid by the purchaser.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>The purchaser of the policy in the above example continues to meet the premium payments, paying a total of $3,000 in premiums. The policy accumulates further bonuses and matures, with a maturity value of $20,000.</p>

<p>The income assessed for the purchaser upon maturity is $4,000&#58; the maturity value of $20,000 minus $16,000, which is the sum of the purchase price ($13,000 plus the value of premiums paid since the policy changed hands $3,000).</p></td>

<p><strong>What happens when a partial withdrawal is made during the term of the policy?</strong></p>

<p>The assessment of partial withdrawals can be complex. Only the profit (investment earnings component) of the withdrawal is assessed as income over 12 months.</p>

<p>For a partial withdrawal, the amount is reduced proportionally.</p>

<p><strong>Profit</strong> multiplied by the <strong>amount of withdrawal</strong> divided by <strong>value of investment at withdrawal</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A customer withdraws $20,000 from a policy with a surrender/maturity value of $60,000 and a profit component of $30,000.</p>

<p>To calculate the amount of income to be assessed for social security purposes&#58;</p>

<p>$30,000 x $20,000/$60,000 = $10,000 to be assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> subsequent withdrawals will be assessed similarly.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>After the first withdrawal, the above policy has a surrender/maturity value of $40,000 and a profit component of $20,000 (the original component minus the amount assessed as income).</p>

<p>The customer withdraws a further $20,000.</p>

<p>To calculate the amount of income to be assessed for social security purposes&#58;</p>

<p>$20,000 x $20,000/$40,000 = $10,000 to be assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a policy has matured but is not fully withdrawn, at the point of maturity the treatment is the same as if a full withdrawal has been made. As well, the amount remaining with the insurance company is treated as any other financial asset and deemed accordingly.</p></td>

<p><strong>How is a policy assessed when ownership is gifted to another?</strong></p>

<p><strong>For the person making the gift</strong>, the asset value, less the allowable gifting amount, will be assessed as a deprived asset and deemed under the Means Test for 5 years from the date of disposal.</p>

<p><strong>For the person receiving the gift</strong>, the income assessable upon surrender or maturity will be the difference between the surrender/ maturity value and the sum of the surrender value at time of receipt of the gift plus any premiums paid by the recipient of the gift.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the precise effect of the gifting depends on the circumstances of the individual. 'Gifting' may result in a person's assessment changing from the Assets Test to the Income Test and vice versa.</p></td>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>.

<p><strong>Yes</strong>. Bonuses received (paid to the policy holder) up to 12 months before a claim is made for social security income support are assessed as income. A person is taken to receive the bonus income for 12 months commencing the day on which the person becomes entitled to that bonus.</p></td>

<p><strong>How is a payment of an insurance death benefit assessed?</strong></p>

<p>Life insurance offices commit to paying a specified minimum benefit on the occurrence of particular events such as the death of the insured.</p>

<p>A death benefit is not assessed as income for the person nominated to receive the benefit.</p>

<p>Assets Test assessment will depend on how the money is used. For example, if it is used to pay out the mortgage on a principal home it becomes part of an exempt asset. If it is placed in a financial investment it will be assessed as a financial asset, and the interest it earns will be treated under the Income Test deeming rules.</p></td>
