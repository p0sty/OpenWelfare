		<li>
a Proof of Enrolment (POE) document, if different from both the above dates</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a customer indicates a course end date before all of the above, code the earliest date of those above. Students enrolled in an accelerated course program, will have a different Inst course end date from their student end date. If the date is not available from any of these sources, use the date advised by the customer. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance is paid based on the duration of the course dates coded on the <strong>EDC</strong> screen.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to use the course end date from the current academic year as an estimate for future years. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; any date within 14 days before or after this estimated date will be accepted for QOL/QMA purposes.</p>

<p>Do not code the <strong>Inst Course End Date</strong> as 31 December unless classes actually finish on that date. If using 31 December, record a <strong>DOC</strong> confirming classes finished on that date.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTUDY PES customer studying a short course</strong></p>

<p>For ABSTUDY and PES purposes, a 'short course' is a course where the normal minimum duration for a full-time student to complete the course is not more than 30 weeks. This period includes any holidays and vacations. Customers completing a short course are only entitled to be paid for the duration of the course. This includes customers who are studying a short course under a part time or concessional study load, and complete their study after 15 September. These customers are only entitled to be paid to their course end date, not until 31 December.</p>

<p>To prevent the system from paying to 31 December the end dates on the <strong>EDC</strong> screen must be offset by coding the institution end date 1 date later than the student end date.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary students</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Inst Course End Date</strong> for full-time secondary students, who do not intend to re-enrol at the next available opportunity, is deemed to be the last day of the last term in the year as set by the relevant State/Territory education department.</p>

<p>End date for year 12 students should be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the last date the school considered the student enrolled, or</li>
		<li>
the date of the last exam, if this is earlier than the date the school considered the student to be no longer enrolled</li>		</ul>
