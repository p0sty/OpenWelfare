<p>A referral to a social worker is mandatory for all claimants aged under 18 regardless of the claim outcome. Referral to social work must be made before granting the claim. Service Officers must place the claim on hold pending the outcome of the social work assessment.</p>

<p>The main reasons for social worker involvement in these cases is to make sure the young carer&#58;</p>

has the physical and emotional capacity to provide the level of care needed, and</li>

On receipt of the unsuccessful <strong>Fast Note</strong>, Service Officers must reject the claim FRC. <a href="../carers/009-03040120-03.html">See Rejecting a Carer Payment (CP) claim or Rejecting a Carer Allowance (CA) claim</a>.</p>

<p>If concerns are raised either by the carer themselves or another party, that adequate care is not being provided and the care receiver may be at risk, a referral to a social worker is needed. The Service Officer must refer to social work for a wellbeing review.</p>

<p>Examples of these situations include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
allegations of&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
family violence</li>
			<li>
elder abuse or neglect</li>
			<li>
financial abuse </li>		</ul>
		<li>
the care receiver says that they are not being cared for and the care receiver has concerns for their safety if the CP or CA is cancelled</li>
		</ul>
<p>All carer neglect tip off matters are referred to social work under the care receiver at risk category. For more details on carer neglect tip-off reviews, see <a href="../carers/009-08060120-03.html">Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) carer neglect tip-off reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The main reasons for social work involvement in these cases are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
to conduct a welfare check on the care receiver, assessing risk and providing support</li>
		<li>
to conduct a review on the actual care being provided and whether the carer is continuing to provide care in line with eligibility for CP/CA</li>
		<li>
to discuss safety planning with the care receiver, if the carer is no longer providing care and there is family violence or abuse present, and before the Service Officer cancels the carer’s CP/CA</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Care Receiver at Risk referrals must be made in the care receiver's record. Information contained in these referrals is often sensitive. Service Officers or social workers <strong>must not</strong> record any information provided or allegations made by the care receiver or third parties in the carer’s record to maintain their privacy and safety.</p>

<p><strong>Capacity to care assessments</strong></p>

<p>Concerns may be raised about a carer’s capacity to care if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in the course of processing a new claim, it is apparent on the carer’s record that the carer has physical or mental health conditions that may impact their ability to provide care. For example, the carer may be in receipt of DSP, have a reduced work capacity or have provided recent medical certificates</li>
		<li>
the carer or a third party may advise that the carer has been diagnosed with a medical condition subsequent to receiving CP/CA</li>
		</ul>
<p>For customers already in receipt of CP/CA, the Service Officer should attempt to contact the customer prior to referring to social work to discuss their changed circumstances. For example, a customer that has been diagnosed with a serious or terminal illness may voluntarily surrender their CP/CA if their circumstances have changed. If the customer wishes to remain in receipt of CP/CA and the service officer has concerns about capacity, advise the carer that a social worker will contact them and refer to a social worker. </p>

<p><strong>Multiple Carer situations</strong></p>

<p>Multiple carer situations involve two or more people claiming to care for each other. For example, a mother with a physical disability is claiming to care for an adult child with an intellectual disability while the adult child is claiming to care for their partner with a mental illness. In these situations it can be difficult for the service officer to determine which party is caring for whom and their capacity to do so. A social work assessment can assist in determining the care needs of and actual level of care provided by each party. </p>

<p><strong>Disputed Care situations</strong></p>

<p>Disputed care occurs when two or more customers claim to be caring for the same care receiver however information in the claim does not meet criteria for two carers to be granted. See <a href="../carers/009-04060000-01.html">Carer Payment (CP) for 2 or more carers in respect of the same care receiver</a></p>

<p>If there is a dispute in care, before referral to social work, Service Officers should follow the process in <a target="_blank" href="../carers/009-03050000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Resolving_dispu">Table 2 Change of care for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) customers</a> to try to resolve the dispute. If there are indications that Domestic and Family Violence are present or if the dispute cannot be resolved, a referral to social work is required. </p>

<p><strong>Other Complex Care Situations</strong></p>

<p>Other situations may be referred to social work for further assessment after an initial investigation has been undertaken by a Service Officer. These may include situations where the carer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
does not live with the care receiver and there is doubt that care is being provided </li>

<p>The purpose of the social work assessment is to&#58;</p>

assess if the young person has the physical, intellectual and emotional capacity to provide the care needed</li>

assess if the young person is actually providing the level of care needed to meet eligibility for the Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance</li>
		<li>
make sure both the young person and the care receiver are linked with appropriate support services</li>
		</ul>
<p>The social worker should contact both the carer and the care receiver to discuss the care provided and the young person’s capacity to provide the care. See Resources for more details to support the social workers conversation. This includes examples of caring activities.</p>

<p>It is part of the social workers role to assess if a carer meets the 25 hour rule criteria&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the young person is enrolled in school, the social worker should confirm with the school how many hours per week they are needed to attend school</li>
		<li>
Travel time must be taken into account when calculating the 25 hour rule</li>
		<li>
The social worker must include the method of transport when calculating the time taken to attend school</li>
		</ul>
<p>Young carers may have negotiated alternative timetables with their school to allow them to provide care at home during normal school hours. If this is the case, the social worker should&#58;</p>

<p>A social worker must review a young carer after they grant CP and/or CA carers aged 15 and under. They must do this within specific timeframes according to their age.</p>

<p>The purpose of reviewing young carers is primarily&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for a wellbeing check to assess support needs</li>
		<li>
to offer referrals, and</li>
		<li>
to make sure care criteria continue to be met for payment eligibility</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Review Cycle for young carers </strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Carers aged <strong>13 years and under</strong> at time of grant must be reviewed 3 months following grant and then at least every 6months</li>
		<li>
Carers aged <strong>14 or 15 years</strong> at the time of grant must be reviewed 6 months following grant and then at least every 12 months</li>
		<li>
Carers aged <strong>16 or 17 years</strong> at the time of grant can be reviewed 6 or 12 months following grant at the discretion of the assessing social worker. </li>
		<li>
The Program Coordination and Professional Practice team trigger the reviews by obtaining Customer Reference Numbers (CRNs) from the Carers Branch according to the above review cycle</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Review Steps</strong></p>

<p>The social worker must contact the young carer and the care receiver if appropriate. If the carer’s parent is not the care receiver, contact with the parent may also help the social work assessment. </p>

<p>Discuss how the young carer is coping with their caring responsibilities.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Are they managing a balance between caring, education, and their own health and wellbeing?</li>
		<li>
Does the young carer have adequate support in place to support their caring role, social and education needs?</li>
		<li>
Are further reviews needed? (outside the mandatory review cycle)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The social worker must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
record in a <strong>File Note</strong> a summary of the issues above and outcome of the review</li>
		<li>
record any sensitive information in SWIS case notes</li>
		<li>
make a recommendation that all information indicates that the carer <strong>is or is not</strong> continuing to meet the care requirements of Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance </li>
		<li>
email SW.PCPP to advise that the review for the carer is complete, or if the review was unable to be completed as the carer could not be contacted</li>

<p>If concerns are raised either by the care receiver themselves or a third party, that adequate care is not being provided and the care receiver may be at risk, a referral to a social worker is needed. These referrals are often made as part of the carer neglect tip-off process, see <a href="../carers/009-08060120-03.html">Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA) carer neglect tip-off reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of these situations include allegations of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
family violence</li>
		<li>
elder abuse or neglect</li>
		<li>
financial abuse</li>
		</ul>
<p>This also includes disclosure from the care receiver that they are not being cared for, and the care receiver has concerns for their safety if the carer payment/allowance is cancelled.</p>

<p>Care receiver at risk referrals are often sent with little or no notes to protect the informants identity or if the allegations are sensitive in nature. The social worker must contact the referring Service Officer before undertaking the assessment to gain full details of the referral reason. </p>

<p>Service Officers must send the care receiver at risk referrals on the care receiver's record for privacy reasons. If social workers identify sensitive information has been placed on the carers record they are to take appropriate action to remove this information.</p>

<p>Social workers should attempt to contact the informant and the care receiver in the first instance followed by attempts to discuss the care situation with the carer and relevant third parties. Social workers must assess the appropriateness of contacting the care receiver taking into account risk issues and any medical conditions that may impact on their ability to contribute to the assessment.</p>

<p>It is important for social workers to be mindful that the information provided via the tip-off is an allegation only and details of the tip-off are not to be shared with either the carer or care receiver. If either the carer or the care receiver queries the purpose of contact, the social worker should advise that they are conducting a review.</p>

<p>Care receiver at risk assessments involve the social worker making an assessment of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The welfare of the care receiver including addressing the specific allegations </li>
		<li>
If the carer is providing sufficient care to be qualified for carer allowance/payment</li>
		<li>
If the carer is no longer providing care and the recommendation is to cancel, the social worker must assess the risk and discuss safety planning with the care receiver for when the carer’s payments are cancelled </li>
		</ul>
<p>The Social Work intervention will involve&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
assessing the risk, </li>
		<li>
making a recommendation about payment eligibility, and </li>
		<li>
making sure appropriate support services are in place</li>
		</ul>
<p>It may be appropriate to contact third parties to discuss the adequacy of the care being provided or risk issues that have been identified. See Resources for more details to support the social workers conversation. This includes examples of caring activities, third party verification and a link to a list of possible external referrals.</p>

<p>Social workers should attempt to contact the carer to discuss the care situation. </p>

<p>If the social worker has been unable to make contact, the Service Officer will need to make attempts to contact before cancelling their payment and the social worker should make the care receiver aware of this. </p>

<p>Concerns may be raised about a carer’s capacity to care&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when processing a new claim, it is apparent on the carer’s record that the carer has physical or mental health conditions that may impact their ability to provide care</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for example, the carer may be receiving Disability Support Pension (DSP), have a reduced work capacity or have provided recent medical certificates</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the carer or a third party may advise that the carer has been diagnosed with a medical condition subsequent to receiving CP/CA</li>
		</ul>
<p>These assessments will involve the social worker gaining detailed information about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the medical condition and associated care needs of the care receiver</li>
		<li>
the level of care actually provided by the carer</li>
		<li>
if any other party helps with the care</li>
		<li>
the carer’s own medical condition and any impacts this may have on their capacity to meet the needs of the care receiver</li>
		</ul>
<p>These assessments may involve the social worker interviewing the carer, care receiver and any relevant third party services involved to assess the level of care provided. </p>

<p>The social worker must review the medical information available on the customer’s records and make sure that it is consistent with information provided by the carer. </p>

<p>Medical information can be found on document tools or by viewing the CRS screen in Customer First on the carers’ record.  </p>

<p>Multiple carer situations involve 2 or more customers claiming to provide care to each other. For example, a mother with a physical disability is claiming to care for an adult child with an intellectual disability, while the adult child is claiming to care for their partner with a mental illness. In these situations, it can be difficult for the Service Officer to determine which party is caring for whom and their capacity to do so. </p>

<p>For carer payment there is no legislative restriction on a carer receiving CP for a care receiver who in turn receives CP for caring for another care receiver. For carer allowance however, an adult care receiver cannot qualify for carer allowance for another adult with a disability but can qualify for dependent children. For more details, see <a href="../carers/009-04030020-01.html">Eligibility for Carer Payment (CP) when a care receiver is aged 16 years or over.</a> </p>

<p>In these situations, the social worker must contact all parties involved to ascertain the level of care they are providing and if they need care themselves. Part of the social worker’s assessment will involve determining the carer’s capacity to provide care if they also have health conditions themselves. It may be appropriate for the social worker to contact Treating Health Professionals or other third parties for details about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
each persons’ care needs, </li>
		<li>
capacity to provide that care, and </li>
		<li>
if they are actually doing so to support the assessment </li>
		</ul>
<p>As these situations involve multiple customers claiming to be providing care, details of the social workers assessment of if care is actually being provided must be documented on each carer’s record. A recommendation is needed if the customer is providing sufficient care for qualification for carer payment/allowance and if they have capacity to do so if they also have medical conditions and need care themselves.</p>

<p>Disputed care situations occur when 2 or more customers claim to be providing care for the same care receiver, however, information in the claim does not meet the criteria for 2 carers to be granted. See <a href="../carers/009-04060000-01.html">Carer Payment (CP) for 2 or more carers in respect of the same care receiver</a>.</p>

<p>In these situations, the Service Officer will usually discuss the situation with the person lodging the claim and attempt to resolve the dispute. A referral to social work will be made if the dispute cannot be resolved by the Service Officer or if Family and Domestic Violence is indicated. </p>

<p>The social worker must contact each person claiming to be providing care, the care receiver (if appropriate) and any third parties such as support services or treating health professionals that may be able to provide confirmation of who is actually providing care. </p>

<p>Disputed care situations often involve complex family dynamics and may include Family and Domestic Violence or elder abuse. The social worker needs to be mindful of each customer’s privacy when contacting carers and must not disclose the identity of the other claimant. </p>

<p>Disputed care assessments will involve the social worker making a recommendation about which customer is eligible to receive carer payment/allowance. This will involve recommending that one customers’ claim be rejected or their payment be cancelled. As part of a holistic social work assessment, it is important to ascertain the safety of the care receiver/carer when the rejection/cancellation occurs. </p>

<p>In most care situations, it is generally accepted that constant care is being provided if scores from the customers claim and medical information meet eligibility requirements. If doubt exists about if the claimant is personally providing constant care, further investigation in the form of a social work interview may be appropriate if Service Officer investigations have not been able to ascertain the level of care being provided. </p>

<p>These referrals may include situations where the carer does not reside with the care receiver, or the carer is claiming to provide care for 2 or more care receivers.  </p>

<p>The social worker should make attempts to contact the carer, all care receivers and any relevant third parties to assess the level of care actually being provided. </p>

<p>Carer referrals often relate to either a new claim or a customer already receiving a payment. It is important that the social worker make sufficient effort to gather the information needed to prevent overpayments or incorrect decisions being made. </p>

<p>Social workers must make multiple attempts to contact all parties involved before finalising the referral. This may include the current carer and/or new claimant, the care receiver and nominee if applicable. All contacts must be documented on the record.</p>

<p>If there is a new claim involved, the social worker is to send a Q164 letter to the new claimant requesting contact. </p>

<p>If attempts to contact those involved have been unsuccessful and the letter has not been responded to after 14 days, the social worker must generate a CSAT Assessment Finalised Fast Note, so that the Carer Processing Team can process the outstanding claim.</p>

<p>Capacity to care assessments must be documented on the carer record with a recommendation in a document and details of the assessment in a SWIS case note or general report. </p>

<p>Multiple Carer and Disputed Care Assessments may need to be recorded on multiple records if the recommendation affects the payments of more than one customer. </p>

<p>The social worker must be careful not to breach privacy and avoid recording one customer’s information on the record of another customer. This is particularly important if the care receiver has disclosed family violence or carer neglect issues, as these allegations must not be recorded on the carer’s record. In this instance, the social worker should create a DOC on the carer’s record that refers the Service Officer to the care receives record where full details can be recorded. </p>

<p>Most Carer Assessments will need a report to be written due to the complexity of the care situation and the amount of information gathered from multiple parties. If the assessment is not complex or sensitive, the social worker can record the information on a DOC on the document list. </p>

<p>Any adverse decision needs a report to make sure that all information that has informed the rejection or cancellation of a payment is recorded for use in any future appeals. </p>

<p>If it is the social worker’s assessment that the carer does not have capacity to provide care, the social worker must generate a CSAT Assessment Finalised Fast Note. This will be allocated to the Carer Processing Team to action the outstanding claim or cancel the payment as per social work recommendation.</p>

<p>A referral to the CSAT social work team can be made for a Carer Specialised Assessment (CSAT). This is if the Service Officer identifies that the Care Needs Assessment may not be accurately reflecting the level of care needed for a child care receiver. </p>

<p>Carer Payment (child) claims rely on information provided in the Medical report completed by the&#58;</p>

Treating Health Professional (THP), and </li>
		<li>
Care needs assessment (CNA) completed by the carer</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some situations, the carer would qualify based on the THP report, however, does not achieve a qualifying CNA score. </p>

<p>Carer Specialised Assessments involve social workers collecting more details about the care provided to help the delegate in making a determination for Carer Payment. See <a href="../carers/009-04070060-03.html">Carer Specialist Assessment Team (CSAT) referrals for Carer Payment (CP) (child)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Only CSAT social workers </strong>conduct Carer Specialised Assessments (CSATs). If a social worker has received a referral via an incorrect WLM category, contact the CSAT SWSM or a member of the CSAT team. To contact the Carers Specialist Assessment Social Work Team use code <strong>CT1</strong> in <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12060020-05.html">Office Locator</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SWIS</strong> – CSAT social workers are the only staff that can select the Carer Specialised Assessment option in SWIS. This is because it generates a report specific to CSAT assessments. If a Social worker has incorrectly generated one of these reports, request a SWIS deletion. </p>

<p>When a claim is lodged for Carer Payment (child), the Treating Health Professional (THP) will identify if the child has a terminal illness with a life expectancy that is likely to be 24 months or less. Once the terminal indicator has been coded, a review will be generated after 2 years and every year following if the condition has not changed. </p>

<p>Due to the sensitivity of these situations, a referral is made for a social worker from the CSAT team to contact these carers at the 24 and 36 month reviews. </p>

<p>The social work will identify if the child’s condition has changed and if it is appropriate for a review to be undertaken. </p>

<p>If the child’s condition has not changed or they are nearing the end of life, CSAT social workers can recommend that the review be postponed. </p>
