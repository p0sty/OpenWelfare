an employer determination has been made that they have to deliver PPL to one of their employees</li>

a payability determination has been made about 1 of their employees</li>

		</ul>
<p>When an employer successfully registers for PPL through Business Hub, they will receive an automatic notification in Business Hub.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a PPL claim is made not effective (NEF) the employer determination will be revoked and an Employer Obligation Ceased letter is automatically generated. When the employee re-claims PPL, re-index the initial claim as a new claim. This will generate an employer determination letter and the employer is required to respond to this new request. There is potential an employer may receive an Employer Obligation Ceased letter and an Employer Determination letter for the same employee, resulting in enquiries from the employer.</p>

<p>The employer will also receive Payment Advice Reports each time Services Australia sends PPL funding amounts for their employee/s.</p>

<p>When an employer contacts Services Australia to advise their employee does not meet the PPL work test or is not known by the employer and they intend to apply for a formal review of the employer determination, Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team (PPLEPT) staff must collect and record additional information from the employer.</p>

<p><strong>Employer advises employee does not meet the PPL work test</strong></p>

<p>Questions to ask the employer and add answers in a <strong>DOC</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>Suggested questions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Why do you believe the employee does not meet the PPL work test?</li>
		<li>
When did the employee commence working for you?</li>
		<li>
What was their last date of employment?</li>
		<li>
Has the employee worked 330 hours in a 10 month period during their 13 month work test period?</li>
		<li>
In the employee's work test period did they have unpaid leave? </li>
		<li>
Did the employee have a break of more than 84 days (12 weeks) of unpaid leave?</li>
		<li>
Did your business qualify for and did you pay the employee JobKeeper Payment?</li>
		<li>
Has your business been affected by COVID-19 which may have qualified the employee to a COVID-19 Disaster Payment?</li>
		</ul>
<p>Employees who have not completed 330 hours of paid work for an employer in their 10 month (295 days) qualifying period may still meet the PPL work test when other factors are considered. Some of these other factors may include an employee having&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
previous periods of PPL/DAP received during the work test period</li>
		<li>
multiple employers</li>
		<li>
self-employment</li>
		<li>
complications or illnesses related to the pregnancy</li>
		<li>
experienced special circumstances which affected their ability to meet the work test, including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
family and domestic violence</li>
			<li>
severe medical condition or caring for a close family member with a severe medical condition</li>
			<li>
natural disaster declared by the Commonwealth or a state or territory</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Dangerous Job Provision</strong></p>

<p>Birth mothers who stopped working in a dangerous job will be able to move their <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">PPL work test</a> period.</p>

<p><strong>Extended Work Test Provision</strong></p>

<p>PPL employees who do not meet the standard work test because they stopped work, or had their work hours reduced, due to coronavirus (COVID-19) may be able to access the Extended Work Test.</p>

<p>The extended work test will apply to employees who have a child with an expected/actual date of birth or adoption between 22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>The work test period for these employees will be extended from 13 months to 20 months before the birth or adoption of their child. See <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">Paid Parental Leave Scheme work test</a>.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Disaster Payments (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021)</strong></p>

<p>PPL employees who do not meet the standard work test because they stopped work, or had their work hours reduced due to COVID-19 lockdowns on or after 3 June 2021 may still meet <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">the PPL scheme work test</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Further investigation required</strong></p>

<p>If the employer still believes the employee does not meet the work test, advise them their concerns will be referred to the relevant team for further investigation.</p>

<p>In these cases, Services Australia can commence a Secretary initiated review to determine if the employee meets the work test. See <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-06020000-01.html">Secretary initiated review of decision</a> for additional information.</p>

<p>PPLEPT staff dual skilled in FAO processing are to undertake a Subject Matter Expert (SME) review to confirm the employee meets the work test.</p>

<p>Staff not dual skilled in FAO processing will create a referral for allocation. On the employee’s record, use <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-03.html">Fast Note</a>, select <strong>Auto Text</strong>, use <strong>Families</strong> &gt; <strong>Enquiry</strong> &gt; <strong>PPL Work test - Sec Review</strong>.<strong> </strong>The review will be allocated to a dual skilled PPLEPT/FCC staff member.</p>

<p>After completing the investigation, the employer will receive a letter advising them if they no longer need to provide the PPL to their employee.</p>

<p>If the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
WTS review has not been completed and 14 days have already elapsed with the employer determination and an MFU becomes due, </li>
		<li>
the PPLEPT are to commence the <a href="../families/007-13030010-01.html">assisted dispute resolution for employer determination for Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a> process</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ADR has commenced, more than 21 days have passed since it started, and the WTS review has not been completed, </li>
		<li>
the PPLEPT are to hold the <strong>ADR DOC</strong> for 7 days until the WTS review is completed</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the employer still needs to provide PPL, make genuine attempts to contact to advise&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the outcome of the Secretary initiated review, and </li>
		<li>
their obligation to accept the employer determination</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Employer advises employee is not known by the employer</strong></p>

<p>In some circumstances, an employee's personal details will differ from Services Australia to their employers. Employees have the option when they submit their claim to provide any other name(s) they are known by with their employer. For example, their maiden name. The Employer Determination Letter received by the employer will include an employee identification number and other name provided by the employee in their claim.</p>

<p>If the employer contacts to say they need more details before accepting the employee, the PPLEPT can ask the employer for extra details. This can include, employee's date of birth, address to establish an employee link to be satisfied Services Australia has the right employee.</p>

<p>If the employer is unable or unwilling to provide the additional employee details, the PPLEPT must attempt to contact the customer. If attempts to contact the customer have been unsuccessful, issue a Q999 letter requesting the customer contact Services Australia to provide the relevant information.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-09010030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains an example of Q999 text used by PPLEPT staff seeking additional information from the employee.</p>

<p>After the Q999 is sent, PPLEPT staff are to&#58;</p>

		<li>
the PPLEPT are to commence the <a href="../families/007-13030010-01.html">assisted dispute resolution for employer determination for Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a> process</li>

<p>If the employer will deliver PPL, an Employer determination letter will issue outlining the obligations of providing PPL to their employee.</p>

<p>The letter must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
employee's (legal) name</li>
		<li>
employee's eligibility for PPL</li>
		<li>
period for which the employer must provide PPL to the employee</li>
		<li>
request to verify the employer's PPL details have not changed</li>
		<li>
employer's obligations under the PPL scheme</li>
		<li>
review and appeal rights of the employer if the employer disagrees with the decision, they are to provide PPL to the employee</li>
		</ul>
<p>Send the employer determination letter electronically or by mail.</p>

<p>If the employer does not know the employee by the name used in the employer determination, the employer must be encouraged to speak with the employee referenced by the employee ID number. The Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team (PPLEPT) cannot provide name information stored on Services Australia systems to employers. However, if the employer provides the PPLEPT with an alternative name, the PPLEPT can confirm whether the employee is known to Services Australia by that name.</p>

<p>Services Australia will work with employers to ensure the PPL amount is advanced to them before they are required to provide PPL to an employee. There will be no obligation on an employer to provide PPL until they have received the required funds from Services Australia.</p>

<p>Payments will be electronically transferred to the employer's nominated bank account by Services Australia and a payment advice will be issued (either electronic or in another written form) with each payment. The payment advice can be issued in different formats&#58; CSV, HTM, PDF and XML. The employer can request the payment advice to be issued in 2 different formats. </p>

<p>CSV files can be loaded into various spreadsheet applications, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Microsoft Excel</li>
		<li>
Notepad, or</li>
		<li>
WordPad</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an employer is using Microsoft Excel, it is important they ensure the date format is set as ddmmyyyy before downloading and saving the CSV file into Microsoft Excel. The date format ddmmyyyy is compatible with the CSV file date format. If the date format is not set as ddmmyyyy when the CSV file is downloaded and saved in Microsoft Excel, the leading 0 from the date value may drop off, resulting in the date format displayed as dmmyyyy. Employers can fix this by changing the date format settings in their Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to ddmmyyyy.</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of using Microsoft Excel, employers can download and open the CSV file in Notepad or WordPad. Both will maintain the correct CSV file date format of ddmmyyyy.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the employer's nominated bank account refers to an account 'held and maintained' by the employer with a financial institution to which PPL funding amounts can be paid, and includes an account held with an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI). The <a href="../families/007-09010030-04.html">References</a> page contains further detail on ADI.</p>

<p>Services Australia is able to make up to 9 fortnightly instalments of PPL funding to an employer. However, an employer can elect to receive funding amounts in 3 x 6 weekly instalments.</p>

<p>Payments will be transferred before the employer's pay cycle. This will be before the pay cut-off date for any changes to the employee's pay for that pay period.</p>

<p>For employers with multiple employees in receipt of PPL, the funds will be issued for all employees, for each pay cycle from Services Australia.</p>

<p>If an employer responds to the employer determination and they provide an alternate ABN to the one advised by the employee they are, by action, presenting themselves as the employee's nominated employer.</p>

<p>The provision of an ABN for PPL purposes does not require confirmation from the employee.</p>

<p>For example, a business may operate several business names under the same ABN, provided they all operate under the same business structure. If additional businesses operate under different business structures, they require their own ABN. An employee must be linked to the ABN within the business structure under which they are employed. However, internal accounting practises used within a business are, unless specified or regulated by legislation, decisions for the business to determine. Therefore, a different ABN can be used at the employer's discretion.</p>

<p>For example, Woolworths Townsville may select to pay their employees PPL through a national office.</p>

<p>Employers who contact Services Australia to advise they would like to elect a centralised ABN for PPL purposes will need the information collected and be referred to PPLEPT to update the ABN table. The Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team (PPLEPT) can refer to the <a href="../families/007-09010030-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Employer_or_emp">Employer or employee reports a change to an ABN for PPL purposes</a> table for more information.</p>

<p>Mapping will occur during the claim processing and will use a new index table, which stores the centralised ABN data, and will be used during the paymaster determination.</p>

<p>The PPLEPT will maintain the data contained in the ABN index.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some instances, employers are not required to have an ABN, for example, people who are not in a business and employ household workers, such as nannies, cleaners or gardeners. In these instances, Services Australia <a href="../families/007-09010020-01.html">will deliver PPL to the employee</a>.</p>

<p>PPL amounts paid to employers will not be classified as public monies under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.</p>

<p>Employers have an obligation to provide PPL in line with their employee's normal pay cycle. This includes payment delivery dates impacted by employer shut down periods and national public holidays. See <a href="../families/007-09010020-01.html">Delivery of Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a>.</p>

<p>Employers will not need a separate bank account for PPL and may earn interest on amounts held in their accounts. As is normally the case, any interest will be treated as income for taxation purposes.</p>

<p>Employers will not be required to provide any regular banking reports to Services Australia. However, employers must keep proper financial records of the receipt of PPL amounts and of payments made to an employee as general business practice. Employers will assist if there are any disputes about the funding amount paid by Services Australia to the employer, or payments provided to the employee (for example, payslips).</p>

<p>PPL payments must be included in the total amounts appearing on an employee's annual or part-year payment summary. The gross amount of PPL provided to an employee in a pay period must appear on a notice (payslip or separate notice) to the employee for that particular pay period. The total amount of Pay As You Go (PAYG) withheld from the total gross taxable payment for that period must also be included in the notice.</p>

<p>If an employer fails to comply with these responsibilities <a href="../families/007-13030010-01.html">dispute resolution procedures</a> may apply.</p>

<p><strong>Leave entitlements</strong></p>

<p>An employee may receive PPL before, after or at the same time as employer-provided paid leave such as recreation leave and maternity leave, and employer-provided unpaid leave. When PPL is received at the same time as a type of leave that ordinarily results in the accrual of leave entitlements or counts as service for the accrual of other entitlements, these existing accrual arrangements will not be affected.</p>

<p>PPL does not replace existing workplace entitlements.</p>

<p><strong>Superannuation</strong></p>

<p>Employers will not be required to make superannuation contributions in respect of PPL and must be quarantined from other amounts which attract a superannuation guarantee liability.</p>

<p>PPL will not be subject to payroll tax and must be quarantined from other amounts which attract a payroll tax liability.</p>

<p>Keeping in touch provisions apply for a PPL claim for a child born before 1 July 2023.</p>

<p>PPL includes a 'keeping in touch' provision which will allow employees to participate in workplace activities for up to 10 days before they return to work.</p>

<p>Employees can access keeping in touch days during their PPL period or Flexible PPL days before they have returned to work for the first time since the birth or adoption of their child. Once the employee has returned to work, they cannot access keeping in touch, even if they have not used all 10 days.</p>

<p>Work undertaken under this provision will not be considered a return to work for the purposes of the PPL scheme.</p>

<p>Both the employee and the employer must consent to the employee performing work for the employer on a keeping in touch day.</p>

<p>Keeping in touch days requested by the employee cannot occur within 14 days of the birth/entry into care of the child.</p>

<p>Employer requested keeping in touch days must not be within 42 days after the date of birth/entry into care.</p>

<p>The National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act 2009 incorporates a corresponding 'keeping in touch' provision, which allows eligible employees to work up to 10 days during the 12 months unpaid parental leave period without affecting their leave entitlement. 'Keeping in touch' days taken for PPL will count towards the 10 day limit provided under the National Employment Standards.</p>

<p>Work undertaken as part of 'keeping in touch' provisions will count as service and will attract usual employment provisions including pay, superannuation and leave accrual.</p>

<p>See <a href="../families/007-05040040-01.html">Parental Leave Pay (PPL) customer, for a child born before 1 July 2023, returns to work</a> for questions and answers about the 'keeping in touch' provision.</p>
