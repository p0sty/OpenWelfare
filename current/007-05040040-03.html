<p>Generally, primary claimants must claim PPL before they return to work. This is due to the backdating rules for the PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> different backdating rules apply for customers that meet the extended work test. These customers can&#58;</p>

claim PPL after they have returned to work, and </li>
		<li>
nominate a start date (NSD) before their return to work date</li>

<p><strong>Claim lodged within 28 days of the child’s birth or adoption</strong></p>

<p>If a customer that has returned to work before claiming PPL, lodges an effective claim <strong>within 28 days of the child’s birth or adoption</strong>, they will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be eligible for the PPL period from the child’s date of birth/adoption until the day before the return to work date</li>
		<li>
be eligible for up to 30 Flexible PPL days</li>
		<li>
be able to transfer their unused portion of the PPL period or their entire PPL period to another person. The other person must claim and be eligible for PPL as a secondary claimant. See <a href="../families/007-09020020-01.html">Eligibility for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) as a secondary or tertiary claimant for children born or entering care before 1 July 2023</a></li>

<p>In most cases, PPL cannot be paid on days when the customer is working. Customers should claim PPL before they have returned to work. It can be paid on days when the customer is on paid or unpaid leave. Customers cannot receive JobKeeper Payment and PPL at the same time.</p>

<p>However, a customer can receive JobKeeper Payment after the birth of a child (or recently adopted child) and before their Nominated Start Date (NSD), only where they have not returned to work.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who received the COVID-19 Disaster Payment in the period between the birth of the child and starting PPL are <strong>not</strong> considered to have returned to work, as they have not performed paid work.</p>

<p>For the purposes of PPL a customer is working on a day if they perform paid work <strong>except </strong>where the work is for a permissible purpose or an allowable exception reason, including those who have relinquished the child as part of an adoption or surrogacy arrangement.</p>

<p>A return to work can be notified up to 30 days in advance by the customer or their employer.</p>

<p>Primary claimants can perform work with no effect on their ongoing PPL entitlement. </p>

<p>The introduction of the ‘Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits)’ meant customers could not receive JobKeeper Payment and PPL for the same period. There have not been any changes to the PPL rules regarding return to work for bereavement cases. </p>

<p>The Smart Centres Families Bereavement and DOP Team (DOP region code) process PPL bereavement claims. See <a href="../families/007-04050010-01.html">Death of a family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme child</a>.</p>

<p>A birth mother’s (primary claimant) return to work can be disregarded if it occurs within the period that starts 14 days after the child is born and ends on the day the child is discharged from hospital.</p>

<p>If the birth mother returns to work within 14 days following the birth of the child they do not meet the requirements for an exception due to an allowable reason.</p>

<p>Return to work rules were updated to include an additional exception for health professionals, emergency services or essential workers who have returned to work on or after 12 March 2020 in response to a state, territory or national emergency (including COVID-19).</p>

<p>Customers who return to work can continue to receive PPL if they&#58;</p>

are a health professional, emergency services worker or an essential worker, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
returned to work during a declared state, territory or national emergency, <strong>and</strong></li>

returned to work in response to an emergency, either voluntarily or recalled by their employer</li>

<p>To determine if the customer meets the exception, ask the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
what date they returned to work, to ensure it was during the emergency period</li>
		<li>
are they a health professional, emergency services or essential worker</li>
		<li>
did they return to work <strong>in response to</strong> an emergency </li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer was scheduled to return to work at that time anyway, they do not meet the exception. Only customers who have returned to work <strong>in response</strong> to an emergency are covered by this exception.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> it is not a requirement that customers provide evidence to support their return to work reason. However, in limited circumstances Service Officers can request evidence if they are not satisfied the customer meets the requirements for this exception reason. Evidence can include a letter from their employer stating the customer returned to work because they are an essential worker responding to a state, territory or national emergency.</p>

<p>Customers cannot work on days they want to access Flexible PPL. Exceptions apply for work performed for an allowable exception reason or a permissible purpose, including Keeping in Touch (KIT) days.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Keeping In Touch (KIT) days are considered as working for a permissible purpose and can be accessed on a connected or scheduled Flexible PPL day provided the customer has not returned to work.

<p>If the customer has claimed Flexible PPL on a date and they are advising they worked or are now intending to work on that date, and the work was not performed for a permissible purpose or allowable exception reason, it must be rejected or withdrawn. Days that are rejected or withdrawn&#58;</p>

return to the customer’s balance of unclaimed Flexible PPL days, and</li>
		<li>
can be claimed for another date within 2 years of the child’s birth or adoption</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has been paid Flexible PPL for this date, they may have been overpaid.</p>
