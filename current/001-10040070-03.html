<p>Job seekers must contact their provider beforehand, where possible, if they are unable to attend or comply with a term in their Job Plan, including attending an appointment.</p>

<p>Prior contact is met when the job seeker contacts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their employment service provider, or</li>
		<li>
another person or organisation identified in their Job Plan, for example the Job Plan may require a job seeker to contact their Work For the Dole (WFD) co-ordinator if they can't attend WFD</li>
		</ul>
<p>When Participation Solutions Team (PST) staff investigating a failure establish a job seeker had a reasonable excuse, a financial penalty will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>not be</strong> applied if</li>
			<ul>			<li>
prior contact occurred, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
it was unreasonable to expect the job seeker to make prior contact</li>		</ul>

			<ul>			<li>
prior contact did not occur, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
it was reasonable to expect the job seeker to have done so</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Prior contact may not always be possible. A job seeker may contact shortly after a requirement. This may show genuine intentions of the job seeker trying and should be considered when making the decision.</p>

<p>All compliance investigations focus on the job seeker's reason/s for not complying with a compulsory requirement. This is the reported non-compliance event and is able to be reviewed in the Participation Report sent by the Provider.</p>

<p>During the investigation, the job seeker must be given a chance to explain why they did not meet the requirement.</p>

<p>If the job seeker indicates their circumstances prevented them from complying, PST staff need to question further to ensure they have a clear understanding of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how the circumstance directly affected their ability to comply</li>
		<li>
if prior contact was not made, did the circumstance prevent prior contact from occurring?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>PST staff must consider updating the job seeker's Circumstances Impacting Compliance to reflect the job seeker's current circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>For assistance assessing impacts of a circumstance, it may be appropriate to consult with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a PST Local Peer Support (LPS), or</li>
		<li>
a PST-skilled social worker, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12080010-01.html">Accessing a PST-skilled social worker</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>A circumstance impacting compliance may have been recorded because of a previous compliance discussion. Whilst these indicators do not automatically provide a reasonable excuse for a specific failure, they may provide helpful guidance around how the circumstance impacts the job seeker's participation.</p>

consult with an appropriate specialist to better understand the likely impact of the disclosed crisis upon the job seeker's ability to comply</li>
