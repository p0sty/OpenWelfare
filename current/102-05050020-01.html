		<div class="block">

<p>Generally, when a child leaves a customer's care long-term or permanently, the customer stops being entitled to family assistance, Paid Parental Leave payments and ancillary benefits for the child. Their entitlement to income support payments may also be affected. The gaining carer of the child may become eligible for payments.</p>

<p>Customers must tell Services Australia if a child leaves their care, even if another person is expected to claim for the child.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Since 1 July 2010, a mutual customer can notify either Centrelink or Child Support of changes to their care arrangements. The agency receiving the information will make the care determination and the care information will be <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51130110-01.html">transferred to the other agency</a> for the assessment of family assistance and child support entitlements.

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>A child may continue to be an FTB child</strong> or Regular Care Child (RCC) of a customer during short-term (temporary) absences, generally less than 4 weeks. Temporary absence from care provisions must not be applied when the change of care is formal, even if it is less than 28 days.</p>

<p>Formal care can include instances where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a child is removed by a <strong>relevant</strong> state child protection service and placed into the care of another carer</li>
		<li>
the care is legally authorised by a court</li>
		<li>
the change of care involves a change in legal responsibility (whether this is removal of legal responsibility from a carer or where an additional carer gains legal responsibility of the child without the current care losing legal responsibility)</li>
		</ul>
<p>However, in some circumstances, a longer period may still be regarded as a short-term absence that does not affect FTB eligibility. For example, a child may be away on holiday with relatives for longer than 4 weeks. The child may be given money for expenses by their parent who is also still responsible for making decisions about the child's welfare while the child is away. In these cases, the child <a href="../families/007-07040050-01.html">may still be an FTB child</a> of the parent.</p>

<p>If a customer is advising of a care change, the Service Officer needs to identify if it is a <strong>temporary</strong> change in care. If the Service Officer needs help in determining the eligibility for temporary care, see <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-23051044-01.html">Local Peer Support (LPS)</a> or a Service Support Officer (SSO) using standard escalation protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Once a temporary change in care has been clearly identified and the temporary care decision made,</strong> <strong>DOC </strong>the customer's record with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the temporary care details (including start and end date)</li>
		<li>
the customer has met the criteria for temporary care</li>
		</ul>
<p>Any evidence relevant to the decision should also be documented and scanned to the record.</p>

<p>If a child is moving or has temporarily moved into the care of an Approved Care Organisation (ACO), the customer may not be eligible for temporary care provisions, even in cases where the care is less than 4 weeks. Care must be taken to determine if the temporary change in care is formal (legal/court order) or informal (customer has delegated their care temporarily to an ACO). For further information - See <a href="../families/007-07040030-01.html">Eligibility for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for Approved Care Organisations (ACO)</a> - ACO Smart Centre Processing.</p>

<p>The <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-05.html">Resources</a> page has FTB examples of legal responsibility and temporary care provisions identifying when temporary care is <strong>not</strong> applicable.</p>

<p>For <strong>child support </strong>purposes only, a one-off block of 100% care is when a person <strong>unexpectedly</strong> gains 100% care of the child for at least 4 weeks (it may be less depending on the circumstances).</p>

<p><strong>For children born or entering care on or after 1 July 2023</strong></p>

<p>A child may continue to be a PPL child of a customer during temporary absence from care. Generally, when the birth mother, adoptive parent or other parent is incapable of caring for the child for a period of less than 26 weeks their Parental Leave Pay may continue to be paid. </p>

<p><strong>For children born or entering care before 1 July 2023</strong></p>

<p><strong>Parental Leave Pay</strong></p>

<p><strong>For children born or entering care on or after 1 July 2023</strong></p>

<p>Claimants must have care of a PPL child on a day to receive a PPL day. As more than one carer can have care on a day, multiple claimants can receive PPL on the same day.</p>

<p>A Primary carer determination will only be required where a customer claims PPL in exceptional circumstances. The customer must be or expected to be the primary carer before the child’s 1st birthday/anniversary of care. However, they do not need to be primary carer on a PPL day, just have care on that day.</p>

<p>PPL may continue to paid in the following situations&#58;</p>

the birth mother relinquishes care of their child as part of the process of adoption or a surrogacy arrangement</li>
		<li>
the child has been removed from the birth mother's care by a State or Territory child protection agency</li>
		<li>
the child has been unlawfully removed from the customer's care</li>

<p><strong>For children born or entering care before 1 July 2023</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer must be the primary carer of the child to be eligible for Parental Leave Pay (PPL).

For income support payments, the customer will no longer be considered a principal carer unless they have another qualifying dependent child in their care. PP customers may need to claim another payment such as JobSeeker Payment (JSP). If the customer remains eligible for Parenting Payment Single (PPS), they may need to meet compulsory part-time participation requirements, depending on the age of their youngest PP child. JSP/Youth Allowance (YA)/Special Benefit (SpB) customers will be subject to full-time mutual obligation requirements if they are no longer a principal carer of a dependent child.<br>See <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-04030010-01.html">Principal carer of a dependent child</a>.

<p>If a child stops being in a person's care <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050040-01.html">without their consent</a> on or after 1 July 2012, discretion can be applied so that the percentage of care can immediately be based on the actual level of care if there are special circumstances which support that outcome. The decision would result in the losing carer's eligibility for FTB for the child stopping. The person who has actual care of the child may be eligible for FTB payments for the child if they meet the normal eligibility criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-04.html">References</a> page has links to the Family Assistance Guide and further information about the length of interim periods.</p>

<p><strong>PPL scheme payments</strong></p>

<p>PPL scheme payments may continue to be payable to the customer if their child is removed from their care without their consent. The customer must be taking reasonable steps to have the child returned to their care.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, a person can continue to be paid an income support payment as a principal carer if they continue to take reasonable steps to recover care of the child. In the event of a temporary absence of more than 8 weeks, advice must be sought from the appropriate Level 3 Policy Support Helpdesk (by the Level 2 helpdesk) before making a determination.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For customers receiving CCS, a short-term absence will not affect eligibility, if the child is still considered to be in the customer's care and the customer is still liable for the child care fees. If a child leaves a customer's care, the customer's CCS for that child is to be cancelled.</p>

<p>Child records exist separately and need to be linked to the record of each customer caring for the child. When details for a child are updated, the changes will 'ripple' to all other customer records linked to the child record. 'Shadow' child records show for customers in other environments who share a child's details.</p>
