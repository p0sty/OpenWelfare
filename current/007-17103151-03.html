A course between a Certificate II to Graduate Diploma (AQF level 2 to 8), for further detail see <a href="../families/007-17103151-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Study_levels_fo">Study levels for ACCS (Transition to Work)</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers should conduct relevant checks to ensure the course the customer has enrolled in is with an approved education institution.</p>

<p>Further proof of enrolment information is required for customers studying with Open Universities Australia.

<p>If a customer meets the study load requirements for their income support payment, they will also meet the study load requirements for ACCS (Transition to Work). In general, to be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work), the customer needs to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be studying at least 25 per cent of the full time study load to be considered part time</li>
		<li>
be studying at least 75 per cent of the full time study load to be considered full time</li>

<p>The study load can affect the overall time limit for Study. Further details can be found under <a href="../families/007-17103151-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Time_limits_app">Approved activity time limits table</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer meets the exceptional circumstances requirement of their income support payment, such as for Austudy where 66 per cent of the full time study load is considered full time, they would also be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work) for a full time study activity. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-04050040-01.html">Assessing eligibility for the 66% concessional study load for Austudy</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer starts studying at a level higher than a Certificate II (AQF level 2), or progresses to a higher level of the AQF, they cannot access ACCS (Transition to Work) to study at a level lower than their highest level of study. Only study a customer has undertaken in the last ten years is included in determining their highest level of study. </p>

<p>The ten year time period is applied from the date the customer completed the higher level of previous study.</p>

<p>This applies even if they have not completed a qualification or exhausted the time limit, or have not previously accessed ACCS (Transition to Work) to study at that level (unless the Skill Shortage List - Australia exemption applies).</p>

<p>Once a customer has completed a level of study when receiving ACCS (Transition to Work), or has exhausted the time limit for the level of study, they cannot access ACCS (Transition to Work) for that level of study.

<p><strong>Exception to Step Up Rule - Secondary Certificate of Education or University Enabling course</strong></p>

<p>The exception to the step up rule applies if the customer is studying a secondary course or preparatory course. This means that if all other eligibility criteria has been met, ACCS (Transition to Work) can be granted, regardless of the customer's highest level of prior study. Proof of enrolment provided by the customer should include details to confirm if the course being undertaken is a secondary or preparatory course.</p>

<p><strong>Exception to Step Up Rule - Six Week rule</strong></p>

<p>An exception is available to the step up rule where, on a <strong>single</strong> occasion, the customer studied a course of education or study at a higher level than the level at which they are currently studying for a period of <strong>less than six weeks</strong>. This means that this higher period of study will not be counted when applying the step up rule.</p>

<p>A customer can change their course of study (within the same level) if the time limit has not been exhausted for the same level of study.

To support the new application, customers need to provide supporting evidence/proof of enrolment for the new course.</p>

<p>Where a customer changes their course more than once, that it is their third change in the same course level, Service Officers are to request evidence of satisfactory progress of their previous course before the new course is accepted.

<p>If a customer is studying a course from Certificate II to a Graduate Diploma (AQF Level 2 to 8), they have to be making satisfactory progress in that course to meet ACCS (Transition to Work) study requirements.</p>

<p>Satisfactory progress means the customer is participating in the course and achieving the minimum requirements of that course to the satisfaction of the course provider (such as achieving a pass grade for at least one of their subjects).</p>

<p>A customer enrolled in a course 12 months or longer, is required to provide evidence of their progress towards course completion to continue to be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work) for that activity. In addition, if a customer has been studying for more than 6 months when applying for ACCS (Transition to Work), they will need to provide evidence of satisfactory progress as well as their proof of enrolment for study.</p>

<p>If a course is less than 12 months, the customer is still required to provide evidence of their progress, if requested.</p>

<p>If a customer is not attending their course, they are not participating in that approved activity which will result in them losing eligibility for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>Achieving the minimum requirements of a course to the satisfaction of the course provider may vary between course providers. It is up to the customer to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the proof of progression requirement stipulated by the course provider.

<p><strong>Two or more activities - the most beneficial activity principle</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer is participating in two or more activities that meet the ACCS (Transition to Work) activity requirements, the customer can select which of their activity/ies they would like assessed for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>Where more than one activity is selected, the Service Officer assessing the application will apply the highest time limit that can be applied, depending on the activities nominated by the customer. This is known as the most beneficial activity principle.</p>

<p>Where no activity is nominated by the customer, but more than two are listed, Service Officers will determine which is the most beneficial for the customer.</p>

<p>Generally, the hierarchy of time limits is&#58;</p>
		<ol>		<li>
Study</li>
		<li>
Training - Vocational</li>
		<li>
Training - Other non-vocational programs - that improve employment prospects</li>
		<li>
Work - paid, unpaid, work experience or internship placement, activity looking for work</li>
		<li>
Job Search</li>
		</ol>
<p>If the customer's activity is study, Service Officers should consider previous periods of study for which JETCCFA was paid as this could affect the remaining available time for particular activities nominated by the customer. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the system will identify any periods of JETCCFA relevant to the level of study to determine the time limit applicable to a course of study.</p>

<p>Time limits should be applied according to the evidence provided, such as course duration. That is, if no activity time limit is provided by the customer and there is no evidence regarding the time limit, additional evidence can be requested.</p>

<p>If an activity is ongoing and no end date is provided, such as work or looking for work, the maximum of 26 weeks is applied.</p>

<p><strong>More than one activity requirement met</strong></p>

<p>A customer's activity may meet more than one of the activity requirements. In particular, components of labour market programs may be assessed under more than one activity requirement. For example, Self-Employment Assistance has components of training and setting up a business. A customer undertaking this activity may have them assessed as training (for that component of the course), followed by an assessment for work (setting up a business). In this case, once the training component was completed, or the time limit exhausted, the customer would need to apply for ACCS (Transition to Work) again for the work component.</p>

<p>Some vocational training courses may meet the Study levels for ACCS (Transition to Work and could be assessed as a study activity instead of a work or training requirement. As study has a higher time limit than work or training activities, the study limit is applied as it is the most beneficial.</p>

<p>The processing Service Officer will decide which type of activity is to be recorded, and which time limit will apply to provide the greatest benefit to the customer.</p>
