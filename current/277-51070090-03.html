<p><strong>All</strong> exemptions based on the fear of family and domestic violence must be referred to a social worker. Assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customers should be undertaken jointly with an Indigenous Service Officer (ISO). The ISO provides assistance getting the information to help determine the case.</p>

<p>Social workers must discuss applications for exemptions due to cultural considerations with ISOs.</p>

customer's <strong>ex-partner is in prison</strong>, as no exemption applies for this reason. A child support assessment will still be required in these cases. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51010000-01.html">Helping customers apply for child support through Centrelink</a></li>
		<li>
customer's current <strong>partner is in prison</strong> and they are only apart due to the imprisonment. In this case they are still considered to be a couple and child support action is not appropriate</li>

<p>If not already provided ask the customer to provide the child's birth certificate to support the exemption application.</p>

<p>If the child's birth certificate shows the name of another person but the customer advises that person is not a parent of the child, the Secretary or Delegate needs to be satisfied that the other parent is not a parent of the child. Evidence that the person is not a parent of the child can be provided through a court ruling, a DNA test, or a separate statutory declaration from each party. The customer can apply for an exemption from seeking child support, however a Parentage Unknown exemption cannot be granted until the Secretary (Centrelink) or Registrar (Child Support) is satisfied that the person named on the birth certificate is not a parent of the child.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not issue a 'Child Support Statutory Declaration - you are a parent of the child/ren named' (<a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/customer/forms/cs4649">CS4649</a>) as this form is only used by the other parent if they agree that they are the parent.</p>

<p><strong>The birth certificate must be provided within 60 days of the exemption being requested.</strong> After this timeframe, the exemption will lapse and the customer will be considered not to have taken reasonable action to obtain child support. Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for the affected child will reduce to the base rate.</p>

<p><a href="../separated-parents/277-51070030-01.html">Update the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) code for the child/ren to 'MXR'</a> (maintenance exemption requested) from the date the exemption was requested ('<strong>MXR</strong>' can only be coded once per child). This will allow more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A to be paid for up to 60 days. Finalise the activity on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>The maintenance action code will automatically update to <strong>NMA</strong> (no maintenance action) after the 60 days if the birth certificate have not been provided unless the child is within a 13 week (91 day) timeframe Deciding Maintenance Action (DMA) period.</p>

<p>The Service Officer is to make a decision whether to grant or reject the exemption. In some cases, it is appropriate to pend the decision if evidence is to be provided. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070030-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) codes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exemption is pending evidence (for example, birth certificate)</strong></p>

<p>If a decision on the exemption will not be made straight away, use the Maintenance Action workflow to update the MAT code for the child/ren to '<strong>MXR</strong>' (maintenance exemption requested) from the date the exemption was requested (<strong>MXR</strong> can only be coded once per child). This will allow more than the base rate of FTB Part A to be paid for up to 60 days. Finalise the activity on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Exemption to be granted</strong></p>

<p>If the exemption is to be granted, the Service Officer must decide on the applicable start date for the exemption. When <strong>considering whether to backdate,</strong> issues that need to be taken into account are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is the customer advising that they are only applying now because they did not know they could apply for an exemption?</li>
		<li>
Look at <strong>DOC</strong>s and letters to see what the customer has previously been advised. Is it reasonable to accept that the customer was not aware they could apply for an exemption?</li>
		<li>
Did the customer previously have an exemption request rejected? If so, why?</li>
		<li>
Did the customer previously hold an exemption that dropped off?</li>
		<li>
If the customer has been receiving the base rate, did they question the rate decrease when they went to NMA no maintenance action?</li>
		<li>
What prevented the customer from requesting an exemption earlier?</li>
		</ul>
<p>Backdating an exemption may result in arrears if the customer was failing the MAT during the backdated period. In cases where arrears are generated and the customer has an existing debt, there must be sufficient grounds for a temporary exclusion from debt offsetting to be approved. When exceptional or unforeseen circumstances apply which may cause the customer to suffer severe financial hardship, customers can request to be temporarily excluded from debt recovery <strong>before </strong>money being taken from their FTB arrears, lump sum or top-up payments. <br>See <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting during family assistance reassessment, reconciliation and claim processing</a>.</p>

<p>Discharging arrears from a previous Child Support collect period must also be discussed. Customers that are granted an exemption (full or partial) are able to discharge any arrears owing on the child support case without having the discharged amount taken into account for Maintenance Income Test purposes.</p>

<p>If a decision on the exemption will not be made straight away, use the Maintenance Action workflow to <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070030-01.html">update the MAT code for the child/ren to 'MXR'</a> (maintenance exemption requested) from the date the exemption was requested (<strong>MXR</strong> can only be coded once per child). This will allow more than the base rate of FTB Part A to be paid for 60 days. Finalise the activity on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>An exemption may be backdated to 1 July of the previous financial year or the child's date of birth, whichever is the later. To backdate further, special circumstances for backdating a maintenance action exemption must first be established.</p>

<p>Maintenance income may still affect the customer's FTB Part A rate.</p>

<p><strong>Full exemptions</strong></p>

<p>If a full exemption is granted, all maintenance income received in the current financial year, including child support entitlements that existed before the exemption was granted, are included in the annualised child support amount.</p>

<p>When discussing the request for an exemption, the customer must be given information about the impact child support payments could have on their FTB if they are received at a later date. That is, if the customer receives a payment from Child Support after an exemption has been granted, the amount will be treated as maintenance income, which may result in an overpayment and a reduction in future payments.</p>

<p>If a full exemption is granted, tell the customer that they must also contact Child Support to end the case.</p>

<p><strong>Partial exemptions</strong></p>

<p>Partial exemptions are assessed by social workers and can only be granted for&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
private collect customers who are not receiving their full child support assessment (either ongoing or for a past period due to a retrospective increase in their child support assessment), or</li>
		<li>
customers who have not started a child support case and are able to collect voluntary child support</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Discharging arrears</strong></p>

<p>Discharging arrears from a previous Child Support collect period and ending the Child Support case should also be discussed. Customers who are granted a full exemption (or a partial exemption where Child Support collected previously and child support arrears have accrued) can elect for the Child Support Registrar not to collect any outstanding/unpaid child support arrears, (that is, to discharge the arrears). The exemption allows the customer to discharge the arrears without having them included in the Maintenance Income Test (<strong>MIT</strong>) calculation for FTB purposes.</p>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Backdating exemptions</strong></p>

<p>Grounds for backdating an exemption are established through an assessment of whether the circumstances existed before the date of claim for the entire backdated period. Special circumstances do not need to be established to backdate an exemption to 1 July of the previous financial year. In order to backdate any further however, special circumstances for backdating a maintenance action exemption must first be established.</p>

<p>Backdating an exemption for a customer who was not previously meeting the MAT may result in an arrears payment. In cases where arrears generate and the customer has an existing debt, there must be sufficient grounds for a temporary exclusion from debt offsetting to be approved. When exceptional or unforeseen circumstances apply which may cause the customer to suffer severe financial hardship, customers can request to be temporarily excluded from debt recovery <strong>before</strong> money being taken from their FTB arrears, lump sum or top-up payments. <br>See <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting during family assistance reassessment, reconciliation and claim processing</a>.</p>

<p>When granting an exemption from the MAT for a customer with a child support case in place, contact them to confirm whether they want to end their case (and discharge any arrears).</p>

<p>If the customer wants to end their child support case, refer them to Child Support immediately. Child Support <strong>must</strong> speak with the customer before they can approve the case end.</p>

<p><strong>Exception</strong></p>

<p>In some cases, 2 carers may be entitled to child support for the same child, for example a grandparent and a parent. In these cases, a joint election to end the case is required, that is, both carers must elect to end the case.</p>

<p>If family violence is involved, and ending the case is not an option, it may be appropriate to discuss a partial exemption for the parent carer.</p>

<p>Non-parent carers do not need to meet the MAT, and therefore, do not need to apply for an exemption (such as violence).</p>

<p>The Level 2 Policy Helpdesk can help if policy advice is needed. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Resources</a> for a link.</p>

<p><strong>Request to end child support case</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> important considerations below has information about&#58; shared care, role reversals, assessment end date, child support case not ended, and backdating exemptions, in context with the ending of a child support case.</p>

<p>When a customer advises they wish to end their child support case, refer the customer to Child Support immediately to request the case be ended. See <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?parent-support-team.html">Parent Support Team</a>.</p>

<p>If unable to transfer the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Send an email immediately to Child Support using the 'Maintenance Exemption Notification to Child Support' template on the <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Child_support_e">Resources</a> page. Tell the customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If they are not contacted by Child Support, they should phone Child Support to request the case be ended, (as Child Support cannot backdate the case end)</li>
			<li>
Child Support is still required to confirm, directly with the customer, their intention to end the case</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Child Support will attempt to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact them in the next 2 days on 3 separate occasions, to confirm their intention to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
end their case</li>
			<li>
discharge arrears (if requested)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If these contact attempts are unsuccessful&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Child Support will send the customer a letter asking that they contact Services Australia to confirm if they want to end their child support case</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer may also complete the 'Ending a child support assessment (<a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/forms">CS1671</a>)' form, but Child Support must still speak with the customer before they can approve the case end. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms">Resources</a> for a link to the form.</p>

<p><strong>Important considerations</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shared care</strong></p>

<p>If the care of the children is shared between the parties to a child support case, the payee can elect to end the child support assessments for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any child for whom they are assessed to receive child support from the other parent</li>
		<li>
the child/ren for whom they have more than 65% care (even if the child support entitlement is $0</li>
		<li>
all the children of the case (even if one or more of the children are solely in the other parent's care)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
as long as the annual rate of child support for <strong>both</strong> parties is $0, and</li>
			<li>
the parent has an exemption because of family and domestic violence</li>
			<li>
if there is no exemption, a joint election to end is required</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; they must be advised they may become the payer for the children in the other parent's care.</p>

<p>If ending the case might create more family and domestic violence issues, and the case is private collect, a partial exemption may be considered.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130050-01.html">Effect on Family Tax Benefit (FTB) where the customer elects to suspend or end a child support assessment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Role reversal and exemptions</strong></p>

<p>If an FTB customer is (or would be) the payer, they are considered to have taken reasonable maintenance action, by having the children in their care taken into account in the child support case.</p>

<p>If a domestic violence exemption has been granted for the payee, and the alleged perpetrator’s&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
care of the FTB child/ren increases, or</li>
		<li>
the perpetrator's Adjustable Taxable Income (ATI) decreases, or</li>
		<li>
the payee's ATI increases</li>
		</ul>
<p>The perpetrator may become a potential payee and apply for child support, (and they are entitled to do so).</p>

<p>The Level 2 Policy Helpdesk can assist if policy advice is needed. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms">Resources</a> page has a link.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment end date</strong></p>

<p>Effective from 21 September 2015, customers can only elect to end the assessment from a specified date, which is <strong>after</strong> the date the election is made (that is, a future date). Referring the customer immediately to Child Support makes sure the case is ended from the earliest possible date.</p>

<p>If the customer has had no contact with Child Support, because (for example)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Centrelink have been unable to transfer the customer to Child Support</li>
		<li>
Child Support have been unable to make contact with the customer, or</li>
		<li>
The customer does not initiate contact with Child Support</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer has not confirmed their 'end case' request. The case will therefore remain active until the customer makes contact with Child Support to end their child support assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Child support case not ended</strong></p>

<p>If the child support case is <strong>not</strong> ended and is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Private collect</strong> - the customer's child support assessment will continue to be used in the MIT and impact the rate of FTB. It may be more appropriate to grant a partial exemption if the customer does not want to end the child support case, but is not able to collect the full assessed amount</li>
		<li>
<strong>Child Support collect</strong> - Child Support will continue to attempt to collect child support for the customer (including any arrears that have accrued). Any amount collected will be assessed under the MIT and may impact their rate of FTB. This could cause ongoing issues for customers granted certain exemptions, for example family and domestic violence exemptions</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Backdating of exemption</strong></p>

<p>Backdating an exemption for a customer who was not previously meeting the MAT may result in an arrears payment. In cases where arrears are generated and the customer has an existing debt, there must be sufficient grounds for a temporary exclusion from debt offsetting to be approved. When exceptional or unforeseen circumstances apply which may cause the customer to suffer severe financial hardship, customers can request to be temporarily excluded from debt recovery <strong>before</strong> money being taken from their FTB arrears, lump sum or top-up payments. <br>See <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting during family assistance reassessment, reconciliation and claim processing</a>.</p>

<p>Does the exemption need to be backdated due to family and domestic violence?</p>

<p><strong>No Maintenance Action (NMA) customer</strong></p>

<p>Backdating an exemption for a customer who was not previously meeting the MAT may result in an arrears payment.</p>

<p>In cases where arrears are generated and the customer has an existing debt, there must be sufficient grounds for a temporary exclusion from debt offsetting to be approved. When exceptional or unforeseen circumstances apply which may cause the customer to suffer severe financial hardship, customers can request to be temporarily excluded from debt recovery <strong>before</strong> money being taken from their FTB arrears, lump sum or top-up payments. <br>See <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">Debt offsetting during family assistance reassessment, reconciliation and claim processing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support collect customer</strong> ends their case and has arrears of child support owing&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer can elect to discharge the arrears, that is, the customer is advising Child Support that they will collect the arrears themselves. Ordinarily, this amount would be assessable under the Maintenance Income Test (<strong>MIT</strong>) for FTB purposes. However if the customer has an exemption in place, the 'discharged' arrears will not be assessed under the MIT</li>
		<li>
customers can no longer ask Child Support to backdate the case end to align with the exemption start date, instead they can elect to discharge any outstanding arrears. Due to the exemption, discharged arrears will not be assessed under the MIT. This effectively means that there is <strong>no need to backdate exemptions in these cases</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is granted a full exemption and has arrears accrued for a previous Child Support collect period and the customer elects not to 'discharge' the arrears, it may indicate that an exemption is not appropriate. If the customer elects to collect the arrears they will be assessable under the MIT.</p>

<p><strong>Private collect customer</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a customer has a private collect child support case and there are family and domestic violence circumstances present, it may be appropriate to backdate an exemption. The backdating of the exemption is to offset the effect of child support that the customer was deemed to have received, but may not have received due to the circumstances. This allows Centrelink to reassess their FTB entitlement based on the actual amount of child support they received during this period</li>
		<li>
If the customer is granted a full exemption from a date in the past, additional coding is required by Centrelink to remove the uncollected child support from the MIT. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51030010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Recording_priva_Step01">Recording private maintenance income on Centrelink systems</a> for details on applying the MIT correctly in these cases. If the customer is eligible for arrears, they will be paid <strong>after</strong> the end of the relevant financial year/s, when reconciliation occurs</li>
		<li>
Customers must be advised that if they do not hear from Child Support within 2 days of having their exemption granted, they must contact Child Support directly. The customer must advise they have been granted an exemption and ask for the case to be ended</li>		</ul>

Send a free text (<a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-14010060-01.html">Q888</a>) letter to the customer to confirm/advise the decision and the need to take action to obtain child support. The customer must always be notified in writing of the decision to deny the exemption. The <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-14010060-01.html">Q888</a> must be sent on the same day that <strong>MXD</strong> is coded. This will make sure that the customer is aware of the need to take action to obtain child support if they have not already done so and provides notification that their rate of FTB Part A will reduce after 14 days if action to obtain child support is not taken for the relevant child/ren.

After 14 days the system will automatically update the MAT code to '<strong>NMA</strong>' (no maintenance action), unless the child is still in a 13 week DMA period or the customer already has an active case. The customer will also receive a letter about the change in FTB rate if they revert to NMA</li>

<p>The social worker will decide whether a review of an exemption will be required to check that an exemption is still appropriate for the customer.</p>

<p><strong>IVF exemption</strong>&#58; From 1 July 2009, same-sex couples are recognised as parents. An existing IVF exemption must be reviewed, as it may no longer be applicable. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070040-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and child support for children born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement or via artificial conception procedure (including children of same-sex couples)</a>.</p>

<p>A social worker has discretion in determining when to schedule a future review of a <strong>fear of violence exemption (VIO). </strong>If a social worker deems a future review of an exemption is appropriate, they record the review recommendation in a <strong>DOC</strong> and a Service Officer manually records the review using the Review Registration (<strong>RVR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>From March 2017, VIO exemptions do not trigger an automatic annual review, as this is not a mandatory policy requirement. This is because Social Workers have the discretion to determine the length of the review period dependent upon the circumstances of a particular case.</p>

<p>When creating the review activity, the Service Officer needs to record the following information on the <strong>RVR</strong> screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Service Reason&#58; CSS</li>
		<li>
Review Reason&#58; Manual review</li>
		<li>
Due date&#58; determined by the assessing social worker</li>
		<li>
Text&#58; Review required of VIO exemption. See <strong>DOC</strong> dated xx/xx/xx</li>
		<li>
Keywords&#58; SWO and VIO</li>
		</ul>
<p>A National layer Work Load Manager (WLM) work item will create when the review is due for action.</p>

<p>A Service Officer may also identify when speaking to a customer that a review of a child support exemption is required. In these cases, the Service Officer would refer the customer to a social worker via the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Refer_a_custome_Step07">Social Worker Referral Guided Procedure</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
<strong>without the need to schedule a future manual review date</strong>, no more action is needed, or</li>

<p>If the customer is concerned about how the other parent might respond to a child support application, also consult with a social worker.</p>

<p>If no social work contact is required, the customer will need to apply for a child support assessment. Tell the customer that if they require another exemption they will need to reapply. <strong>DOC</strong> the customer’s record with the customer’s request to end an exemption.</p>
