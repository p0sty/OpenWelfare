<p>The ERR which can be viewed in Cuba, identifies employers with unreconciled pay dates where deduction payments have or have not been received.</p>

<p>To ensure the ERR is accurate, <strong>only</strong> view it in Cuba.</p>

<p>The monthly ERR report is automatically created except for online employers on the first day of every month for all employers with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
linked customers, and</li>
		<li>
pay dates in the previous month</li>
		</ul>
<p>The report is updated daily as employers are reconciled for the current month.</p>

<p>View the report in the Unreconciled Employers window. Unreconciled pay dates on the ERR, with or without payments will display with a status of either <strong>SAVE</strong> or <strong>INIT</strong>.</p>

<p>The Employer Account Summary window displays&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the Employer and CSRN</li>
		<li>
the pay dates left to reconcile</li>
		<li>
unallocated payments on the employer account.<br>Some of these payments may be for future months</li>

		<li>
outstanding account issues that need manual intervention such as top up and excess cash</li>
		<li>
any unreconciled ERRs and the status of the ERR window</li>

<p>A new ERR can be created manually by selecting <strong>New</strong> in the Reconciliation Report List window. This must only occur when&#58;</p>

creating a s72a report when topping up the linked paying parent report - See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010720-01.html">Reconcile section 72A payments (from manual and non STP employers) Cuba Process Help</a></li>

<p>If the employer has deducted from the employees’ wages but the payment has not been received (including on an associated account), and a valid notice is in place, funds from consolidated revenue may be applied to the employer account where satisfied that the deduction has been made. This is known as top up and, if used, is applied as part of the EW reconciliation process.</p>

<p>Top up is automatically applied to ERRs by Cuba from the Tuesday night prior to the 2nd Wednesday of the month until the end of the month when all of the following conditions are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the ERR is at <strong>INIT</strong> status</li>
		<li>

		<li>
if the employer is a parent company and they remit payments for other employers (subsidiary companies) top up must <strong>not</strong> be used for reconciliation of the subsidiary company.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Check documentation in the Reconciliation Report Summary window before allocating excess or unallocated cash to an ERR, to confirm the purpose of the payment. Where documentation is not present investigate previous reconciliations to ensure the account has been reconciled correctly before contacting the employer to seek clarification.</p>

<p>Top up can be used from the second Wednesday of each month where the employer advises they have made the deductions but payments have not been received and a valid Section 45 notice is in place.</p>

<p>Document the decision using the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04170000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Templates01">Reconciliation template</a>, to apply top up on the relevant months ERR in the Employer Account Summary window and ERR window in all circumstances where manual top up is applied. </p>

written - document the date and type (fax, post or email)</li>
		<li>
verbal - document the name and role of the person who provided the information</li>

<p>When satisfied that the deductions have been made reconcile update the ERR to the actual deduction amount expected, and manually apply top up.</p>
