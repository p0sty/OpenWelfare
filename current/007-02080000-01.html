<p>This document outlines information for Service Officers to decide if FTB, CCS and/or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments (Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)) are payable while a customer and/or their child are overseas and for how long.

<p>FTB, CCS, PPL and DAP are not payable to customers who cease to reside in Australia.</p>

<p>If a customer leaves Australia to live in another country, their family assistance will cancel from the date of departure (cancellation reason&#58; NRQ - Not Residentially Qualified). If a child leaves Australia to live in another country, family assistance for that child will stop from the date of departure.</p>

<p>There are no portability limits for CCS children. If a CCS child leaves Australia to live in another country, CCS will not stop for a portability reason. However, as CCS can only be paid for child care provided in Australia, it would usually cancel after 26 weeks. This is because the child has ceased to attend an approved child care service in Australia.</p>

<p>If the customer’s payment is not portable for any reason, consider if the partner is qualified and can claim the payment.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Temporary_absen">Temporary absence overseas</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An <strong>absence is considered to be temporary</strong> if the customer continues to reside in Australia. A customer leaving Australia temporarily will generally continue to be entitled to FTB, CCS, and PPL/DAP payments for up to the maximum portability period, from the original date of departure from Australia, provided they are not return rule affected.</p>

<p>For original date of departure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB (both Part A and Part B) can generally continue for up to 6 weeks of a temporary absence of the customer and/or their child. At the end of this period FTB will cancel</li>
		<li>
CCS can generally continue if entitlement exists for the first 6 weeks of an absence for the customer. At the end of this period CCS entitlement will stop being paid (CCS remains current, but entitlement will be nil)</li>
		<li>
PPL/DAP can generally be paid to Australian residents, if entitlement exists, for up to 56 weeks of a temporary absence There are no portability rules for PPL or DAP children. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> DAP is not payable for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023. Fathers and partners will need to claim PPL</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some customers can only be paid under approved absence rules. See <a href="../families/007-02080000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Approved_absenc">Approved absences for certain temporary visa holders</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer or child is unable to return at the end of their maximum portability period, Services Australia has the <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01050000-01.html">discretion to extend the portability period</a> under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Any days a child is absent whilst overseas counts towards their eligible 42 allowable absence days. Customers will be liable for full fees where the absence is an unapproved absence or a disregarded absence.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a CCS child has 14 continuous weeks of non-attendance at child care, their enrolment is automatically ceased. In these cases, a reassessment will occur. This will review the last day the child actually attended care, and the customer will not be eligible for any absent days after that day to the end of the enrolment. Any absent days the customer is no longer entitled will be recovered from the child care service, who in turn may pass this on the customer. For more information see <a href="../families/007-17103134-01.html">Absences for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS)</a> and <a href="../families/007-17103117-01.html">Enrolment requirements for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If a customer is receiving PPL or DAP</strong> while they are overseas, their&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PPL period will cancel when their absence exceeds 56 weeks, even if they have not received the maximum amount</li>
		<li>
DAP will cancel when their absence exceeds 56 weeks, even if they have not received the maximum DAP period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the 56 week portability period starts from the date the customer leaves Australia regardless of whether they have a child in their care or are in receipt of family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments at that time. Return rules can impact the start date of the 56 week period. The <a href="../families/007-02080000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a table providing information about FTB and CCS portability periods and the effects on FTB and CCS rates and PPL rules.</p>

<p><strong>FTB </strong>- A person or child who is absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks, who returns to Australia and leaves Australia again less than 6 weeks later, is deemed not to have returned to Australia. If a customer or their child leaves Australia temporarily within 6 weeks of their last return to Australia and the previous absence was longer than 6 weeks, their FTB will cancel as soon as they leave Australia again. </p>

<p><strong>CCS</strong> - If a customer leaves Australia temporarily within 6 weeks of their last return to Australia and the previous absence was longer than 6 weeks, their CCS entitlement will stop when they leave Australia again. Return rules do not apply to CCS children. There are no portability limits for CCS children.</p>

<p>These return rules do not impact the customer's entitlement to FTB and/or CCS while they, or their child/ren, are physically in Australia between overseas trips.</p>

<p>Multiple trips can be an indication that the customer and or child is no longer residing in Australia. A customer is no longer eligible for FTB, CCS, PPL or DAP if they cease to reside in Australia.</p>

<p>If the customer’s payment is not portable for any reason, consider if the partner is qualified and can claim the payment.</p>

<p>These customers may request a letter stating when their entitlement ceases (and the date from which the FTB reduction in rate occurred). The letter will enable the relevant Department of Defence HR department to calculate the shortfall and pay any lost entitlement if applicable. The information can be provided via a Q999 letter or the standard letter for any customer travelling overseas (XOB101 portability script letter). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the portability script cannot be run for a CCS only departure, so the XOB101 needs to be done manually.</p>

<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a Centrelink customer or child leaves or returns to Australia through the Immigration Datalink. When the datalink advises of departure/return information, the portability of the payment is automatically assessed by the system, regardless of whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled.</p>

<p>Services Australia uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Immigration Datalink I. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. Staff should consider applying the alternative dates if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>In many cases, customers do <strong>not</strong> need to advise when they are leaving Australia temporarily, or have returned from a temporary absence.</p>

<p>However, there are situations where customers should advise of a departure prior to leaving Australia or contact when they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> In most cases, customers can notify of their departure from Australia via the <a href="../self-service/133-04150030-01.html">Travelling outside of Australia service</a> within their Centrelink online account. Where a customer's circumstances are more complex they will be prompted to contact the agency.</p>
