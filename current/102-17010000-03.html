<p>All job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must enter into a Job Plan with either Services Australia or an Employment Services Provider (if provider managed).</p>

<p>Once the job seeker has been advised that they are required to enter into a Job Plan they must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
enter into a Job Plan at the first available opportunity</li>
		<li>
take reasonable steps to comply with the terms of the Job Plan while it is in force</li>
		<li>
be prepared to enter into another Job Plan instead of the existing one if required</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120000-01.html">a temporary exemption from mutual obligation requirements</a> may be appropriate, depending on the job seeker's circumstances. Some exemptions apply only to principal carers.</p>

<p>Job seekers who live in a designated remote area are referred to a <a href="../job-seekers/001-02140000-01.html">Community Development Program (CDP) provider</a>. These job seekers are required to complete a Job Plan with their Remote Jobs and Communities Programme (RJCP) Provider.</p>

<p>The activities included in the Job Plan must be reasonable, measurable and achievable by the job seeker.</p>

<p>Mutual obligation requirements must not place at risk either the welfare of the job seeker's children or the job seeker's own health or well-being.</p>

<p>In the majority of instances, Service Officers will be negotiating Job Plans for Centrelink managed job seekers. For principal carers, this will primarily be for job seekers who can fully meet their mutual obligation requirements by participating in work, self-employment, study or a combination of these activities.</p>

<p>If a principal carer is no longer able to fully meet their requirements, they should be immediately registered and referred to an Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>In general terms, the following issues should be considered when negotiating a Job Plan&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker's individual circumstances, in particular their assessed work capacity (where relevant), their capacity to comply with the requirements and their personal needs</li>
		<li>
the job seeker's education, experience, skills and age</li>
		<li>
the impact of any disability, illness, mental condition or physical condition of the person on the person's ability to work, to look for work or to participate in activities</li>
		<li>
the state of the local labour market and the transport options available to the person in accessing that market</li>
		<li>
the participation opportunities available to the person</li>
		<li>
the family and caring responsibilities of the person (including availability of child care)</li>
		<li>
the length of travel time required to comply with the requirements (90 minutes each way or 60 minutes if the job seeker is a principal carer parent or has a partial capacity to work (PCW))</li>
		<li>
the financial costs (such as travel costs) of complying with the requirements, and the person's capacity to pay for such costs</li>
		<li>
any other matters that the Provider considers relevant in the circumstances (including if they disclose that they are a victim of family and domestic violence)</li>
		<li>
if the job seeker has any vulnerabilities or vulnerability indicators (as identified by Services Australia) such as homelessness, psychiatric problems or mental illness, severe drug or alcohol dependency, traumatic relationship breakdown, etc</li>
		<li>
any history of the job seeker not complying with their mutual obligation requirements</li>		</ul>

Parenting Payment Single (PPS) job seekers from the date their <strong>youngest</strong> dependent child turns 6 years. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> single job seekers cease to qualify for PP once their youngest child turns 14 years of age; Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) job seekers cease to qualify for PP once their youngest child turns 6 years of age; so they are not subject to compulsory mutual obligation requirements</li>

Principal carers receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) job seeker or Special Benefit (SpB), regardless of the age of their youngest child. However, principal carers in receipt of SpB who have a youngest dependent child under 6 years can be granted an exemption from their mutual obligation requirement. Service Officers should advise job seekers about possible entitlement to PP if their youngest child is under 6 for partnered principal carer, under 14 if single</li>

<p>Principal carers who are meeting their mutual obligation requirements in full through the activities listed below are <strong>not required</strong> to be connected with an Employment Services Provider but may choose to volunteer for services. The activities are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
sufficient work, including self-employment</li>
		<li>
approved study</li>
		<li>
or a combination of these activities</li>
		</ul>
<p>Principal carers should be informed of available services and offered the opportunity to volunteer if they wish.</p>

they can apply for Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)</li>
		<li>
if approved, the PES approval letter/ documentation should be taken to the Employment Services Provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the study is approved as a short course by the provider to fully meet the mutual obligation requirements (that is the course is <strong>30 hours or more</strong> per fortnight), Services Australia will receive the study approval information via automatic update and the job seeker's Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen will display&#58;</p>

continue to be treated as a job seeker</li>

		<ul>		<li>
Advise the job seeker to provide relevant evidence of the activity at the income support finalisation interview</li>
		<li>
At the income support finalisation interview, ensure the relevant evidence is provided. The Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen must be coded to record any approved activity the job seeker is undertaking (for example, '<strong>PTW</strong>' where working at least 15 hours per week, or '<strong>PFT</strong>' where Parenting job seeker is doing approved study). If the job seeker is Centrelink managed, then negotiate the Job Plan. The <strong>AEX</strong> screen must have an end date of no longer than 12 months duration</li>

<p>Principal carer job seekers, who are engaged in self-employment, will be able to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements if they are working in the business for at least 30 hours per fortnight and their net business income is equivalent to at least 30 hours per fortnight at the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010100-01.html">national minimum wage</a>.</p>

<p>The situation may arise where the job seeker has a viable and ongoing business; however it is operating at a loss or below the national minimum wage due to significant tax deductions. In these circumstances, the income must be assessed as not meeting the job seeker's mutual obligation requirements of 30 hours per fortnight, when calculated against the national minimum wage. The job seeker has not met their mutual obligation requirements and they cannot fully meet their mutual obligation requirements. They must be referred to an Employment Services Provider who is responsible for determining appropriate activities to include in a Job Plan. This would normally be job search.</p>

<p>Any gross income and allowable deductions that relate to the business must be taken into account when assessing business income. The processes surrounding the treatment of self-employment have not changed and should not be altered for the purposes of mutual obligation requirements. See&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> income provided by a partner to a member of a couple who is in receipt of a social security payment, <strong>does not</strong> meet the definition of income under section 8(8) of the Social Security Act (1991). For example, a principal carer being paid by their current partner to provide child care to just their own children would not be regarded as meeting requirements. However, a principal carer who engages in a viable family day care business and cares for other children in addition to their own, may have this activity assessed for meeting mutual obligation requirements.</p>
