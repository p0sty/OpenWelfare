<p>Most PPL customers must meet the work test&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work for a period spanning 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) within the 392 day work test period (approximately 13 months), and</li>
		<li>
had no more than a break of 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) between 2 qualifying work days in the 295 day (approximately 10 months) qualifying period</li>
		</ul>
<p>For children born or entered care<strong> before 1 July 2023</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>This includes primary and secondary claimants. In exceptional circumstances for PPL, secondary and tertiary claimants will not be required to meet the work test.</p>

<p>All Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) customers must meet the work test to be eligible.</p>

<p>For children born or entered care <strong>on or after 1 July 2023&#58;</strong></p>

<p>This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a PPL claimant in normal circumstances, and</li>
		<li>
PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>A special claimant in exceptional circumstances may not need to meet the work test. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in most cases, a PPL claimant in normal circumstances (who is not the birth mother) is required to meet the work test and so is the birth mother. Exception to this is adoptive parents, where they are assessed on their work test eligibility only. </p>

<p>If a birth mother claimant in normal circumstances has claimed first and this claim has been assessed. Then the subsequent PPL claimants work test only, is to be assessed, as the birth mothers work test was reviewed previously.</p>

<p>JobKeeper Payment and COVID-19 Disaster Payment (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021 count towards the work test for PPL and DAP. This includes where the customer was stood down and had not physically attended work.</p>

<p>Service Officers must not issue a written request for evidence of family and domestic violence.</p>

<p>Service Officers assessing PPL claims must review the work test and employment information provided in the claim. Service Officers may confirm the work test using previously recorded information on the customer's record. This includes payments received and reported income as well as scanned documents previously supplied by the customer.</p>

<p>Service Officers who are not satisfied the work test has been met based on the information provided and any other information available on the customer's record, for example EANS, FIPY, may request evidence to support the work test.</p>

<p>For PPL claims for children born <strong>on or after 1 July 2023</strong>, if a birth mother or an adoptive parent claims, they only need to meet the work test (or satisfy an exception). If any other claimant type claims PPL in normal circumstances, e.g. biological father or partner of birth mother, they need to meet the work test and so does birth mother. Evidence of meeting the work test may be requested for either the birth mother or other claimant or both.</p>

<p>Although Service Officers are able to request evidence if they are not satisfied the work test has been met, <strong>the following situations alone do not mean the customer has not met the work test</strong>, the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has not worked with their current employer for the entire work test period</li>
		<li>
has been on income support for some or all of the work test period and not declared employment income</li>
		<li>
has had a second/subsequent child close together and not returned to work in between (as any paid leave and previous PPL periods will count as work)</li>

is self-employed and their business does not make a profit</li>		</ul>

<p>Current or continuing employment is not a requirement of the work test. A customer may not be currently employed or may be planning to resign from their employment at the time they lodge their claim, and can still meet the work test based on their employment during the qualifying period.</p>

<p>If some of the qualifying period is in the future, consider whether evidence to support the work test is required.</p>

<p>A scholarship provided by an institution to enable a person to conduct their research/studies to attain a degree will <strong>not</strong> count towards the PPL work test.

what the severe medical condition was</li>

who experienced the severe medical condition</li>

the period the customer was affected by the severe medical condition, or the period they were required to care for their family member with the severe medical condition, and</li>

		</ul>
<p>When assessing the medical evidence a Service Officer needs to consider if the medical condition&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
would have prevented the customer from performing paid work. Consider the severity of the condition as well as the nature of the person’s job</li>

of their family member and the level of care they required would have prevented the customer from performing paid work. Consider the severity of the condition as well as the level of care required</li>

that the customer would have worked during the work test period if&#58;</li>

they were not affected by the severe medical condition, or</li>

<p>Self-employed customers can provide documents from the following list to show their intention to work during the work test period&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
existing and new contracts</li>

		<li>
employment of a staff member to perform their usual work activities</li>
		<li>
self-declaration of self-employment status and the intention for the business to continue</li>
		</ul>
<p>When assessing the employment evidence, Service Officers need to be satisfied the person would have met the work test if the medical condition had not existed. The evidence needs to show that the customer would have met the work test requirements had they worked during the exception period, taking in to account their usual hours and pattern of work.</p>

<p>A customer must have a genuine connection to the workforce. In most cases, this cannot be demonstrated if the customer has not performed any qualifying work in their work test period. If a customer has not performed any qualifying work in their work test period, Service Officers need to consider if the customer has a genuine ongoing connection to the workforce. Consider a customer’s work history, leave and whether they intend to return to employment with employer.</p>

<p>When a customer advises they were required to stop working in a dangerous job they will need to provide evidence.</p>

<p>The customer will need to provide proof of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the type of work they were performing <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
evidence that this work was a risk to the customer's pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence of work</strong></p>

<p>Proof from the customer's employer that before the child was born the customer worked in a particular job. This can include a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
letter from employer</li>
		<li>
copy of contract/workplace agreement</li>
		<li>
customer statutory declaration of job description (self-employed only)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence of risk</strong></p>

<p>Evidence confirming that the customer stopped working because of the hazards connected with the work was a risk to the customer's pregnancy. This can include a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
medical certificate</li>
		<li>
letter from employer (if they are a medical professional)</li>
		<li>
a copy of their industry regulations or guidelines that confirm they were unable to continue working due to their pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Assessing Dangerous Job Evidence</strong></p>

<p>Service Officers are to assess the evidence provided is sufficient to show the customer worked in a dangerous job before their child was born <strong>and</strong> they stopped working due to the risks the job posed to the pregnancy.</p>

<p>Acceptable evidence must include the following&#58;</p>

<p><strong>For employees</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
the type of work the customer performed, including their job description</li>
		<li>
the date the customer stopped working</li>
		<li>
the hazards connected to the kind of work that prevented the customer from continuing to work</li>
		<li>
the job was a risk to the customer's pregnancy and the customer was unable to continue working at their current employment. This may include current industry regulations or an employment agreement/contract</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For self-employed customers</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
a copy of the customer's contract or industry regulations, and</li>
		<li>
a statutory declaration stating&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the type of work the customer performed, including their job description</li>
			<li>
the date the customer stopped working</li>
			<li>
the hazards connected to the kind of work that prevented the customer from continuing work</li>
			<li>
that the job was a risk to the customer's pregnancy and the customer was unable to continue working in their current employment. This may include current industry regulations or a current contract</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>There may be some circumstances where evidence from an employer could be enough to satisfy proof of risk to the pregnancy and medical evidence would not be required. For example current industry regulations, an employment agreement or current contract that show regulations not allowing a pregnant person to work past a certain period of gestation due to workplace risks.</p>

<p>If a customer has not lodged medical evidence and the employment evidence is <strong>not </strong>sufficient to conclude that the work performed and its hazards were a risk to the pregnancy, then further evidence should be requested for example, medical evidence.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-05020030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains examples for Service Officers of what can be used as suitable evidence and dangerous job scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence on file</strong></p>

<p>Evidence provided as part of the customer's claim are available via '<strong>Document-tools</strong>' for any information/evidence that has been provided as part of the customer's online claim.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence of Dangerous Job - risk COVID-19 has on pregnancy</strong></p>

<p>If a PPL customer stops working due to the risk that COVID-19 has on their pregnancy, they may be assessed under the Dangerous Job provision. In these cases, the customer must provide proof of their work circumstances from their employer <strong>and</strong> evidence supporting the risk to their pregnancy from a medical professional.</p>

<p>In these cases, the customer must provide medical evidence. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a letter from a medical professional recommending the customer stop work due to the risk of COVID-19 to their pregnancy, or</li>
		<li>
a directive from the State or Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care advising a pregnant person in certain industries should cease work because of the risk to their pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer must also provide evidence from their employer that states&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the type of work they were doing, including a description of the job (a statutory declaration of their job description, if they are self-employed)</li>
		<li>
the date they stopped working</li>
		<li>
that they would have kept working if not for the risk of COVID-19 to their pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence of Dangerous Job - cannot receive COVID-19 vaccine due to risks to the pregnancy</strong></p>

<p>If a PPL customer is working in a job and their employer has a requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to continue working, the PPL customer may be able to access the dangerous job provision if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
were pregnant before they had to stop working, and</li>
		<li>
received medical advice that being vaccinated against COVID-19 would pose a risk to their pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, the customer must provide medical evidence. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a letter from a medical professional confirming the customer cannot receive the COVID-19 vaccination as it poses a risk to the pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer must also provide evidence from their employer that states&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all employees are required to be vaccinated to continue to work, and</li>
		<li>
the customer would have kept working if not for their inability to be vaccinated</li>
		</ul>
