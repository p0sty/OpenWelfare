<p>When a person contacts to advise of the death of a customer, staff must offer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the notifier the services of a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12000000-01.html">social worker</a> in the first instance or at any time the notifier becomes or shows signs of distress during the contact </li>
		<li>
the pamphlet <a href="../bereavement/099-02020040-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Publications">Needing help after someone has died? (HD001)</a> and if accepted, issue to the person if at a service centre, otherwise refer them to 'Death of a loved one' on the Service Australia website</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following cultural issues must be respected and considered by Service Officers when being advised of the death of an <strong>Indigenous</strong> customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In some cases, immediate family members cannot mention the name of the deceased person. This means immediate family members may have to ask other relatives/friends to call on their behalf or attend the interview with the notifier </li>
		<li>
In this situation, it may also be offensive to the person for the Service Officer to say the name of the deceased customer. If unsure, sensitively ask the person if it is all right for them to use the deceased customer's name. If the person is not comfortable with this, avoid using the deceased customer's name wherever possible. See <a href="../bereavement/099-01040000-01.html">Cultural considerations when someone dies</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Does customer's record indicate that they were income managed, as shown by <strong>INM</strong> on the benefit status line?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, follow procedure to update record for <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01060010-01.html">death of an income managed customer</a>. Return to this procedure and <a href="../bereavement/099-02020040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Advice_of_death_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> get as much information as possible during the initial contact to reduce the need for future contact with the deceased person's partner or family during this stressful time.</p>

<p>To confirm the death, the notifier must at least give the full name and date of death of the deceased adult plus at least 2 of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deceased adult's last address in full</li>
		<li>
date of birth</li>

Customer Reference Number (CRN), or</li>

partner's name</li>

<p>The notifier must also give their name, address, phone number and relationship to the deceased.</p>

<p>Check the correct customer's record has been selected before taking steps to record the death. For example, do not record the death on the deceased customer's partner or parent's record. Performing a death action on the wrong record causes unnecessary grief and stress to the deceased person's family.</p>

<p>Run the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure to code the death action.</p>

<p>If the guided procedure is not available, manually code the death action.</p>

<p>When recording a death the <strong>Notification Handler (NOHL) is incorrectly using the date of notification </strong>as the date to increase the survivor's rate to the single rate. The workaround for this is to record the date of receipt (DOR) as the later of either the date of death (DOD) or date paid to + 1 (DPT + 1).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the workaround auto-applies if the <strong>Notification of death</strong> guided procedure is used.</p>

<p>Before finalising the death action activity, check the auto-generated Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP) amount on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen. If it appears to be correct, a manual calculation is <strong>not</strong> needed. Only if a manual calculation is needed, see <a href="../bereavement/099-06020000-01.html">Calculation of a Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP)</a>.</p>

<p>The deceased person's pension is cancelled from the later of the date of death (DOD) or date paid to + 1 day (DPT + 1).</p>

<p>If the surviving partner was a joint owner of any assets with their late partner, full ownership of the assets legally transfers to the surviving partner following the death of their partner. However, for social security purposes, if assets are owned in joint names with the deceased partner, the surviving partner is only assessed as owning 50%. The system will continue to assess that the surviving partner owns 50% of the asset, until the surviving partner advises of the transfer of assets.</p>

<p>During the death action, if the system displays the warning 'WC - Change prior to Limiting Date - Update WC balance'&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-03.html">Working Credit Balance Summary (WCBS) screen</a>, and</li>

<p>After the death action has been recorded, the system will auto-switch to the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen of the surviving partner's record and show&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the surviving partner's rate that will auto-update to the single rate, or maintained at the single rate for a surviving partner who was separated due to ill health. The rate is based on the surviving partner's income and assets. The rate is varied from date paid to + 1 day (DPT + 1) or date of death (DOD), whichever is the later</li>
		<li>
an auto-calculated <a href="../bereavement/099-06000000-01.html">Lump Sum Bereavement Payment (LBP)</a> if the partner is eligible. For example, the single rate is less than the combined member of a couple rate</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the surviving partner starts work, or is currently working, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">working credits</a> may enable them to keep some of their <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">income support payment while they are working</a>.</p>

<p>If their income reduces <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">their fortnightly rate to nil and some of that income is employment income</a>, they may remain current at nil rate for up to 6 fortnights and retain certain benefits.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the person's deceased partner was working and had any working credits, these credits cannot be transferred to them.</p>

<p>If the surviving partner is granted a reversionary income stream, assess from the date it is first <strong>entitled to be received</strong>. A lump sum arrears payment received by the reversionary beneficiary, accrued between the death of the primary beneficiary and when the reversionary beneficiary starts to get regular payments, is assessed as income from the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05060010-01.html">income stream</a>. This means the income is assessed over the period to which it relates. Effective from 9 May 2018, if bereavement provisions apply and the assessment of lump sum arrears result in a debt during the bereavement period for the surviving spouse, it can be waived under the legislative instrument ‘Social Security (Waiver of Debts - Bereavement Period) Specification 2017’ made under subsection 1237AB(1) of the Social Security Act 1991<strong>. <br>Note&#58;</strong> any debt incurred after the Act's 14 week bereavement period has ended would not be waived under the provisions of this legislative instrument. The legislative instrument is not retrospective. This means that any of these debts that occur before 9 May 2018 cannot be waived under class of debt waiver provisions</p>

<p>Is the surviving partner receiving Carer Payment (CP) or Carer Allowance (CA)?</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if someone other than the partner (a third party carer) gets CP/CA for the deceased, see <a href="../carers/009-03090010-01.html">Death of a care receiver and the effect on Carer Payment</a>, or <a href="../carers/009-03090060-01.html">Death of an adult care receiver and the effect on Carer Allowance</a>.</p>
