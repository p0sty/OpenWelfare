<strong>No</strong>, the job seeker may need a referral to an Employment Services Provider if they are not already connected. Providers are responsible for negotiating and maintaining the Job Plan for provider managed job seekers. If Centrelink managed, the job seeker either needs to select a complementary activity to supplement the hours (e.g. part-time work or self-employment) or choose another activity to meet their requirements. If voluntary work is not approved, <strong>DOC</strong> the job seeker's record with the reason it was not approved. Ensure the job seeker is verbally told of the decision&#58;</li>
