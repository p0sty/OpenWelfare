<p><strong>STP employer name vs trading name</strong></p>

<p>Customer logs into their Centrelink Express Plus mobile app to report their employment income from Kitty Cat Castles. They are asked to check the pre-filled details for STP employer Betty and Bob Smith Trading Company, ABN 100 4567 891.</p>

<p>The customer doesn’t recognise this employer, but before they answer <strong>No</strong> to working for them, they check their payslip. Their payslip has the employer name of Kitty Cat Castles, but the same ABN of 100 4567 891 and realises that Kitty Cat Castles is the trading name.</p>

<p>The customer confirms the details and merges the STP employer with the existing employer name on their record. They are then presented with pre-filled STP employment income to review.</p>

<p>Customer is presented with a pre-filled amount of $427.65 salary and wages.</p>

<p>The customer knows this amount is correct so doesn’t make any changes and ‘accepts’ the income and continues with their reporting task.</p>

<p><strong>STP service profiling</strong></p>

<p>A notification customer receives a message through MyGov that they are required to report each fortnight prior to delivery of their income support payment.</p>

<p>The customer contacts the agency and advises that they are not working.</p>

<p>The Service Officer knows that a customer’s reporting frequency may be automatically updated when new STP data is reported by an employer. The Service Officer checks the <strong>PQS</strong> screen in Customer First and notices that the Profile Description advises Income. When selecting the Income entry, it advises of STP income.</p>

<p>The Service Officer launches the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct as it is the customer’s reporting due date. The ‘<strong>STP data present</strong>’ indicator is <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>Messages</strong> page of the workflow. Provisional data pre-fills on the STP Employer Update (<strong>EMCF)</strong> screen, including an STP employer’s name and ABN/WPN. The SO advises the customer that an employer has reported employment details for them via STP. The Service Officer shares the name of the employer and asks the customer whether they work or have recently worked for this employer. The Service Officer uses the <a href="https&#58;//abr.business.gov.au/">ABN Lookup</a> website to identify alternative trading names used by the ABN/WPN that the customer may recognise.</p>

<p>If the customer advises that they have not worked for the STP employer, staff can reject the STP employer and complete the report as per normal business processes. Only then, can staff update the customer’s reporting frequency to OFF. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120555-01.html">Reporting screens</a>. Staff must record the decision and details of the conversation.</p>

<p>If STP data is available in subsequent reporting periods, the customer will be placed back on reporting. If the customer rejects an STP employer more than once, they will be profiled for contact by trained staff for an STP Intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Task allowance</strong></p>

<p>Customer is presented with a pre-filled amount of $945.00 salary and wages and $37.50 task allowance. </p>

<p>The customer doesn’t think this is correct as they thought they just get paid $982.50 per fortnight, so checks their payslip. They then see that their pay is made up of 2 components, being the wage of $945 and a first aid allowance of $37.50. </p>

<p>The customer sees that the pre-filled data is actually correct and ‘accepts’ the income.</p>

<p><strong>Compensation payments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Already assessed</strong></p>

<p>Customer is currently paid worker’s compensation of $427.98 from their employer, which has previously been assessed by the Compensation Recovery Team. When the customer goes online to report their partner’s employment income, they are presented with a pre-filled amount of $427.98 salary and wages from their current employer.</p>

<p>The customer adjusts the amount to $0.00 as they do not get paid salary and wages from their employer, advises their partner’s income and completes their report.</p>

<p>The employer shortly after realises they made a mistake by not reporting the payment as paid leave –worker’s compensation.</p>

<p>They correct this by updating the pay details with the ATO via STP. The updates won’t pre-fill to the customer as they have already completed the report.</p>

<p>Once the employer makes the updates and reports the compensation payment correctly in the future, the customer will no longer be presented with pre-filled compensation payment details.</p>

<p><strong>New compensation details</strong></p>

<p>A JSP customer has recently started to be paid workers compensation. When they complete their reporting task through their online account, they see <strong>Paid leave –worker’s compensation</strong> pre-filled. The customer confirms the pre-filled details, noticing it is an assessable amount, and completes their report. They then see they have an online task to provide a <strong>MOD</strong> <strong>C</strong>, which they submit a few days later.</p>

<p>When they do their next report, they confirm the pre-filled worker’s compensation details again, noticing it still shows as an assessable amount, and finalise their report.</p>

<p>On the (3<sup>rd</sup>) following fortnight, they confirm the pre-filled worker’s compensation details again, but this time they notice it now shows as not assessable. The customer checks their online account and can see that their compensation details are now being assessed separately.</p>

<p><strong>Gross vs net</strong></p>

<p>Customer calls the Youth and Students payment line to do their reporting over the phone as they cannot log into their online account. The Service Officer runs the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct where STP data is presented. The Service Officer discusses the pre-filled income of $375.33 salary and wages and $12.00 laundry allowance. </p>

<p>The customer confirms they got paid the $12 laundry allowance but only got paid $350.00 of salary and wages. Before adjusting the amount on behalf of the customer, the Service Officer reminds the customer that that the gross amount needs to be reported. The customer checks their payslip and sees they were reading the nett amount and later confirms both amounts. </p>

<p>The Service Officer ‘accepts’ the income and advises that only the salary and wages component is assessed as the laundry allowance is a reimbursement for out of pocket expenses.</p>

<p>The customer is asked how many days the leave payment covers, or their average weekly wage. The customer advises the leave was for 13 days and ‘accepts’ the income. An IMP is then imposed for 2 weeks and 3 days (13 work days) from 2 June until 20 June.</p>

The Service Officer advises the customer that they must declare the gross income they were paid in their reporting period and explains how the customer can do this when reporting through the app </p>

<p>The customer goes back to their app and edits the pre-filled amount of $600 to $500, to match their payslip and completes their report.</p>

<p><strong>Salary sacrifice</strong></p>

<p>Customer works part-time and gets paid a gross salary of $794.80 per fortnight. The customer has a salary packaging arrangement, where $100 is deducted per fortnight, which goes to superannuation. This arrangement means the customer pays less tax.</p>

<p>When the customer views their pre-filled STP data, they see salary and wages of $794.80 and salary sacrifice of $100. They initially thought the details were incorrect, as the customer felt their ‘taxable’ income to be assessed should be $694.80 per fortnight. They contact Centrelink to discuss the pre-filled data.</p>

<p>After speaking to a Service Officer, they understand that for Centrelink purposes, the salary sacrificed amount is for visibility only, and doesn’t reduce their gross assessable income. The customer confirms the pre-filled income that needs to be declared and reported as $794.80.</p>

<p><strong>Reportable fringe benefits</strong></p>

<p>Customer works in a nursing home where they get paid a part-time salary and laundry allowance each fortnight. They also have a fringe benefit arrangement of $220 per fortnight for a car.</p>

<p>The customer contacts to do their reporting. The pre-filled STP data shows salary and wages $921.17, laundry allowance $7.20 and reportable fringe benefits of $220 (grossed up amount).</p>

<p>The Service Officer asks if the fringe benefits includes free or discounted accommodation. As this is for a car, the customer answers no. If it did include free or discounted accommodation, the customer would be asked the amount, which would then reduce the amount of fringe benefits to be assessed.</p>

<p>The Gross STP Income and Gross Income Reported fields display a total of $1,141.17.</p>

<p>The customer confirms the details are correct, so accept income is selected. A message tells the Service Officer, that “53% of Reportable Fringe Benefits will be calculated and mapped”. </p>

<p>This means that the Service Officer doesn’t need to do any calculations to work out the non-grossed up amount. When selecting <strong>Next</strong> through the workflow, they are taken to EAPP where they can see the 2 assessable income components, $921.17 and $116.60, totalling $1,037.77.</p>

The customer realises that their employer wouldn’t have run the pays for this week yet so manually adds the missing pay details by selecting ‘Add pay’.

<p><strong>Incorrect employer name</strong></p>

<p>Customer has contacted to advise that the STP income that pre-fills when reporting is correct, but it is from the wrong employer. The customer advises they have just started working at Coles, but used to work at Woolworths last year.</p>

<p>The Service Officer views the customer’s details in Process Direct and notices that on <strong>EMCF</strong>, the <strong>STP Employer Name</strong> says Coles Supermarket but the <strong>Linked Employer</strong> is Woolworths Supermarket. This would have occurred at the time when confirming the pre-filled STP employer but selecting the wrong employer name to link from existing <strong>EANS</strong> details.</p>

<p>The Service Officer runs the <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow from Process Direct, selects <strong>Edit</strong> for the employer that needs updating, selects <strong>Rejected</strong> from the <strong>Status</strong> drop down options and then <strong>Save</strong>. The Service Officer then selects <strong>Assess</strong> and finalises the activity.</p>

<p>Once completed, the Service Officer runs the <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow again and this time selects <strong>Confirmed</strong> from the <strong>Status</strong> drop down options. They then select the <strong>Employer</strong> field for linking and as Coles isn’t an existing employer on <strong>EANS</strong>, the Service Officer selects <strong>New Employer</strong>, then <strong>Save</strong>. </p>

<p>The Service Officer notices that the STP employment income details from last fortnight’s report had mapped under Woolworths on <strong>EAPP</strong>, so they follow current BAU processes to replicate the coding under the right employer name of Coles. They then finalise their updates.</p>

<p>The Service Officer explains to the customer that when they next report, they will see their employment income pre-fill with the correct STP employer name.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of cessation payments being paid to an employee who is still employed</strong></p>

<p>Some employers may report <strong>Unused leave on termination</strong> paid to an employee with no cessation date or reason. This may occur in the following scenarios&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Transition to Phase 2 PayEvent 2020 data (PE2020)</strong></p>

<p>Where an employment relationship terminates before the employer transitions to PayEvent 2020 data, it is possible that after they transition to PayEvent 2020 the employer may still make a payment of unused leave to the individual. This may result in the cessation date and reason being unavailable in the payroll system, as the termination occurred before the transition, during phase 1. Unused leave and termination payments will update to <strong>IMP</strong>. An SU1/letter from employer will be required for payments subject to mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Employment status changes from permanent to casual</strong></p>

<p>An employee may change from a permanent employment status (full time or part time) to casual. When paid, the employee's remaining entitlements are correctly classified in STP as unused leave on termination. However, as the person remains a casual employee of the same employer the payment is assessed as a lump sum and coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010100-01.html">Leave and termination payments paid by an employer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Reinstatement</strong></p>

<p>An employee may leave their employment, be paid their entitlements, and later be reinstated. This can occur in wrongful termination situations and the effect of the reinstatement is that the cessation is taken to have never occurred. The instruction for employers is to remove the cessation date. However, the reinstatement does not change the fact a payment for unused leave was made, and so it must remain in the STP reporting. The STP reporting will, as a result, show amounts present as <strong>Unused Leave on Termination</strong> without a cessation date or reason. If the customer advises they are still working for that employer, the payment is assessed as a lump sum and coded on <strong>EAPP</strong>.</p>
