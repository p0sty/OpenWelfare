<p>The Date of Effect (DOE) rules are different for Child Support in comparison to Centrelink.</p>

<p>If Child Support or Centrelink is notified within 28 days of the date the care changes, the date of effect will be the date the care changed for Child Support and Centrelink purposes.</p>

<p>Changes to Child Support legislation effective from 1 July 2018 mean that if Child Support or Centrelink is advised more than 28 days after the date of event, the date of effect for <strong>Child Support purposes</strong> will be the date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care changed for any decrease in the care percentage</li>
		<li>
of notification for any increase in the care percentage</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the 1 July 2018 legislative changes to care date of effect apply to WA ex-nuptial cases if the change was notified on or after 15 May 2019. Changes notified before that date use the pre 1 July 2018 legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Transitional arrangements/grace period&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If a care change occurred before 1 July 2018 and Services Australia was notified before 30 December 2018, during the 26 week 'grace period', (1 July 2018 to 29 December 2018 inclusive), the change took effect for <strong>Child Support purposes</strong> from the date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care changed, if the change was notified within 28 days</li>
		<li>
of notification, if the change was notified outside 28 days</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03040010-01.html">Notification of change in child support care (post 2010</a>) for more information</p>

<p>If a care change occurred prior to 1 July 2018 and is notified after 30 December 2018 for <strong>Child Support purposes</strong>, changes to the care percentage will take effect from the date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care changed for any decrease in the care percentage</li>
		<li>
of notification for any increase in the care percentage</li>
		</ul>
<p>If Centrelink records the correct DOR when applying care decisions and the correct date of event for the care changes the Child Support system will automatically determine and apply the decision correctly under child support law.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; for <strong>Alignment of Care</strong> activities where a DOR more than 12 months in the past is required, it may be necessary to cancel the MFU and create a new activity with source code <strong>CSSAL</strong>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Centrelink system will automatically determine and apply the correct DOE under Family Assistance law as long as the correct date of event and date of notification are recorded by Child Support.</p>

<p>When actioning Alignment of Care MFUs, the MFU may relate to an Accepted (ACP) care assessment by Child Support or a newly commenced Child Support care assessment (pending care decision) or both, as indicated in the text on the MFU.

<p>The PND care should not be applied, as it is not a final decision.</p>

<p><strong>Care updates must be made within the MFU activity</strong></p>

<p>When updating care based on the MFU details, updates must be made within the MFU activity where possible. If error E012ZZ 'Entry Required' presents when updating the FTB Shared Care (<strong>FSC</strong>) screen, change the source to <strong>External</strong> and continue.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this include where a care decision has been made in relation to a non-linked carer.</p>

<p>If the care decision relates to a non-linked carer, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050120-01.html">Linking a child to a customer's record</a>.</p>

<p>Any updates made to care arrangements based on information in an MFU should be applied using the 'date the MFU was received' (DOR of the MFU) as this is the date the information was first received at Centrelink.</p>

<p><strong>MFU may be generated on the child's record</strong></p>

<p>If the relevant child has their own Centrelink record, any AOC MFUs will be generated on the child's record rather than the carer's record.</p>

<p><strong>MFU may contain care details for the other carer</strong></p>

<p>If the relevant child is in a different environment to the carer, the MFU will be generated on the record of the carer in the same environment as the child provided the child does not have their own record.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Carer 1 and child are in environment 'K' and, carer 2 is in environment 'B'. When care details for carer 2 exchange for the child, the MFU will be generated on carer 1's Centrelink record.</p>

<p><strong>Some MFUs are mandated activities</strong></p>

<p>Some MFUs are mandated activities. This means they cannot be 'C'ancelled and must be finalised via the Assessments Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen, even for those which require no action/update.</p>

<p><strong>Care decision for multiple children</strong></p>

<p>If the care decision received generates an MFU, an MFU will be created for each child involved.</p>

<p><strong>Date of receipt (DOR)</strong></p>

<p>Any updates made to care arrangements based on information in an MFU should be applied using the 'date the MFU was received' (DOR of the MFU) as this is the date the information was first received at Centrelink (not the 'decision date' (DCS) included on the MFU).</p>

<p><strong>Multiple MFU activities for the same child with the same DOV</strong></p>

<p>Where there are multiple MFUs for the same child with the same DOV but a different percentage, apply the MFU with the latest decision date (DCS). This can occur when care percentage has been changed based on an appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for MFU&#58;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Care percentage more than 100%</strong> indicator = <strong>Y</strong> received from Child Support. In most cases, this MFU is generated when the parents have become partnered. An MFU activity may display on each person's record and will most likely say that <strong>both</strong> carers have 100% care. This is because when parents reconcile, Child Support generally gives effect to the reconciliation by coding the child/ren in care as 100% each for both parents (200%) from the date they reconciled.</p>

<p><strong>Action required&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If the customer displays as <strong>not partnered</strong>, and&#58;</p>

<p>If an MFU activity displays on a child's record, view details. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51170000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_MFUs_4">Item 4 in Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Note the child's CRN, DOV and percentage from the MFU, then go to the <strong>CHC</strong> screen for the child.</p>

<p>Check that the child is coded <strong>ICC</strong> of the customer for the <strong>DOV</strong> and note if the child is coded <strong>ICC</strong> of any other carers as at this <strong>DOV</strong>.</p>

<p>Go to the <strong>FSC</strong> screen.

If the child is coded <strong>ICC</strong> of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>only one carer</strong> for the <strong>DOV</strong>, the assumed customer's percentage is 100. If the assumed percentage matches the percentage from the MFU, it must be coded on the <strong>FSC</strong> screen within the MFU</li>
		<li>
<strong>more than one carer</strong> for the <strong>DOV</strong>, the assumed 100% percentage will minus any percentage already recorded for that <strong>DOV</strong>. For example, if the customer is parent A and the child is ICC of parent B with 72% recorded, the assumed percentage for parent A is 28%. If the assumed percentage matches the percentage from the MFU, it must be coded on the <strong>FSC</strong> screen within the MFU</li>
		<li>
<strong>more than one carer</strong> for the <strong>DOV</strong> and <strong>the other carer the child was ICC of is/was the customer's partner</strong>, check if the child displays as 100% for the partner for the DOV. If the child is&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
displayed as 100% in the care of the partner for the <strong>DOV</strong>, no coding is required for the <strong>DOV</strong> (as the child cannot be coded as 100% for both)</li>
			<li>
not displayed as 100% in the care of the partner for the <strong>DOV</strong>, update the <strong>FSC</strong> screen for the customer within the MFU</li>

<p><strong>Reason for MFU&#58;</strong></p>

<p>A Child Support care assessment has been received and the percentage of care has changed for a customer in receipt of a social security payment that attracts a higher 'with child' rate of benefit.</p>

<p>Relevant income support customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>single</strong> JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance jobseeker (YAL), or</li>
		<li>
single Special Benefit (SpB)</li>

<p><strong>Action required&#58;</strong></p>

<p>If an MFU activity displays on a child's record, view details. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51170000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_MFUs_4">Item 4 in Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Where care % has been reassessed to below 55% and the change is more than 10% from the previous assessment a <a href="../families/007-02050010-01.html">principal carer determination</a> must be made. If the change is not more than 10% and the percentage of care is between 46% and 54%, a reassessment is not required unless the carer without principal carer status claims they are now the principal carer.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the MFU activity and check the new care % for the child</li>
		<li>
Update the new care percentage&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
updates <strong>must</strong> be made to the FTB Shared Care (<strong>FSC</strong>) screen first. Even if the percentage is correct on <strong>FSC</strong>, make a dummy update to retain the existing information before navigating to the SSA Shared Care (<strong>SSC</strong>) screen</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For customers receiving any Income Support Payment, update the new care % using the correct DOR on the child's <strong>SSC</strong> screen. This will assess for the 'with child' rate for single customers. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51170000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_MFUs_7">Item 7 in Table 1</a></li>
		<li>
If necessary, make a <a href="../job-seekers/001-04030010-01.html">principal carer determination</a> updating the Principal Carer Circumstance Details (<strong>PCCD</strong>) screen (in NSS system) and notify all carers by sending a Q807 letter to each. Use the 'Child - Change in Care Arrangement script' to generate and send the Q807 letters</li>
		<li>
If the Child Support care decision needs clarification or there is a system issue, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51170000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_MFUs_6">Item 6 in Table 1</a></li>
