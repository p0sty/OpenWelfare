<strong>CONFIRMS</strong> the pre-filled employer, they will be asked if this is the same as an employer already recorded. This helps avoid duplication of existing employer details.

<p>Customers must continue to report gross employment income from any non-STP employers and, if required, the number of hours (and minutes for Carer Payment (CP) customers) they have worked in their reporting period.

<p>Statement reporters no longer have a reporting task on their homepage prior to their reporting due date. They cannot record non-STP employment income paid and hours worked prior to their reporting due date. Customers can use the Earnings Worksheet (SU505) to keep track of any pay events and hours worked they need to report on their next reporting due date.</p>

<p>When a customer selects the <strong>Report </strong>task or <strong>Report employment income</strong> (REI) menu option online or in the app<strong> on</strong> their reporting day (or after their reporting day, if reporting late) they can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
confirm, reject or match a pre-filled STP employer name and Australian Business Number (ABN) or Withholding Payer Number (WPN)</li>
		<li>
check, confirm or change pre-filled STP employment income data</li>
		<li>
add additional STP employer pay events that are not pre-filled yet</li>
		<li>
view the pre-filled employment cessation date and reason reported by their STP employer when they cease work. Mutual obligation customers may be required to provide details why they ceased employment, when the cessation reason is <strong>dismissal</strong> or <strong>voluntary</strong></li>
		<li>
answer additional questions when unused leave and redundancy payments have been included with cessation details, such as the amount of days the leave covers or the average weekly wage</li>
		<li>
answer additional questions when unused leave on termination income is included in their pay event, but no employment cessation details are included in the STP data</li>
		<li>
enter their and their partner's (if applicable) non STP employment income paid and if required, hours worked in the reporting period</li>
		<li>
enter <strong>Carer Activity Details</strong> or answer the activity test question (if applicable)</li>
		<li>
view and edit previous reports for up to 6 past reports submitted (this does not apply to confirmed STP employment income)</li>
		<li>
accept the <strong>Declaration</strong> and submit their report</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers benefiting from pre-filled STP data enter into the <strong>STP Confirmation Service</strong> upon commencing the REI task. After confirming the STP data, customers are required to accept the terms and conditions listed in the <strong>STP Declaration</strong> page in the REI task workflow. When accepted, customers are returned to the REI workflow to add any non-STP employment details for them and their partner (if applicable).</p>

<p>Both statement and notification reporters can access the REI task at any time through the <strong>Income and assets</strong> menu option to view and update their previous reports. They can also view their upcoming reporting periods.</p>

<p>A <strong>Reporting tips</strong> message will also show to help customers report the right way. This appears each time they use the service. They need to select <strong>Got it</strong> to continue.</p>
