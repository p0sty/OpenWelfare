<p>A vulnerable customer is someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to disadvantage. Complaints are prioritised based on the customer's circumstances. A high priority issue is when the customer is at risk or vulnerable or the impact on the customer is significant.</p>

<p>If the complaint does not meet an <a target="_blank" href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-05.html#bp05_tbl_01_Escalati">escalation reason</a>, the complaint is managed at the first point of contact. High priority complaints are managed with urgency or as immediately as possible.</p>

<p>Make the relevant service offer to a complainant if they are identified as vulnerable. Use <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-06010030-01.html">indicators of potential vulnerability</a> to assess if it is appropriate to consult with or refer the customer to specialised business areas, including <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12000000-01.html">Social worker services</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender apply to all Australian Government departments and agencies that maintain personal records (including employee records) and collect gender information.</p>

<p>The guidelines outline a consistent standard of evidence when gender is being verified or changed. The guidelines also define the gender classifications of male (m), female (f) and non-binary (x). A person of non-binary gender does not exclusively identify as either male or female.</p>

<p>Currently not all Services Australia’s personal records systems allow staff to update a customer’s records to reflect their gender as non-binary, or indeterminate gender (X). There will be an update to all systems to include a non-binary/indeterminate gender (X) option.</p>

<p>The Restricted Access is available for customers seeking additional protection of personal information held by Services Australia. It is a computer based security system which denies access to the customer's computer record for the majority of staff. Only a limited number of staff in the customer's home service centre and the agency's Canberra site can access the record. The purpose of Restricted Access is to protect the customer's location details.</p>

<p>Restricted Access is available to customers who have genuine fears for their safety, or where there is a risk that a staff member could endanger the customer by accessing the customer's computer record. Restricted Access should only be used in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2015 the Department of Human Services (previous name of Services Australia) introduced changes to the claim and assessment process for Disability Support Pension (DSP). DSP claimants are no longer required to provide a Medical Report (SA012), instead they must provide existing medical evidence, such as clinical notes, test results and specialist reports to support their claim. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03050000-01.html">Eligibility for Disability Support Pension (DSP)</a>.</p>

<p>Claimants may also be required to attend a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) with a Government-contracted doctor (GCD) as part of their claim process. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030090-01.html">Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) referrals</a>.</p>

<p>To manage the complaint&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
determine the issues that will be investigated based on the information provided by the customer</li>
		<li>
ask appropriate and targeted questions to establish whether the complaint is about the rules, the decision, the claim process, the assessment process or the conduct of the assessor or GCD. This will ensure correct recording and attribution of the complaints and assist to determine which team is best placed to help with the complaint investigation and response</li>
		<li>
ask the customer if they have been asked to provide more medical information if appropriate. If it has been less than 21 days since the customer's Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) appointment and the JCA screens show that the assessment is 'on hold' this means the agency is waiting on more medical information from the customer</li>
