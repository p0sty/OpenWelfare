<p>Temporary absences for payments allowing extended portability for approved study (other than YA (Student), Austudy, ABSTUDY and AIC must be referred to Centrelink International Services (CIS).</p>

<p>Carer Payment (CP), Disability Support Pension (DSP), and Parenting Payment (PP) can be paid for the period of approved study or work placement for units being undertaken as part of an Australian course or for periods of work or training that count toward their Apprenticeship. Customers must provide proof of the reason for their absence. Customers must also advise travel dates so the period of approved portability, including any additional travel time can be assessed, and an overseas contact address.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> generally, a customer <strong>studying externally</strong> (for example, by correspondence or online) will not have to attend a campus overseas to complete units of their approved course. However, external students can access extended portability under 'overseas study provisions' if they can demonstrate their primary reason for going overseas is to undertake studies that form part of the course. This could be a residential component at an overseas institution or an overseas work placement, provided it is part of the Australian course.</p>
