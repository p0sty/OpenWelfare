<p>Diagnostic Imaging and Radiation Oncology procedures help to diagnose, treat and monitor an extensive range of illnesses and conditions. Diagnostic imaging services include ultrasound, computed tomography, nuclear medicine, radiography (x-ray), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). DI and RO services are provided with specialised equipment and the professional input of a radiologist (or other medical specialist) to interpret the generated images.</p>

<p><strong>Location Specific Practice Number (LSPN)</strong></p>

<p>Practices intending to provide Medicare eligible diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services must apply to and be registered with Services Australia. As part of their registration, each practice is allocated an LSPN to be used for claiming Medicare benefits. Diagnostic Imaging practices must also be accredited in order for Medicare benefits to be payable.</p>

<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>

<p>An LSPN is required for each practice. Services Australia processes registration forms, allocates and administers LSPNs.</p>

<p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p>

<p>Once a DI practice has an LSPN, they are required to apply for accreditation as specified by the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme (DIAS). Accreditation must be attained and recorded for each modality before Medicare benefits are payable.</p>

<p>Accreditation can be attained from the approved accrediting bodies below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
HDAA Australia Pty Ltd (HDAA)</li>
		<li>
National Association of Testing Authorities Australia (NATA)</li>
		<li>
Quality Innovation Performance (QIP)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Radiation oncology is not subject to DIAS, so is an exception to accreditation requirements. Practices are still required to list radiation oncology equipment with Medicare.</p>

<p>The <a href="../health-professionals/012-41040000-05.html#bp05_L2LL_External_websit">Resources</a> page contains a link to the Department of Health and Aged Care for further details about LSPNs and the DIAS.</p>

<p><strong>Primary details</strong></p>

<p>Sections 23DZV and 23DZZU of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) requires proprietors of practices to advise Services Australia in writing of any change to primary information within 28 days of the change. They must complete a Application to register or amend a diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice form (HW061) to provide the details of the change.</p>

<p>Primary information is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
practice business details, including&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>

		<li>
the types of DI or RO equipment ordinarily located at the premises or base</li>
		<li>
details of legal agreements to use equipment within the premises</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Annual renewal process</strong></p>

<p>Sections 23DZW and 23DZZV of the Act requires practices to respond to requests for information made by Services Australia. Annual reminder letters are automatically sent to practices each year, which requires them to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
confirm all details on the LSPN register are correct and up to date, or</li>
		<li>
submit a HW061 form so the register is up to date</li>
		</ul>
<p>Practices can renew their registration in HPOS if no changes are required.</p>

<p>Once the required information is received, the practice's registration is renewed for an additional 12 months. </p>

<p><strong>Suspension for failing to respond</strong></p>

<p>Failure to respond to this request by the date specified in the notice (which is the registration <strong>End Date</strong> in PDS), results in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Medicare benefits not being payable until a response is received</li>
		<li>
a Work Item being created in PaNDA which prompts an APS5 delegate to consider suspension of registration in line with sections 23DZX or 23DZZW of the Act</li>
		</ul>
<p>Suspensions are actioned by the Provider Services Support team. A letter is automatically sent to the practice advising of the suspension, and that the practice's registration is cancelled if it remains unresponsive for a further 3 months after the registration <strong>End Date</strong>. </p>

<p>A response within this 3 month period results in the practice's registration being renewed for an additional 12 months from the <strong>End Date</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cancellations for failing to respond</strong></p>

<p>Sections 23DZW and 23DZZV of the Act allows Services Australia to cancel the practice's registration if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a practice fails to respond within 3 months after its registration <strong>End Date,</strong> and </li>
		<li>
the above requirements have been met</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Work Item is created in PaNDA for the LSPN record to be referred to an EL1 delegate.</p>

<p>Suspensions are actioned by an EL1 in the Provider Services Support team or the Pathology and Diagnostic Imaging Team. A letter is sent to the practice advising&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the practice's registration has been cancelled </li>
		<li>
the proprietor will not be entitled to request registration of the practice for 12 months from the decision date</li>
		</ul>
<p>Sections 23DZW and 23DZZV of the Act allows a proprietor to write to ask for permission to register the practice within 12 months of a decision to cancel. All requests must be made to the Pathology and Diagnostic Imaging Team as instructed in the cancellation letter. </p>

		<li>
located in an MMM2-7 area (1 November 2022 and after)</li>

<p>The Department is responsible for provision of <strong>MRI licenses</strong>, which give diagnostic imaging practices eligibility to claim Medicare benefits for practices in MMM1 locations. Until 30 October 2022, this was a requirement for all MRI equipment in Australia. </p>

<p>For practices in MMM1 areas, Services Australia must ensure an MRI license has been issued by the Department to a diagnostic imaging practice before adding an eligible MRI to the LSPN Register. The Pathology and Diagnostic Imaging team consults with the Department to administer MRI licences.</p>

<p>From 1 November 2022, MRI equipment located in<strong> MMM 2-7 areas</strong> does not require a licence to be fully eligible for Medicare rebateable services if the other requirements are met. Practices are required to declare they&#58;</p>

<p>Sometimes an MRI licence is temporarily transferred. This happens when equipment is temporarily unavailable because it needs to be repaired, upgraded or replaced. </p>

<p>Where MRI eligibility is temporarily transferred, Health also provides the details for the return of eligibility. Where ineligible MRI equipment exists at the receiving site and this equipment is receiving Medicare eligibility for a limited period, it is not necessary to end date this equipment. The ineligible equipment is not assessed for Medicare purposes and the LSPN register will allow the same serial number, make and model to be recorded where the equipment codes are different.</p>

<p>The same applies if equipment has partial eligibility and the site is temporarily granted full eligibility. The equipment with partial eligibility will retain this eligibility during and after the transfer has ceased (that is, the MBS items claimable on the partially eligible MRI can be claimed on the fully eligible MRI).</p>

<p>Once eligible MRI equipment is replaced, the original machine ceases to be eligible. If eligibility is transferred to another location the practice is required to submit&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an LSPN amendment form (HW061) to request the removal of the MRI machine, and</li>
		<li>
a second amendment form adding the MRI machine at the new location (LSPN). This form should include a list of providers providing MRI services at this location</li>

<p>The capital sensitivity measure’s purpose is to encourage practices to regularly upgrade, and replace their equipment to ensure patients have access to higher quality equipment. </p>

<p>This means that any diagnostic imaging services are no longer payable for services provided using equipment that has exceeded its&#58;</p>

<p>Prior to 1 May 2020, almost all services listed in the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table, excluding PET services, had 2 different schedule fees - schedule '(K)' items (100% of the MBS fee) and schedule '(NK)' items (approximately 50% of the MBS fee) for diagnostic imaging services provided on aged equipment impacted by capital sensitivity. </p>

<p>From 1 May 2020, NK items were removed from the Diagnostic Imaging Service Table (DIST). This means that any equipment that has exceeded its effective life age or maximum extended life age are no longer payable except for those who had a current approved exemption on the date of service.</p>

<p>There were 2 exemption categories in place until 30 April 2022&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
practices located in outer regional, remote and very remote areas were automatically exempt from the capital sensitivity provisions, and</li>
		<li>
practices located in inner regional areas that are also classified as Rural Zone 4 or 5 under the Rural Regional and Remote Area (RRMA) classification system of 1991. The regulations provided that an exemption may be granted, on application, where the equipment&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
was operated on a rare and sporadic basis, and</li>
			<li>
provided crucial patient access to diagnostic imaging services</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Practices could apply for the above exemptions via Department of Health and Aged Care. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-41040000-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to their website.</p>

<p>An additional exceptional circumstances exemption (ECE) was added in conjunction with the 1 May 2020 changes to NK items&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
where the exemption was requested before the end of the equipment’s life age</li>
		<li>
the practice was unable to replace the equipment before its life age due to unforeseen circumstances</li>
