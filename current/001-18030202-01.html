<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Key_principles">Objectives of the Targeted Compliance Framework</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework used by Workforce Australia and Disability Employment Services (DES) providers to encourage job seekers to meet their mutual obligation requirements. That is, to do all that they can to find work and/or participate in employment services and other activities designed to improve their employment prospects.</p>

<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
uses payments suspensions to encourage re-engagement by job seekers who miss the occasional requirement but are generally compliant</li>
		<li>
supports job seekers who are identified as vulnerable to help ensure their requirements are appropriate for their circumstances</li>
		<li>
uses increasing penalties for those job seekers who continue to fail to meet their requirements without a reasonable excuse ending in payment cancellation for the most non-compliance job seekers</li>

<p>Job seekers and participants are encouraged to remain engaged with their provider and their compulsory requirements. They are also encouraged to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ensure their provider is aware of their circumstances, including any circumstances that prevent compliance</li>
		<li>
update their electronic calendar by recording a Personal Event to let their provider know of personal obligations</li>
		<li>
remain in contact with their provider to meet their compulsory activities and appointments</li>
		<li>
contact their provider prior to the scheduled start time if unable to meet a requirement</li>
		<li>
record their own attendance at requirements, if required</li>
		<li>
accepting all offers of <strong>suitable</strong> work</li>

<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework consists of 3 zones for job seekers and participants, these zones are called the&#58;</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>All job seekers and participants begin their return to work journey in the Green Zone. They remain in the Green Zone as long as they meet their all of their compulsory mutual obligation requirements. No financial penalties will apply to the job seeker or participant in the Green Zone, except for work refusal or unemployment failures.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_First_mutual_ob">The Warning Zone</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers who fail to meet a mutual obligation requirement without a valid reason accrue a demerit and move into the Warning Zone. Providers (or Employment Services System (ESS)) identify a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job seeker receives a notice telling them&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they may have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and</li>
		<li>
they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid having their payment suspended</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker does not contact their provider within 2 business days, their payment suspends. Payment remains suspended until they contact their provider and meet any reengagement requirements the provider sets.</p>

<p>Once the job seeker contacts to reengage, the provider will decide if the job seeker did or did not have a valid reason for missing a compulsory mutual obligation requirement. If the provider decided there was not a valid reason, a demerit is recorded The first demerit will move the job seeker from the Green Zone into the Warning Zone.</p>

<p>Generally, where a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job seeker did not have a valid reason one demerit is accrued. However, mutual obligation failures relating to job interviews will fast-track a job seeker to the next Targeted Compliance Framework assessment point. Fast-track mutual obligation failures are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
non-attendance at a job interview</li>
		<li>
misconduct at a job interview, or</li>
		<li>
failing to act on a job offer</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Targeted Compliance Framework assessments points are the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Capability Interview (conducted by the provider), and</li>
		<li>
Capability Assessment (conducted by Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled staff at Services Australia)</li>
		</ul>
<p>No financial penalties will apply to the job seeker or participant in the Warning Zone, except for work refusal or unemployment failures. Each demerit contributes to the job seeker's demerit point count for 6 active months. Job seekers return to the Green Zone automatically when all demerits expire.</p>

<p>Providers continue to monitor a job seekers compliance with their mutual obligation requirements in the Warning Zone.</p>

<p>Repeated non-compliance may trigger the job seeker to reach an assessment point of either the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Capability Interview, or</li>
		<li>
Capability Assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>A <strong>Capability Interview</strong> is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an assessment completed by a provider when a job seeker accrues 3 demerits within a 6 month period or the job seeker has been fast tracked</li>
		<li>
an assessment of the appropriateness of a job seekers requirements based on their individual circumstances </li>
		</ul>
<p>The outcome of a Capability Interview is either, the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
returns to the Green Zone (with demerits reset to zero), when their requirements are considered inappropriate for their circumstances, or</li>
		<li>
continues in the Warning Zone when their requirements are considered appropriate for their circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>A <strong>Capability Assessment</strong> is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a further assessment completed by a PST-skilled staff when a job seeker accrues 5 demerits in a 6 month period or has been fast tracked</li>
		<li>
to ensure the job seekers requirements are achievable based on their individual circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>The outcome of the Capability Assessment is either the job seeker&#58;</p>

disclosing a new circumstances affecting their ability to meet their current requirements, or</li>

<p>Job seekers transition to the Penalty Zone where&#58;</p>

their provider considers requirements are appropriate to their circumstances (following a Capability Interview), and</li>
		<li>
a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia confirms the job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation Plan requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p>In this zone, job seekers who&#58;</p>

meet their compulsory requirements for 3 active months will return to the Green Zone (demerits reset to zero), and</li>
		<li>
those who continue to be non-compliant will face financial penalties or payment cancellation</li>
		</ul>
<p>A mutual obligation failure will restart a job seekers active month period in the Penalty Zone, whereas work refusal and unemployment failures extend a job seekers time in the Penalty Zone.</p>

<p>Job seekers who commit a mutual obligation failure in the Penalty Zone, will have their payment suspended immediately, encouraging job seekers to contact their provider to discuss.</p>

<p>If the provider does not believe the job seeker had a valid reason for their non-compliance, they will submit a Provider report for Services Australia to investigate a possible penalty. The Provider report becomes an active failure for investigation by PST staff on the job seeker's reporting date.</p>

<p>Job seekers may accept a mutual obligation failure penalty when they report online. Job seekers who wish to discuss their reasons for non compliance will have an investigation conducted by PST staff. During the investigation, if reasonable excuse is not established the failure is applied. The applied failure will result in a financial penalty.</p>

A post cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks, or 6 weeks for an unemployment failure where the job seeker received Relocation Assistance for the job in the previous 6 months.
