<p>When a single customer receiving Centrelink payments and services becomes partnered, they must advise Services Australia of the change in relationship status. Entitlement to payments or services is reassessed (for both the customer and their partner if their partner also receives payments or services).</p>

<p>The customer and/or their partner may no longer qualify for income support payments and may have to claim another payment. If they remain eligible, they may have a change in their rate of payment.</p>

<p>At every contact, staff <strong>must </strong>check/update the customer's address (including postal address) and phone details (including mobile phone numbers).</p>

<p>Failure to advise becoming partnered may result in an overpayment. Debt shell activities that generate due to linking a customer to their partner should be left for Debt Staff to investigate. This includes debts due to new claims where a customer now advises they were partnered during a past period of payments where they were paid at the single rate.

a completed paper claim form that contains full partner details and is signed by <strong>both</strong> the customer and their partner. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a partner refuses to provide their details in the customer’s claim form (some couples keep their financial affairs separate and private from each other), a MOD P will be needed before assessing the claim</li>
			<li>
an online claim, if it contains partner details and their partner has completed their task through the 'Partner Confirmation Logon' portal on the Services Australia website, using a TAC. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-20012318-01.html">Confirming a partnered relationship</a></li>

<p>Updating relationship details for customers wishing to claim, but not currently receiving Centrelink payments or services is not required. If a new claim for income support or another payment/concession card is being lodged, updates will be done as part of the new claim. This may result in an overpayment being generated as part of the claim if the customer states their relationship commenced during a period they were previously paid at the single rate.

<p>If a non-current customer notifies of becoming partnered (via a MOD P) their record must still be updated. If they contact by phone to advise they are partnered, the same procedures apply as if they were receiving payments or services.

<p><strong>Confirmation of partner identity</strong></p>

<p>If a customer or the partner does not have a <strong>Confirmed</strong> Identity Confirmation Indicator (<strong>ICI</strong>), they may need to provide documents, which establish commencement of identity (<strong>COI</strong>), and use of identity in the community - Primary Use in the Community (<strong>PUiC</strong>) and Secondary Use in the Community (<strong>SUiC</strong>). The link between the identity and the person will then be established via a photographic identity document. For more information, including payments and services it applies to, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-09010000-01.html">Identity Confirmation</a>.</p>
