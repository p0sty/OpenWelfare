<p>In Greece, the pension insurance legislation needs the compulsory payment of social security contributions on behalf of employees, usually through deductions from paid employment.</p>

<p>Contributions insure employees against disability and unemployment and provides for income in the form of a pension once the person reaches retirement age.</p>

<p>The legislation is the responsibility of the Greek government but the collection of contributions and payment of pensions is the responsibility of the various pension funds. These are broadly arranged to cover the different industries.</p>

<p>There are secondary occupational schemes and voluntary, private insurance.</p>

Overlapping periods are only counted once (Article 11.3)</li>

<p>Unlike most other agreements, the Agreement with Greece refers to the Australian legislation to decide the income assessed and the maximum rate that is used in the rate calculation but specifies the proportion to be used (Article 12.1).</p>

<p>This means</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customers paid under the Agreement who are outside Australia are paid a proportional rate according to their Australian <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06030000-01.html">Working Life Residence (WLR)</a>,</li>
		<li>
the Rate Limiter/Limited Rate does not apply, and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
additional child amounts are included in the proportional rate. These amounts are paid automatically as a component of the Australian pension if the customer is qualified (S14A SS(IA)A 1999)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For customers who were Australian residents on 1 October 2008, the date the Agreement started, the proportion to be used is the customer's Australian <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06030000-01.html">Working Life Residence (WLR)</a> (to a maximum of 300 months) divided by 300 (Article 12.2).</p>

<p>For customers who were <strong>not</strong> residents of Australia on implementation, the proportion is the customer's WLR (to a maximum of 528 months) divided by 528. This is referred to as the 528 denominator.</p>

<p>The Agreement proportional rate will override the domestic proportional rate for any absence within 2 years of the date they became an Australian resident again. In this case, code <strong>Agreement Country</strong> and <strong>Agreement year</strong> again on the <a class="modal-link" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Coding_the_Addi">Australian Residence Details (ARD) screen</a> on departure. The 528 denominator applies for the duration of the absence, if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is paid the 528 denominator rate,</li>
		<li>
becomes an Australian resident again, and</li>
		<li>
is transferred to autonomous</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Greek Agreement does <strong>not</strong> include the proportionalisation of any Greek pension in the income test (Randisi Concession).</p>

<p>Although a person may be qualified for an Australian payment or portable outside Australia, if the customer has no WLR the rate of payment outside Australia will be nil.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> In some circumstances, their partner's WLR may be used. See Australian <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06030000-01.html">Working Life Residence (WLR)</a>.</p>

<p>When a person is paid a proportional rate under an agreement, Rent Assistance (RA) cannot be paid. Other add-ons such as Energy Supplement and Pension Supplement are payable under normal add-ons portability rules. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01070000-01.html">Portability of Add-ons</a></p>

<p>Examples of when a customer is paid a proportional rate includes (but not limited to)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
permanently overseas</li>
		<li>
temporarily overseas longer than 26 weeks for age pension</li>
		<li>

<p>The proportional rate continues to apply for the first 26 weeks of a temporary return to Australia (Article 12.4).</p>

<p>If there is no change to the country of residence, any movement is considered temporary and a review is set to automatically change the rate after a continuous period of 26 weeks.

<p>Customers in Australia under the Agreement are paid a direct deduction rate (Article 12.6). That is, all Greek payments covered by the Agreement, including social welfare payments, are not assessed as income but will be deducted dollar-for-dollar from the maximum rate of the Australian payment before the application of the income or assets test.</p>

<p>The Agreement does <strong>not</strong> include a Comparison Rate in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the rate paid from grant of a new claim is based on where the customer is present, even if resident in the other country and irrespective of the 26 week temporary departure provision.</p>

<p>For example, a person who is <strong>resident in Greece</strong> lodges a claim while <strong>temporarily in Australia&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If granted from a date <strong>when they were or are still in Australia</strong>, they will be paid the direct deduction rate from grant. The rate will swap to the proportional rate from the date they leave Australia.</li>
		<li>
If granted from a date <strong>when they were again outside Australia</strong>, for example, early claim, they will be paid the proportional rate immediately.</li>

<p>Policy advice is that it is not reasonable for a customer to be expected to travel to Greece or incur significant cost to get an AFM. Customers who choose not to pursue a claim or maintain their Greek pension only because of AFM issues should not be penalised.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; this does not apply to customers in Greece who should be able to comply with Greek requirements</p>

<p>Other requirements for payment of Greek pensions such as for AMKA, life certificates or bank accounts are considered reasonable in all cases. Delays in processing of information by the Greek authorities or difficulties in contacting the Greek authorities is not sufficient reason to apply an exemption.</p>

<p>While every effort should be made to help the customer, a decision may be made to decide that the customer does not need to claim or to remove the Greek pension and reassess their Australian pension provided it is determined that it is not reasonable for the customer to take the necessary steps to get the Greek pension.</p>

<p>The Greek pension authorities may advise the grant of a Greek pension, including arrears payment, before the income is released to the customer. Customers may not actually receive any payment if they do not meet the requirements, including an AFM.</p>

<p>For this reason, policy advice has approved specialist coding for Greek NOGs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Code the ongoing Greek pension from the correct date of event as normal. See <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-08030000-01.html">Foreign Pension coding</a>.</li>
		<li>
If the customer is outside Australia or the coding of the Greek pension does not result in a rate reduction, continue with normal procedures.</li>
