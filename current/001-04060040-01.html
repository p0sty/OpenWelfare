<p>YA and ABSTUDY customers who are independent are not subject to assessment under the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02000000-01.html">Parental Means Test</a>. Independent DSP customers receive a higher rate of payment than dependent DSP customers.</p>

<p>A YA, ABSTUDY or DSP customer is considered independent if they have supported themselves through <strong>full-time paid employment</strong> for at least 18 months within any 2 year period. This 2 year period does not have to be since leaving secondary school. Full-time employment is defined as having worked for at least 30 hours per week throughout the 18 months. Where the work has not consistently been at least 30 hours per week the hours of work can be averaged over periods of a maximum of 13 weeks.</p>

<p>A DSP customer is also considered independent if they have supported themselves through <strong>part-time paid employment</strong> of at least 15 hours per week for at least 2 years since last leaving secondary school. They are also considered independent if they have supported themselves through <strong>paid work with cumulative earnings</strong> of at least 75% of the Wage Level A of the <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/1/1/n/12">National Training Wage schedule</a> included in a modern award in an 18 month period since last leaving secondary school.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
of overseas employment</li>
		<li>
of paid leave, including receiving Pandemic Leave Disaster Payments (PLDP)</li>
		<li>
of unpaid leave due to employer shut down that are outside the control of the young person (for example, mandatory Christmas shutdown)</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Where a YA or ABSTUDY customer has indicated in their online claim they are independent under the self-supporting criterion, they will be asked to enter their employment details. This includes their employer/s, hours worked and income earned. Based on that information, the system will determine if the customer has worked enough hours to be considered independent. These customers may not need to provide evidence such as payslips or payroll reports to verify their employment history. When a customer claims for YA online as a full-time student, the online claim responses will automatically determine which students are required to provide evidence.</p>

<p>Where the customer is presented with a task at <strong>Next Steps</strong> in their online claim, they must provide one or more of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Payslips</li>
		<li>
Payroll report</li>
		<li>
Payment summaries</li>
		<li>

be at least 18 years old</li>
		<li>
have had full-time employment of at least 30 hours per week for a period of at least 12 months, or for periods that total at least 12 months</li>

not be living at the home of either or both of their parents</li>
		<li>
be specially disadvantaged with respect to education or employment<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> see below for specially disadvantaged</li>
		<li>
not be receiving financial support, whether directly or indirectly, from their parent(s) or from another person who is acting as their guardian on a long-term basis</li>

a person whose personal circumstances and labour market skills make it difficult for them to find a job, for example, a person who is classified as 'at high risk' on the Job Seeker Snapshot is considered to be specially disadvantaged with respect to employment</li>

<p>This criterion is reviewable if the customer's circumstances change.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the special safety net criterion does not apply to ABSTUDY.</p>
