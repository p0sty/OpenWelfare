<p>In 2019, Annabelle was studying full-time by distance education. Partway through Term 2 Annabelle is also doing some subjects at the local New South Wales school as part of a re-integration program.</p>

<p>Annabelle's parent confirms Annabelle is still studying the rest of the subjects via the approved distance education provider.</p>

<p>Annabelle is therefore studying 37.5% workload by face-to-face and 62.5% workload by distance education. The Term 2 instalment period has 91 days and runs from 1 April to 30 June 2019.</p>

<p>In the Term 2 instalment period the full distance education allowance was payable from 1 April to 21 May 2019 (51 days). The pro-rata rate takes effect from 22 May to 30 June 2019 (40 days)&#58;</p>

<p>Charlie's health issues have had varying impacts on Charlie's ability to attend the local school. As a result, Charlie's hours at school and home have varied over the last 2 terms.</p>
