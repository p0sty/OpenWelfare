	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a CDP job seeker does not meet their compulsory requirements, the CDP provider may choose to use the CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework to improve engagement and reinforce mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>The types of compliance actions that can be initiated by a CDP provider include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
suspension of payment via the submission of a Non-Attendance Report (NAR)</li>
		<li>
No Show, No Pay, connection, and serious failure, or Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) investigations including in some cases suspension of payment via the submission of Participation Reports</li>
		<li>
non-attendance and reconnection failure investigations via the submission of Provider Appointment Reports (PAR), or</li>
		<li>
Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA) via the submission of Comprehensive Compliance Assessment Requests where there are indicators the CDP job seeker has unidentified barriers to compliance</li>
		</ul>
<p>All provider initiated compliance actions require appropriate consideration before a decision is made to apply a failure or UNPP. Once Services Australia have investigated and made a decision regarding the provider initiated compliance action, the outcome will be electronically forwarded to the provider.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Attending_compu"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Attending_compu">Attending compulsory CDP provider appointments</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CDP job seekers who are receiving participation payments are required to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attend appointments with their provider when notified of a requirement to do so, and</li>
		<li>
contact their provider prior to the scheduled appointment start time if they will be unable to attend a compulsory appointment to discuss their reasons for this</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a CDP provider accepts the reasons why a CDP job seeker will be unable to attend, the provider may reschedule the appointment and issue a new connection requirement without initiating compliance action.</p>

<p>When a CDP job seeker fails to attend a regular or reconnection appointment, a CDP provider may submit either a Non-Attendance Report (NAR) to trigger suspension of payment or both a NAR and a Provider Attendance Report (PAR) to trigger a compliance investigation for Services Australia to investigate and finalise. The PAR will be used only after the provider has spoken to the CDP job seeker about the reason for non-compliance and considers the imposition of a financial penalty as the best way to ensure future compliance by that CDP job seeker.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_NonAttendance_">Non-Attendance Reports (NAR)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the provider decides to submit a NAR they are responsible for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reporting a CDP job seeker's non-attendance at the compulsory appointment to Services Australia within 2 working days of the event to suspend payment</li>
		<li>
notifying the CDP job seeker their payment is no longer payable due to the missed appointment</li>
		<li>
discussing with the CDP job seeker their reasons for non-attendance, and</li>
		<li>
reconnecting the CDP job seeker following the submission of a NAR</li>
		</ul>
<p>The formal notification issued to the CDP job seeker to attend the appointment will be attached to the NAR, and will include the date, time and location of the appointment.</p>

<p>When a NAR has been submitted, the Services Australia system will automatically&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
suspend the CDP job seeker's payment with reason 'Non-Attendance Report Received' (ANR)</li>
		<li>
prevent the CDP job seeker from finalising their reporting statement until the ANR suspension is lifted</li>
		<li>
send a letter to the CDP job seeker notifying the suspension decision and that they must contact their provider to discuss the NAR</li>
		<li>
display messaging via self service (IVR, mobile app and the online landing page) advising the CDP job seeker to contact their provider regarding the outstanding NAR</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally suspension occurs from the start of the instalment period in which the NAR is received or the day after the date paid or reported to (whichever is the later) unless payment has already been suspended for another reason. In these cases, the ANR suspension is automatically applied once the other suspension is lifted.</p>

<p>CDP job seekers need to contact the provider to discuss the outstanding NAR. During this contact, the provider is responsible for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
determining if the NAR is still required</li>
		<li>
determining if reconnection is required and negotiating a suitable re-engagement appointment within 2 days</li>
		<li>
notifying the CDP job seeker of the reconnection requirement, including providing them with the appropriate compliance warnings</li>
		<li>
recording the CDP job seeker's acceptance or refusal of the reconnection requirement, and</li>
		<li>
finalising the NAR so information will be electronically transmitted to the Services Australia system</li>
		</ul>
<p>The job seeker's payment will be automatically restored once the provider finalises the NAR and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
updates the CDP job seeker's record to verify attendance at a re-engagement appointment for the submitted NAR, or</li>
		<li>
updates the NAR to advise the CDP job seeker is no longer required to attend the re-engagement appointment</li>
		</ul>
<p>In <strong>limited circumstances</strong>, PST-skilled Service Officers with WNPPD or PFDEC security resources can manually finalise a NAR. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10080020-01.html">Restoring payment where a payment suspension (participation) has been imposed for Community Development Program (CDP) participants</a> for further details.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>If the provider decides to submit a PAR for the CDP job seeker's non-attendance at the compulsory appointment (including reconnection appointments), the provider is responsible for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reporting a CDP job seeker's non-attendance at the compulsory appointment via a NAR</li>
		<li>
notifying the CDP job seeker their participation payment is not payable due to the appointment they missed</li>
		<li>
discussing the reasons for non-attendance with the job seeker</li>
		<li>
reconnecting the CDP job seeker during the discussion, and</li>
		<li>
submitting a valid PAR for the same non-attendance event date as the NAR, triggering either a Non-Attendance Failure or a reconnection failure for Services Australia to investigate</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> providers are unable to have a PAR withdrawn once it has been submitted.</p>

<p>Providers can however supply additional evidence to Services Australia to assist Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers determine whether&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the compliance action generated as a result of the PAR was invalid, or</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker had a reasonable excuse and a valid reason for not making prior contact (where applicable)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The type of failure generated from a PAR depends on the type of appointment the CDP job seeker did not attend. Failure to attend&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a 'regular' appointment will result in a non-attendance failure</li>
		<li>
an appointment that was a reconnection requirement will result in a reconnection failure</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following provider re-engagement appointment type is booked by Services Australia&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
RAPRC - Re-engagement appointment booked for a connection or reconnection failure</li>
		<li>
RACOA - Re-engagement appointment booked for a serious failure waiver</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> re-engagement appointments booked for a serious failure waiver (RACOA) will trigger the re-application of the serious failure where they are finalised with a 'Did not attend result - invalid (DNAI)' or 'Did not enter Job Plan (DNEP)'. A NAR and/or PAR are not used in these circumstances.</p>

<p>When a CDP job seeker is non-compliant with a compulsory connection requirement (other than non-attendance at a compulsory provider appointment), the CDP provider may submit a Participation Report to notify Services Australia they wish to pursue formal compliance action.</p>

<p>The provider may submit a Participation Report to trigger compliance action as a result of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
non-attendance at a compulsory third party appointment the provider has arranged</li>
		<li>
refusal to enter a Job Plan</li>

a No Show, No Pay failure</li>
		<li>
a connection failure</li>
		<li>
a serious failure, or</li>

an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a Participation Report is received for a connection failure the CDP job seeker's payment <strong>may be suspended</strong> until they agree to re-engage (with their provider) or it is determined re-engagement is no longer required.</p>

<p>All provider generated investigations require consideration of the circumstances relevant to the incident before a decision is made to apply a failure or UNPP.</p>

<p>All Participation Reports submitted to Services Australia for consideration must be in a valid format. A valid format includes&#58;</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework focuses on encouraging CDP job seekers receiving participation payments to remain engaged with their CDP provider and to comply with their mutual obligation requirements. Financial penalties are only imposed for failures within a CDP job seeker's control, for example, as a result of deliberate or persistent non-compliance.</p>

<p>A financial penalty may occur as a result of the following types of compliance action&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
No Show, No Pay failures</li>
		<li>
non-attendance failures</li>
		<li>
reconnection failures</li>
		<li>
serious failures</li>
		<li>
Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP)</li>
		</ul>
<p>CDP job seekers who incur a No Show, No Pay failure, connection failure, non-attendance failure or reconnection failure are encouraged to re-engage quickly to avoid or reduce financial penalties.</p>

<p>CDP job seekers who incur a serious failure are encouraged to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment in lieu of serving some or all of the serious failure period. CDP job seekers who do not have the capacity to attend the waiver re-engagement appointment and are in severe financial hardship may be eligible for payment under hardship provisions during the serious failure penalty period. Hardship provisions may also be considered where the CDP job seeker has a UNPP applied and is in a class of persons as specified in the relative Legislative Instrument.</p>

<p>In some cases, a CDP job seeker demonstrating ongoing non-compliance may have their participation payment cancelled due to loss of qualification.</p>

<p>PST-skilled Service Officers will not be required to re-engage the CDP job seeker or restore payment for PARs. This is part of the NAR process that the provider is responsible for completing.</p>
