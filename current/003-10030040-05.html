<p><strong>What is RTGS and how does it work?</strong></p>

<p>The agency has the capacity to deliver Real Time Gross Settlement payments in a secure environment.</p>

<p>RTGS is a payment mechanism that enables funds to be delivered to a customer's bank account (if it is RTGS enabled) within the day, or by 9 am the next working day, rather than the traditional direct credit, 1 or 2 working day waiting period.</p>

<p>3</p></td>

<p><strong>Doesn't Real Time mean instantly, why does it take an hour for the payment to be delivered?</strong></p>

<p>Settlement in 'real time' means the payment transaction is not subjected to the traditional direct credit 1 and 2 working day waiting period. However, payments by the NPP will be delivered immediately in actual real time 24 hours a day, every day of the year including public holidays.</p>

<p>'Gross settlement' means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one basis without bunching with any other transaction. Once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.</p>

<p>The order of preference for methods of payment is&#58;</p>

Direct Credit (the preferred method) into the customer's account</li>
		<li>
NPP into the customer's account (if available)</li>

<p>If the Payment Nominee or parent approves an alternative method of payment to be paid to the customer, the reason 'Payment nominee or parent approved alternative payment method' is to be recorded in the Immediate Payment requests script and an alternative method of payment is to be used, such as an EBT card.</p>

<p><strong>If it is close to the RTGS closing time, should an alternative method of payment be used?</strong></p>

<p>If available, RTGS should be used up to the 3&#58;30 pm closing time. If the activity is selected by QOL and it is checked and released quickly, it may still be delivered before the close of business. A small buffer of a couple of minutes has been built into the system for these rare cases.</p>

<p>RTGS will be able to be selected as the payment method after 3&#58;30 pm (NSW and VIC time) but the payment will not be issued until the next business day. If the payment is being made to the smaller banks and credit unions, it may take up to 2 working days to be received into the customer's account.</p>

<p>Customers requesting an urgent payment by IVR or Centrelink online account can choose 'priority direct credit'. This will deliver using NPP by default, or RTGS if account is not NPP-reachable. The same delivery rules will apply to this as when payment is made by a Service Officer.</p>

<p><strong>If I change the payment destination, can I then issue the urgent payment by RTGS?</strong></p>

<p>No, an RTGS payment is only be made to an account the customer has a history of receiving their regular Services Australia payments in.</p>

<p>If the customer requests to change their payment destination, this is to be done as a separate activity. When the urgent payment assessment has been completed, the reason 'New payment destination account' is to be recorded in the Immediate Payment requests script and an alternative method of payment is to be used, that is, Direct Credit or an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card.</p>

<p><strong>Why are the hours of operation limited to 8&#58;00 am to 3&#58;30 pm (NSW and Victoria time)?</strong></p>

<p>RTGS is operated by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in offices in New South Wales and Victoria. The hours of operation are set by the RBA and make sure that the payments issued by Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) are delivered on the same day they are processed.</p>

<p>The RBA operates the RTGS system from its offices located in Sydney and Melbourne. On national or concurrent public holidays, both of these offices will be closed.</p>

<p>If the public holiday is in either Sydney or Melbourne, the other office will operate the system, allowing payment by RTGS to be made.</p>

<p><strong>What will happen if the activity is selected for Quality On Line (QOL)?</strong></p>

<p>If an urgent payment by RTGS is selected by QOL, the payment will not be issued until the activity has been checked and finalised.</p>

<p>For this reason, it is vital that the activity is to be urgently checked and finalised during the customer contact (either on the phone or face-to-face). The customer is then to be advised of the outcome and that the payment will be delivered before the close of business.</p>

<p>If the QOL activity is not finalised and the activity released by 3&#58;30 <strong>pm the payment will not be delivered until the next working day</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What will happen if the payment is made to an overdrawn bank account?</strong></p>

<p>When an account is overdrawn (even if it is only by a few cents), it needs manual intervention by the Financial Institution's staff for the funds to be credited to the account. This will cause a delay. The customer will need to attend the Branch and make a repayment agreement with them before the funds are credited to their account.</p>

<p>If the payment is made to an overdrawn account, all or part of the payment may be withheld by the bank to repay the customer's overdrawn balance.</p>

<p>While the banking industry has committed that only 10% of a <strong>regular income support payment</strong> made by the agency will be withheld for this purpose, the customer will need to contact the bank and may need to make a payment arrangement with them before the funds are returned.</p>

<p>If the account is overdrawn, the customer must decide if they wish to have the payment made this way. The customer should be advised that the financial institution may withhold some or all of the overdrawn amount from the payment and that there may be a delay in the payment being deposited into their account.</p>

<p>If the customer does not want the payment into the account because it is overdrawn, the reason 'Customer's account overdrawn' is to be recorded in the Immediate Payment requests script and an alternative method of payment is to be used, such as an EBT card.</p>

<p><strong>If the payment has been made to an overdrawn bank account, can it be reissued?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If the bank account is overdrawn, should I increase the amount to be paid by 10% or pay another urgent payment to cover this amount?</strong></p>

<p>No, the agreement the Banking Industry made to only withhold 10% of a payment made by the agency only relates to <strong>regular Income Support Payments</strong> by Direct Credit. It does not relate to Immediate Payments issued by RTGS. Immediate Payments will be withheld to repay overdrawn accounts.</p>

<p>Before issuing the urgent payment, the Service Officer should check with the customer if their account is overdrawn. If it is, the reason 'Customer's account overdrawn' is to be recorded in the Immediate Payment requests script and an alternative method of payment is to be used, such as an EBT card.</p>

<p><strong>What will happen if the payment is made to a closed bank account?</strong></p>

<p>Just like a direct credit, if the payment is made to a closed bank account the payment will be returned and should be reissued. The '<strong>RTN</strong>' or '<strong>REJ</strong>' code may not appear on the customer's Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen immediately. In these cases, the Service Officer should call the customer's bank and verify the account is closed before reissuing the payment to the customer.</p>

In these cases, the Service Officer should call the customer's bank and verify the customer does not have legal access to the account before reissuing the payment to the customer.</p>

<p>If the customer does have legal access to the account, they are not entitled to have the money reissued.</p>

<p>If the customer does not have legal access to the account, the funds are to be recalled and then reissued to the customer.</p>
