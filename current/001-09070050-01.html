<p>This document outlines the Services Australia process for approving self-employment as an approved activity for job seekers who choose to use their self-employment to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>Services Australia must approve the self-employment approved activity, regardless of whether the job seeker is managed by Services Australia or their provider.</p>

<p>Some job seekers are able to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
participating in self-employment as an approved activity</li>
		<li>
doing enough hours, and</li>
		<li>
declaring enough business income to satisfy the sufficient work test</li>
		</ul>
<p>Details are recorded on the job seeker's Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen where they are fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements through self-employment.</p>

<p>Job seekers may also use self-employment to meet their Work for the Dole (WFD) Phase requirements, if the Workforce Australia provider agrees to it.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Self-employment that meets the sufficient work test can be used to fully satisfy mutual obligations requirements for job seekers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are principal carers</li>
		<li>
have a partial capacity to work (PCW) of 15 hours or more per week (0-7 hours per week or 8-14 hours per week) or a TRWC (0-7 hours per week or 8-14 hours per week) or</li>
		<li>
are 55 years and over</li>

<p>The sufficient work test has 2 parts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the minimum hours requirement, and</li>
		<li>
the minimum remuneration requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>A job seeker must meet <strong>both</strong> requirements to satisfy the sufficient work test.</p>

<p>The minimum number of hours for job seekers aged 55 and over, and principal carer parents is 30 hours per fortnight. For job seekers with a reduced work capacity, the number of hours depends on their assessed work capacity.</p>

<p>A person will fully meet their mutual obligation requirements if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the total hours worked is at least the minimum number required for the person, and</li>
		<li>
the remuneration from net business income is at least the applicable hourly rate (usually the <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070050-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">national minimum wage</a> or applicable occupation award wage), multiplied by the minimum number of hours required for the person</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers who do not satisfy the sufficient work test must be referred to a Workforce Australia provider because they cannot fully meet their mutual obligation requirements through self-employment only.</p>

<p>In these cases, use the sufficient work test to work out the additional hours of work required. This is assessed as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the amount earned is already sufficient to meet the remuneration test, the person must undertake, or look for, at least the number of hours required to bring the work up to the minimum hours requirement, or</li>
		<li>
if the amount earned is insufficient, the person must look for, or undertake, the number of hours required to meet the target remuneration amount</li>

<p>If the job seeker's self-employment fully meets their mutual obligation requirements, the approved activity must be recorded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen.

The job seeker is automatically suspended from Employment Provider Services and there is no need for them to discuss this with their Employment Services Provider.

<p>Sometimes a job seeker may not complete the specified hours to satisfy their requirements for the fortnight. Self-employment income does not need to be declared each fortnight, as it is assessed on an annual basis, and the assessed self-employment income on their record is to be used for checking the sufficient work test has been satisfied. The Service Officer should check if the job seeker has a reasonable excuse for not meeting the requirements of their Job Plan. The only acceptable reasonable excuses for not meeting requirements are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a sick child (or children)</li>
		<li>
a cancelled shift</li>
		<li>
a short term reduction in hours due to public holidays</li>

		<li>

<p>There is an expectation working hours will return to normal in the next fortnight.</p>

<p>In addition, there are strict limits about how often to accept a reasonable excuse before renegotiating the Job Plan.</p>

<p>A failure to meet the requirements will not lead to compliance action. Instead, the job seeker should&#58;</p>

be referred to an Employment Services Provider</li>
