quarterly and/or yearly caps</li>

whether the subsidy percentage reduced within the claim period (such as from BAC to CAC, or when transitioning to the third 12-month period for PWS). periods of receipt of other wage subsidies within the claim period</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is possible for a single or multiple factors to affect the amount of subsidy.</p>

<p>Review the claim, considering all impacts. Take action or advise the employer, based on the impact/s and claim status.</p>

<p>Escalate the claim via the Contact card web form, to create an AWSE referral for enquiries that cannot be answered using the information displayed in ADMS.</p>

<p>The amount of wage subsidy is based on the gross employment income paid within the claiming period. </p>

<p>BAC and CAC have set claim (wage) periods of 3 month duration, see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-22022208-01.html">Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements (BAC) and Completing Apprenticeship Commencements (CAC) wage subsidies</a>.</p>

<p>PWS also has claim (wage) periods that are 3 months in duration, however the start and end dates differ between apprentices. The claim period for PWS is based on the apprentice’s commencement date. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-22090854-01.html">Priority Wage Subsidy (PWS)</a>.</p>

<p>Take note of the <strong>Claim Period</strong> displayed in ADMS.</p>

<p>Check if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the employer entered the correct dates in the <strong>Date from</strong> and <strong>Date to</strong> fields in the claim</li>
		<li>
the date entered in the <strong>Date from</strong> field in the claim matches the beginning of the first payslip or payroll summary</li>
		<li>
the date entered in the <strong>Date to</strong> field in the claim matches the end date of the last payslip or payroll summary</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the employer provides a payroll summary as wage evidence, the payroll summary dates must align with the full claim period.</p>

<p>If the apprenticeship was not in place for the entire claim period (for example, the Apprentice commenced or completed/cancelled during the claim period), the payroll summary to and from dates should reflect the dates that the Apprenticeship was in place.</p>

<p>If an employer provides payslips and/or enters a date range in the claim for wages paid outside of the claiming period, ADMS will not include these wages when determining the subsidy to be paid. ADMS will only consider the wages paid for dates within the claim period when calculating the subsidy.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Claim period 1 January 2022 – 31 March 2022</li>
		<li>
Employer declares a&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
date range in the claim of 1 October 2021 – 31 March 2022, and</li>
			<li>
gross amount of $6,000 wages paid</li>
			</ul>			</ul>

<p>The amount of AWS is based on the gross employment income paid within the claiming period, while the apprenticeship is current. An apprentice may cease (suspend, complete or cancel) or recommence (following suspension or cancellation) their apprenticeship during the claim period.</p>

<p>For BAC/CAC, an apprentice may also commence their apprenticeship during the claim period. That is because the claim periods have set start and end dates, see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-22022208-01.html">Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements (BAC) and Completing Apprenticeship Commencements (CAC)</a>. </p>

<p>For PWS, an apprentice cannot commence their apprenticeship part way through the claim period. That is because the claim period start date is determined by the apprenticeship start date, see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-22090854-01.html">Priority Wage Subsidy (PWS)</a>.</p>

<p>Gross wages are not included in the calculation of the AWS if they were paid during the claim period, but&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before the apprenticeship commenced, </li>
		<li>
during a period of suspension or cancellation (prior to recommencement), or </li>
		<li>
after cancellation or completion of the apprenticeship </li>
		</ul>
<p>Check if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the apprenticeship commenced during through the claim period (if applicable)</li>
		<li>
the apprentice recommenced, completed or cancelled their apprenticeship during t the claim period</li>
		<li>
the employer entered the correct date of commencement, completion or cancellation of the apprenticeship in the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Claim period 1 January 2023 – 31 March 2023</li>
		<li>
Employer declares a&#58;</li>

date range in the claim of 1 January – 31 March 2023</li>

		<li>
The apprentice commenced their apprenticeship on 1 July 2022</li>
		<li>
The apprentice ceased their apprenticeship on 28 February 2023</li>
		</ul>
<p>In this example, ADMS will calculate the subsidy based on the gross wages paid during the period 1 January to 28 February 2023, the date the apprenticeship ceased If the employer has provided incorrect information on the commencement, completion or cancellation of an apprenticeship, the following action is required, depending on the ADMS status&#58;</p>

<p>BAC, CAC and PWS subsidies are payable up to a capped amount per quarter for wages paid in the 12-month period from the date the apprenticeship starts. To identify the capped amount, see </p>
