<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> authorised representatives cannot nominate themselves.</p>

<p>Both authorised representatives have equal authority to act on the proprietor’s behalf. The only difference between the 2 is that system generated correspondence is addressed to the primary authorised representative.</p>

<p>Where a new Authorised Representative&#58;</p>

the applicant can attach a letter to the form that has been signed by a responsible executive officer authorising the change of representative</li>

this request must explain the authority this person has to act on behalf of the proprietor, including their position</li>

<p>Diagnostic Imaging and Radiation Oncology Practices are required to update registration details as recorded by Services Australia (the agency) when those changes occur. An annual reminder letter is sent to practices requesting an update to details contained on the register.</p>

<p>Should an authorised person from the practice fail to respond by the 'end date,' their registration may be suspended. If they fail to respond within 3 months from the date of suspension, their registration may be cancelled.</p>

<p>Service Officers renew the registration of active and suspended practices. Registrations of active and suspended practices can also be renewed via HPOS by an Administrator. Delegate approval is required to suspend or cancel a practice. Delegate approval is required to reinstate a cancelled practice registration. Any request to register a practice which was cancelled in the previous 12 months must be escalated to Local Peer Support (LPS) for consideration by the Pathology and Diagnostic Imaging Team.</p>

<p>For more details on the renewal, suspension and cancellation process, see <a target="_blank" href="../health-professionals/012-41040000-01.html">Eligibility and Location Specific Practice Number (LSPN) registration for Diagnostic Imaging (DI) and Radiation Oncology (RO)</a></p>

<p>A diagnostic imaging practice can only request accreditation of Diagnostic Imaging modalities with an accreditor once the practice is registered and been allocated an LSPN. The practice can then contact one of the 3 approved accrediting bodies to arrange accreditation&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
HDAA Australia Pty Ltd (HDAA)</li>
		<li>
Quality Innovation Performance (QIP)</li>
		<li>
National Association of Testing Authorities Australia (NATA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The chosen accrediting body will provide a report to the agency with the modalities and accreditation period for which the practice has been accredited. Eligibility for Medicare benefits for services on specified modalities will commence on the accreditation start date. </p>

<p>Current accreditation details are available on the published extract of the LSPN register from 19 June 2022. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-41040040-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the register.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> accreditation is not required for Radiation Oncology practices.</p>

<p><strong>Processing Accreditation Reports in PDS</strong></p>

<p>Accreditation reports are sent to the agency and uploaded into PaNDA. There are 4 types of accreditations updates. These include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
creating new start and end dates for each modality</li>
		<li>
ending accreditation for a modality</li>
		<li>
amending existing start and end dates for a modality</li>
		<li>
renewing accreditation for each modality</li>
		</ul>
<p>Only one current accrediting body should be listed on the Modality Accreditation screen. Where there is no cessation report for a previous accreditation, the previous accreditation body is contacted to obtain a copy of the cessation report prior to processing the new modality report.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The capital sensitivity measure’s purpose is to encourage diagnostic imaging practices to regularly upgrade, and replace their equipment. This provides more access to higher quality equipment. </p>

<p>This means that any diagnostic imaging services that have been performed are no longer payable where that equipment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has exceeded its effective life age, or </li>

maximum extended life age</li>

<p>MRI equipment is not automatically eligible for Medicare payable services. There are currently 3 types of MRI equipment to reflect this&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Fully eligible (MR1) </li>
		<li>
Partially eligible (MR3) </li>
		<li>
Ineligible (MR4)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Medicare eligible MRI equipment </strong></p>

<p>MRI equipment must be co-located in a practice which also provides x-ray, ultrasound and computed tomography services in order to be eligible for Medicare benefits. </p>

<p>In addition to this requirement, an MRI machine can be fully eligible if it is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
granted a licence from the Department of Health and Aged Care, or</li>
		<li>
located in a MMM 2-7 area (after 1 November 2022)</li>
		</ul>
<p>MRI equipment can only become partially eligible if a licence is granted by the Department of Health and Aged Care. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Eligible MRI providers</strong></p>

<p>To provide services on eligible MRI equipment a specialist must have ongoing participation in the Royal Australian College of Radiologists' quality and accreditation program. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of Medicare eligibility to provide MRI services.</p>

<p>Provider eligibility is effective from the date a complete LSPN form is received by the agency or a future date if specified. </p>

<p>All requests for backdating eligibility to perform MRI services are escalated to Provider Services Support via LPS. Provider Services Support forward to the Pathology and Diagnostic Imaging Team.</p>

<p>On receipt of a complete LSPN form from a proprietor or an authorised representative, Service Officers must ensure&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
active MRI equipment is located at the LSPN site</li>
		<li>
the provider names and numbers listed on the form are specialists in radiology with access to Medicare benefits, and</li>
		<li>
the address of the provider location matches the address of the LSPN site</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in the case of hospitals, minor variations in the address are permitted due to hospitals often having multiple entry points. The name of the hospital should however match. </p>

<p>If the provider is eligible link them to the LSPN. The system will automatically add the MRI specialty code 118 to the Provider Stem and Location.</p>

<p>When an MRI provider is linked to the LSPN register, the system will check whether the LSPN address exactly matches the provider location address. If there is a match, the provider location address will be locked and cannot be amended.</p>

<p>The provider location cannot be edited until the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
LSPN address is amended to be different to the provider location, or</li>
		<li>
provider link to the LSPN is end dated</li>
		</ul>
<p>The system is designed to automatically add the MRI specialty code (118) to the Provider Stem and Location if the MRI provider has been linked to the LSPN and the Provider Stem has a current 046 or 047 specification code.</p>

<p>To prevent inappropriate claiming, whenever the specialty codes 046 or 047 are end dated, the specialty code 118 on the provider stem and provider locations will need to be end dated at the same time.</p>

<p>If an MRI provider is unlinked or end dated from an LSPN then the system will end date the 118 at the relevant provider location with the same end date.</p>

<p>A new LSPN is required when a practice changes address. In order to ensure there are no gaps between billing dates, practices are responsible for closing their existing LSPN record and applying for a new LSPN. </p>

<p>Moving levels or suites within the same address is considered a relocation and requires a new LSPN. Practice addresses should only be updated if the practice has not relocated and the request is to correct or provide more detail to the address details.</p>
