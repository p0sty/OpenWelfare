<p>Generally, the CDP provider is responsible for implementing non-vocational interventions. CDP providers may be aware of a CDP participant's circumstances that impact their ability to comply. Before suggesting a change to servicing strategies, consider if the provider has already developed servicing strategies to take into account the CDP participant's circumstances.</p>

<p>The CCA Specialist is responsible for conducting or assisting with crisis interventions.</p>

<p>This step <strong>must be repeated</strong> for each intervention that is being added, updated or reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>Add Intervention</strong></p>

<p>From the drop down list, select who is responsible for the intervention&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Services Australia</li>
		<li>
Provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>Then select the appropriate intervention type and category from the drop down list.</p>

<p><strong>Active interventions or interventions that are no longer required</strong></p>

<p>For a Review CCA, consider if the active intervention/s are still relevant or are no longer required.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For active interventions which are no longer required, select an appropriate outcome reason for the update from the drop down list</li>
		<li>
For active interventions that are still appropriate, no updates are required</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Recording an outcome against an intervention</strong></p>

<p>An outcome must be recorded for any new Services Australia Interventions added. When a Services Australia intervention is added, the CCA Specialist will be alerted that they must record an outcome.</p>

<p>An outcome may be recorded for any other active intervention, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an outcome should be recorded for a provider intervention if the CCA Specialist has had contact with the CDP participant's provider during a CCA and the provider has advised they are unable to implement a specific outcome (for example, they don't have the available funds), or</li>
		<li>
during contact with a provider, the provider indicates they have recently referred the CDP participant to this type of intervention or made the referral during the CCA Specialist contact. In these cases, an intervention outcome of '<strong>referral made</strong>' should be used</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is <strong>not appropriate</strong> to use an intervention outcome of '<strong>referral made</strong>' if a recommendation has been made to the provider but the referral has not been made. The '<strong>referral made</strong>' outcome is recorded by the CDP provider after the CCA has been completed and they have made the appropriate referral.</p>

<p>Intervention outcomes are selected when the intervention is added. See the Resources page of <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030213-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Outcome_codes_a">Completing a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)</a> for intervention outcome codes and recording details.</p>

<p>A maximum of 10 active interventions may be current at any time. Once this limit is reached, the following outcome codes can be used to remove a current active intervention if a more beneficial intervention needs to be added&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'<strong>No longer required</strong>', or</li>
		<li>
'<strong>Created in error</strong>', this should only be used if the intervention is being deleted because it should not have been added in the first place</li>
		</ul>
<p>Before changing an active intervention from a previous CCA, consider the reasons why the intervention was added before ending it.</p>

<p>Once the intervention has been added or updated, select <strong>Save</strong> to confirm the updates.</p>

<p>CCA Specialists are required to review existing circumstances when conducting a CCA. Circumstances with a status of '<strong>yet to assess impact</strong>' must be updated to record the impact on the CDP participant's ability to comply with requirements.</p>

<p>A CCA Specialist (PST SO5) <strong>must</strong> consult with a PST-skilled social worker where the CDP participant presents with family and domestic violence or has a current Family/Domestic violence circumstance recorded.

<p>During a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment, circumstances identified must be supported by an appropriate level of minimum evidence.</p>

<p>The workflow will present a summary of available evidence type(s) able to be selected, based on the type of circumstance under review.</p>

<p>Circumstances created as a result of an ESAt/JCA or Job Seeker Snapshot responses will have the appropriate evidence automatically recorded. See the <a href="../job-seekers/001-10050000-05.html">Resources</a> page for a list of categories and evidence requirements.</p>
