<p>The LAWP only applies to customers applying for Austudy, JSP and YA. The LAWP is between 1 and 13 weeks, applied as 'whole weeks'.</p>

<p>The maximum reserve is the allowable amount of liquid assets a customer can have before the Liquid Assets Test is applied. The maximum reserve amount is used to calculate the LAWP.</p>

<p>The liquid assets maximum reserve&#58;</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessing_loans01">Assessing loans to a private trust or private company and their liquid assets </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) must assess loans to a private trust or private company and their liquid assets, see <a target="_blank" href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05070010-01.html">Identifying and making suitable referrals to the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)</a>. The value of the liquid assets of the private trust or private company for LAWP purposes only, must be assessed based on balances as at the relevant start date of the LAWP, that is, date of claim, date last worked, date studies ended, or date of incapacity. The CAO does <strong>not</strong> need to adjust attributable assets based on the current balance. Where there are significant changes, the CAO should get an updated balance sheet to assess all the entity assets and liabilities as at the date of claim.</p>

<p><strong>Non controllers - loans only</strong></p>

<p>A loan from a non-controller is likely to be an 'at call' loan. That is, the lender can call on the borrowing entity to repay the loan and the borrower is obligated to repay it once a demand is made.</p>

<p>The entity&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
does not need to have enough liquid assets to repay the loan</li>
		<li>
could borrow funds from another source, (for example, a bank) to repay the loan</li>
		<li>
must be able, in principle, to repay the loan to a creditor if, and when, it falls due</li>
		</ul>
<p>The entire amount of the loan is assessed as a liquid asset of the lender. The liquidity of the loan does not take into account the financial position of the borrowing entity.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, the loan may be assessed as a <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04020020-01.html">failed loan</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Controllers with no loan - look at attribution only</strong></p>

<p>The liquid asset amount is assessed using the customer's attribution percentage.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer is a 50% controller of the company</li>
		<li>
The liquid assets of the company are $2,500</li>
		<li>
The customer has 50% attribution of the company</li>
		<li>
The liquid assets amount assessed for the customer is $1,250</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Controllers with a loan</strong></p>

<p>When the entity has liquid assets less than the loan amount, the loan amount is used.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer has a $69,200 loan to the company</li>
		<li>
The customer is a 50% controller of the company</li>
		<li>
The liquid assets of the company are $8,000</li>
		<li>
The net assets of the company are not taken into account</li>
		<li>
The amount assessed for the LAWP for the customer is $69,200</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the entity has liquid assets more than the loan amount, the customer's attributed share is assessed up to the value of the remaining liquid assets.</p>

<p>For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer has a $69,200 loan to the company</li>
		<li>
The customer is a 50% controller of the company</li>
		<li>
The total liquid assets of the company are $80,000</li>
		<li>
The amount to assess for the LAWP is&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the full value of the loan amount of $69,200, and</li>
			<li>
50% of the remaining liquid assets ($80,000 - $69,200 = $10,800 x 50% = $5,400)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The total amount to assess is $74,600</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> no offsetting of bills outstanding, etc. as per the normal LAWP rules/policy.</p>

<p>Where a self-employed customer is holding net Goods and Services Tax (GST) liabilities, these amounts will be exempt when calculating the LAWP.</p>

<p>This means the net liability is the GST collected, less the input tax credits which are deducted from the amount payable to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>

<p>The customer <strong>must</strong> supply evidence of GST registration or the amounts will be included in the calculation of the LAWP.</p>

<p>The customer must supply evidence at the end of the payment quarter that the amount was paid to the ATO. If evidence is not supplied, an overpayment will be raised and debt recovery will start.</p>

<p>It is the customer's responsibility to provide evidence of GST registration if they want their net GST liabilities to be exempt from the LAWP calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> GST liabilities are payable to the ATO 4 times a year. However, businesses can submit their GST liabilities weekly, monthly or as a quarterly payment.

<p>The LAWP start date for Australian Apprentices will be the start of the Australian Apprenticeship.</p>

<p><strong>YA and Austudy students</strong></p>

<p>The LAWP start date for YA and Austudy students is the date they qualify or requalify for payment. This includes the date they start full time studies, meet the YA qualifying age and residency requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Early claims</strong></p>

<p>For students lodging an early claim before starting full-time or approved concessional load studies, the LAWP start date is the Student Start Date if they meet the residency/age requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing/intending students</strong></p>

<p>For continuing/intending students, the LAWP start date will depend on their circumstances. If the student&#58;</p>
