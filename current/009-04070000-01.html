<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Purpose of CP</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CP is an income support payment paid to carers who, because of the demands of their caring role, are unable to support themselves through substantial paid employment.</p>

<p>To be eligible for CP a carer must be providing a significant level of constant care to a child (under 16 years), who needs care permanently or for a minimum period of at least 6 months in most cases.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Disability_Care"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Disability Care Load Assessment Determination (DCLAD)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The DCLAD is used to determine if a child care receiver qualifies a carer for Carer Payment. It comprises a Care Needs Assessment completed by the carer and a medical report completed by a Treating Health Professional (THP).</p>

<p>The criteria used in the assessment do not target particular medical conditions. The tool uses specific questions relating to a broad range of possible care needs that a care receiver may have. It is not necessary for a care receiver's needs to score against all question categories to be eligible for the payment. It is the combination of the scores which determines eligibility for payment.</p>

<p>The care receiver’s language skills, self-care skills, social and community skills, and functional ability are taken into account. Behaviour and special care needs are also examined for the impact they have on the care load. Some elements of the assessment, for example the care receiver’s functional ability, are age adjusted to assess their level of care needs compared to the care needs of other children of a similar age. An additional set of questions are applied to children from 3 years of age to ensure the assessment considers developmental milestones. This process is based on the expert advice of paediatric, medical and allied health professionals from a variety of medical professions who developed the assessment.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Constant_care"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Constant care</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A carer is said to provide constant care if they personally provide care on a daily basis for a significant period during each day. The care may be active, supervisory or monitoring. This includes circumstances where the carer or care receiver is absent from the care situation for part of the day, but the intensity of the care required and provided during the remainder of any 24 hour period is such that it roughly equates to a normal working day.</p>

<p>The assessing Service Officer has the delegation to determine if the constant care provisions are satisfied, based on the medical report and the Care Needs Assessment (CNA) Questionnaire provided with the CP (child) claim. The constant care requirements are usually satisfied if the Treating Health Professional (THP) report and CNA Questionnaire result in a qualifying score for CP, or an assessment of terminal illness unless there are circumstances indicating constant care is not being provided. If there are circumstances that could indicate constant care is not being provided, this can be taken into account in the determination.</p>

<p>The Service Officer needs to consider the care receiver's medical condition(s), the THP score, the CNA score, the THP and carer's responses to the provision of significant care and any other relevant factors. Any inconsistency needs to be considered and in some instances clarified. For example&#58; if the condition is consistent with high THP and CAN scores but the THP report state significant care was not required, we should clarify with the THP why they believe personal care is not required for a significant period on a daily basis. It is possible they have not considered the need for supervision/monitoring. Even if they do not change their views on the need for significant care the delegation rests with the Service Officer.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Constant care rules</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In establishing constant care for child care receivers the following rules apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The carer must be personally providing constant care for any of the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a child under 16 years with a severe disability or severe medical condition</li>
			<li>
a disabled adult and 1 or 2 children with a disability or medical condition (<a href="../carers/009-04070040-01.html">multiple care</a>)</li>
			<li>
2 to 4 children each with a disability or medical condition (<a href="../carers/009-04070030-01.html">combined care</a>)</li>
			<li>
a qualifying child for a one-off period of at least 3 months but less than 6 months (<a href="../carers/009-04070010-01.html">short term care</a>)</li>
			<li>
a qualifying child for a period of at least 3 months but less than 6 months where the child's condition is of an episodic nature and likely to re-occur (<a href="../carers/009-04070020-01.html">episodic care</a>), or</li>
			<li>
child care receivers under the <a href="../carers/009-04070050-01.html">exchanged care provisions</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
The carer advises they provide constant care to the care receiver in their home</li>
		<li>
The Treating Health Professional (THP) indicates on their report that either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the child care receiver requires personal care, due to a severe disability or severe medical cond<i>i</i>tion, for a significant period every day for 6 months or more. If the carer provides care for <strong>more than 1 care receiver</strong>, a response of 'No' or 'not sure' by the THP on the medical report or 'No' response by the carer is not an automatic assessment that constant care is not provided. Consider the total level of care provided to all care receivers. A carer should reasonably be expected to provide at least the equivalent of a normal working day in personal care. Also consider any factors indicating constant care is not being provided.<br>If the carer provides care for <strong>1 care receiver</strong> and there is a response of 'No' or 'not sure' by the THP, on the medical report, consider if constant care is being provided based on the information in the medical report and the CNA Questionnaire. Depending on the circumstances of the individual, clarification may be required from the THP</li>

		<div class="block">

<p>Re-use provisions allow eligible Treating Health Professional (THP) Medical Reports and/or Care Needs Assessments (CNA) previously supplied to be used for a subsequent claim. The online claim and First Contact Service Offer (FCSO) workflow will identify the option to re-use this data for the child care receiver if the most recent reports meet the re-use provisions.</p>

<p>Re-claim provisions allow qualifying THP Medical Reports and CNAs previously supplied to be used for a subsequent claim. Re-claim provisions are automatically assessed when a carer claims online or FCSO is run.</p>
