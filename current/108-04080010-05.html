<p>If both cash and credits in ETS schemes are received, the cash amount is assessed as income.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
ETS are community based schemes where goods and services are exchanged without money</li>
		<li>
ETS schemes have a local unit of exchange, often called an 'eco', but other names for the unit of exchange are also used</li>
		<li>
To be exempt from the Income Test, the scheme has to be an 'approved scheme' under the Act</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Secretary may class an ETS as an 'approved scheme' if all the following are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it is a local community-based system</li>
		<li>
its primary purpose is to help people maintain their labour skills and keep them in touch with the labour market</li>
		<li>
it is not a system run by a person or organisation for profit</li>

<p><strong>Former British Child Migrant Payment</strong></p>

<p>Ex-gratia one-off payments of 20,000 GBP are being made to former British Child Migrants sent from the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) by a church, state, voluntary or other organisation to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Zimbabwe/former Rhodesia. To be eligible, the child migrant must not have been accompanied by an adult family member, or sent to live with a member of their birth family.</p>

<p>These payments are exempt from the income test. However, any ongoing income generated by the lump sum (for example deemed income) will be assessed under the income test, and if used to purchase an assessable asset, the asset will be included in the asset test.</p>

<p><strong>International Agreements - payments exempted</strong></p>

<p>For all Agreements, Australia disregards from the Income Test the social welfare payments (income tested payments) which the Agreement country makes. It is very rare to find any Agreement country paying its social welfare payments to people in Australia.</p>

<p>Most Agreement countries only make such payments to people residing in (and usually present in) their own territory. In those cases, Australia disregards the payments from its Income Test. If cases occur where people in Australia are receiving such payments (whether legally or illegally), they must be disregarded from Australia's Income Test in line with the provisions of the particular Agreement.</p>

<p>Remember that when a pensioner is receiving a pension under the direct deduction provisions of an Agreement, social welfare amounts (although disregarded under the Income Test) are included in the overseas pension amount directly deducted.</p>

<p>Proceeds from forced disposal of livestock are exempted from the income test on the condition that they are (or will be) deposited into a Farm Management Deposit (FMD).

<p>Spousal maintenance is money (or in kind payment) made to a former partner following a divorce or separation. It does not include payments for dependent children. Payments are usually made periodically, but can be received as lump sums. Spousal maintenance is distinct from a property settlement, which is the return of a person's own property.</p>

<p>For the person who receives spousal maintenance from a legally enforceable agreement, the maintenance is <strong>not</strong> assessed as ordinary income under the Income Test for income support purposes. However, it is taken into account under the Maintenance Income Test for family assistance payment purposes.</p>

<p>However, in cases where the arrangement to pay spousal maintenance is not documented in a legally enforceable manner, the gross amount of income is used in assessing the payer's rate of income support. For example, where the only evidence of any arrangement is a verbal agreement or statutory declaration.</p>
