		<ul>		<li>
immediately before leaving Australia, the customer is undertaking full-time or approved concessional load study in an approved course, or is a continuing/intending student</li>
		<li>
students continue to satisfy the YA student qualification criteria</li>
		<li>
Australian Apprentices continue to have a current Commonwealth Registration Number</li>
		<li>
the overseas study or work will contribute to, and be credited towards, a full-time course or apprenticeship in Australia</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a student required, or choosing, to travel overseas to undertake a work placement may continue to receive payment regardless of whether a credit weighting is given. See <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07010060-01.html">Assessing study load requirements</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <strong>do not</strong> refer these cases to CIS.</p>

<p>The customer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
advise their date of departure from Australia, and return date (if known), and</li>
		<li>
provide written advice from their Australian educational institution or State Training Authority confirming proof of the reason for their absence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Generally, a customer who is <strong>studying externally</strong> (for example, by correspondence or online) will not have to attend a campus overseas to complete units of their approved course. However, external students can access extended portability under overseas study provisions if they can demonstrate their primary reason for going overseas is to undertake studies that form part of the course. This could be a residential component at an overseas institution or an overseas work placement if it is part of the Australian course.</p>

<p>YA may only be paid for student exchange programs if the customer stays enrolled and undertakes <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07010010-01.html">an approved course at an approved Australian institution</a>. This is rarely the case for secondary students.</p>

<p>A student or Australian Apprentice granted portability for overseas study or work can continue to receive YA for the duration of the approved absence. The approved study period may include additional travel time to allow them to prepare for the study and/or to finalise their affairs and return to Australia.</p>

receiving YA and undertaking full-time or approved concessional load study in an approved course, or</li>

a continuing/intending student</li>
		</ul>
<p>Continuing students who <strong>lodge a claim</strong> for YA before leaving Australia may start receiving payment after they have left Australia if they are undertaking approved overseas study.</p>

<p>When running the Portability Script - Departures and Returns, it is important to note choosing to assess YA for portability is on the basis the customer meets one of these criteria. If not, do not use the script.</p>

<p>If a non-continuing student (for example, returning to study following a gap year) has recently claimed and will not become qualified and payable until after they leave Australia (for example, due to waiting periods), YA cannot be paid until the customer returns to Australia. Reject claims and advise affected customers as soon as possible so they can change their travel plans if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a new student whose Australian course starts before they leave Australia, and who has claimed YA before they depart, can access overseas study provisions. See the <a>Resources</a> page for examples.</p>

<p>If payment has been made for an approved reason before receipt of evidence, the customer will be required to provide supporting documentation on their return. If the documentation is not acceptable or not provided, a debt will be raised.</p>

<p>When a customer provides supporting documentation to a service centre relating to a previous temporary absence that was not for an approved reason at the time, there is no need to run a request for review as a decision on their portability has not yet been made. Refer the case&#58;</p>

<p>A customer's portability period starts on the day they leave Australia. For portability purposes, a customer is not considered to be inside Australia for any part of the day they departed Australia regardless of the time of departure. If the customer is <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-23053114-03.html">travelling outside Australia on a cruise,</a> the date of departure is the date the ship leaves the last Australian port.</p>

<p>The day a customer returns to Australia is not included as part of their absence as they are considered to be inside Australia on that day (regardless if the time of return) and therefore no longer affected by portability. If they leave and return on the same day, for example airline crew, this is not considered a departure from Australia for portability purposes.</p>

<p>If a customer travelling for an approved reason advises they are departing on a specific date, and departs Australia <strong>more than 3 days before or more than 3 days after</strong> the advised date, any specific negotiated period of portability approved for the original date of departure will cease to apply. The customer's approved reason for travel outside Australia may no longer be valid, and payments will stop when the Immigration Datalink verifies the customer's actual date of departure.</p>

<p>Customers must advise of any change in their departure details prior to travel if they wish to be paid during the absence. Service Officers can assess if the approved reason still applies and record the new departure date and reason again.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The <strong>return rule</strong> for YA means where a customer has been granted an approved overseas study absence, a brief return to Australia (up to 6 weeks) within the approved study period does not interrupt the portability period for the course of study overseas. No new decision is required in such cases.</p>

<p>However, if a student or Australian Apprentice studying or working overseas decides to extend the length of their overseas course or work (for example, wants to continue studying overseas for an extra semester) the customer must apply to have their payment continue and provide new supporting evidence.</p>

<p>For approved reasons other than overseas study, customers unable to return to Australia by the end of the specific negotiated period should contact CIS or their payment will stop. If more time overseas is required, this can be discussed and any approved absence possibly extended up to the maximum portability period. However, if they are still unable to return to Australia for a reason other than an approved reason (for example, they are hospitalised), there is <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01050000-01.html">discretion to extend the period of portability</a> under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a customer leaves or returns to Australia. The system assesses portability of the payment, regardless whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled.</p>

<p>Services Australia uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Department of Home Affairs. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. The agency must consider applying the alternative dates if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>In many cases, customers do <strong>not</strong> have to advise the agency if they are leaving Australia temporarily, or have returned from a temporary absence.</p>

<p>However, there are particular circumstances where customers must advise of a departure before leaving Australia or contact when they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> In most cases, customers can notify of their departure from Australia via the <a href="../self-service/133-04150030-01.html">Travelling outside of Australia service</a> within their Centrelink online account. Where a customer's circumstances are more complex, they must contact the agency.</p>

<p>If the customer is the principal carer of a dependent child (or children) and that child (or all dependent children) leaves Australia, it can affect the customer's entitlement. It may also have an impact on the mutual obligations requirements that apply to the customer.</p>

<p>If the child goes overseas to live in another country, the customer will cease to be the principal carer for that child immediately on the child's departure, as they are no longer a dependent child. Any payment or concession paid to the customer for the care for the child will cease on the departure date. The customer's Job Plan may need reviewing with this change in carer status.</p>

<p>If a child leaves Australia temporarily or was born outside Australia, the customer will generally still be regarded as the principal carer for up to 6 weeks, even if the customer remains in Australia.</p>

<p>A person cannot be the principal carer of any child who has been outside Australia for more than 6 weeks unless the customer is outside Australia with that child and they are still entitled to the social security payment they were receiving when they left Australia (that is, the customer's maximum portability period has not ceased).</p>

<p>If a customer has ceased to be the principal carer of a child because they have been outside Australia for more than 6 weeks and the child returns to Australia for less than 6 weeks before going overseas again, the customer will cease to be the principal carer of that child for the entire period of the later absence.</p>

<p>If a customer has been granted YA under the New Zealand 10 year residence exemption their payment cannot be restored on return to Australia if there is any gap between the date of suspension/cancellation and the date of restoration. If payment is granted for a restricted portability reason for the whole period of travel, payment <strong>can</strong> be restored. As this exemption can only be used once, the customer will not be able to be re-granted YA again under this exemption.</p>
