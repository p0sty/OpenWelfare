<p>Annual reviews of SDTs occur each year, regardless of whether the trust holds any assets other than the settled sum or not. This is a legislative requirement and cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>When the annual review matures, a letter will be sent to the nominated contact of the SDT to request&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Financial statements</li>
		<li>
Tax return (if lodged) </li>
		<li>
Statutory declaration(s) from all trustee(s), and </li>
		<li>
Donor Register (if new contributions have been made) </li>
		</ul>
<p>After 35 days, a <strong>TACSDR</strong> reminder letter issues to the contact (as well as all other linked parties) to request the financial statements and highlight the non-lodgement of the review.</p>

<p>After a further 28 days, a second <strong>TACSDR</strong> reminder letter is issued to the contact and all linked parties.</p>

<p>Has a customer contacted regarding the annual review?</p>

If person is calling or attending to query the 28 day time limit mentioned in the letters, advise that the annual review documents need only to be supplied by 31 March.

If contact is to advise that the requested financial statements will not be available to lodge by 31 March, send a <strong>Fast Note</strong> for the Service Reason of <strong>TRF </strong>- Trust and Company, auto text category Complex Assessment and CAO Special Disability Trust template. Request for CAO action&gt; CAO Special Disability Trust. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> CAO intervention is requested to waive late lodgement of the financial statements and the reasons for the delay given by the customer</li>
			<li>

			<li>
If the trust contact attends a service centre with the annual SDT review documents, scan the letter and any associated financial documentation to the trust record. Select the SDT review activity from the FAL screen</li>		</ul>

<p>Consider whether a waiver would be appropriate in each case, depending on the circumstances and if the delay was out of the trustee’s control. For example, illness or delays caused by accountant.</p>

<p>If the delay is due to the inaction or action of the trustee it may not be possible to issue a waiver, especially if this has occurred in multiple years. Ensure contact with the trustee(s) before any action or decision to deem the trust non-compliant. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the financial statements (and tax return if one is lodged) are not available for reasons outside the trustee's control, and no other waiver has already been issued for the financial year, extend the review period for up to the maximum 3 month period (or as long as required by the trustee)</li>
		<li>
Issue the waiver letter after discussion with the trustee and document on the trust record. Ensure the review activity is held for the return of the information, and the trustee is aware the trust may be deemed non-complying if the requested information or documents are not returned by the due date</li>

<p>A failure by the trustee to meet the annual reporting requirements is in breach of S1209s of the Social Security Act 1991 and may cause the trust to become non-compliant. </p>

<p>If there has been no contact from the trustee or action to rectify the non-provision of documents, the SDT must be vested and reassessed under regular trust and company rules.

<p>Examine the financial statements to determine if the trust still complies with SDT conditions and the funds have been used primarily for the care and accommodation needs of the beneficiary.</p>

<p>If there has been a high or increased level of expenses, further investigation may be required to ensure the trustee is complying with the spending guidelines and that all expenditure is for the beneficiary’s use or enjoyment.</p>

<p>The specific rules governing SDT’s and liabilities are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
There should not be any loans, either to or from an SDT and the principal beneficiary or a related party. If any liabilities appear on the balance sheet, it will require investigation and the trust may be non-compliant</li>
		<li>
The only exception for related parties is where they are awaiting reimbursement for costs incurred on behalf of the trust and listed as creditors. These should be short term in nature and <strong>not</strong> carry from one financial year to the next </li>
		<li>
The trustee <strong>must not allow</strong> trust property to be used as security for loans or debts of the beneficiary, their partner, or any third party </li>
		<li>
There are no waivers for borrowing, and if not able to be readily rectified the trust will lose its SDT status from the date of the transaction</li>		</ul>

<p>Waivers allow time for the trustee to take action to rectify and comply with SDT requirements. There are limitations as to when and how long a waiver can be given.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
inappropriate expenditure - a waiver can be given, under section 1209N of the Social Security Act, having regard to the degree, frequency of noncompliance and the circumstances under which it occurred. A waiver can only be given if the total noncompliant expenditure in a financial year, including any excess of the discretionary spending limit, is no more than $5,000 of that limit. <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04070070-05.html#bp05_L2GT_01">Resources</a> has a list of current and historical discretionary spending limits</li>
		<li>
a waiver can be given for a delay in providing financial statements under section 1209S of the Social Security Act, if the delay is not due to the actions or inactions of the trustee for a period <strong>no more than 3 months</strong> following 31 March from the relevant tax year</li>
		<li>
where the expenditure is due to <strong>fraudulent</strong> behaviour a waiver cannot be given</li>
		</ul>
<p>Except for waivers relating to late lodgement of financial statements, the delegate can extend the waiver for an additional 3 month maximum period, up to a total of twelve months, if the delay is not due to the actions or inactions of the trustee.</p>

<p>Contributions from the beneficiary or their partner outside the 3 years limitation may be waived where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
transfer of the asset to the trust was delayed as a result of court proceedings relating to the asset</li>
		<li>
assets were previously transferred to a trust intended to be a Special Disability Trust, or</li>
		<li>
intention was to transfer the assets within the allowable three year time frame</li>
		</ul>
<p>Delegate for the waiver notice is the EL2 Director in the Income Support Means Test team. Email a completed template to Income Support Means Test.</p>

<p>For trusts existing <strong>before 1 January 2011</strong> that are protective and unable to vary their Deed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>All</strong> trustees must provide an additional statutory declaration that they will comply with the requirements of a Special Disability Trust</li>

<p>A waiver notice can be issued for a period up to 12 months, that is, until the following 31 &#160;March, to align with the annual reporting requirements.</p>
