<p>Check the customer’s record to ensure the estimate will be a valid option&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Estimate elections must be made by the customer</strong> who the estimate is for. The only exception is if the estimate is made by a person with legal power of attorney or other legal authority to act for the customer. See <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/6/3/6">The Child Support Guide 6.3.6</a> </li>
		<li>
<strong>a current Stage 2 child support assessment must be in place</strong>. This procedure does not apply to <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-05060000-01.html">Stage 1 cases</a>. If a Stage 1 case is in place where a court order or a court-registered agreement has set the amount for child maintenance, spousal maintenance or de facto maintenance, the estimate is invalid. After processing the estimate, assist customer with <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-05050000-01.html">Stage 1 – low-income non-enforcement (LINE) period</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>there is no Income Amount Order</strong> (IAO) in force relating to the estimating parent on the day of the election or for any part of the remainder of the financial year. An IAO is where a Child Support Agreement, Change of Assessment (COA) decision, Court Order or assessment from another country varies the assessment by <strong>setting</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
annual rate of child support payable (setting the annual rate/a periodic amount), or</li>
			<li>
customer’s adjusted taxable income or child support income </li>
			<li>
<strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a customer cannot lodge an estimate as an IAO is in force, consider if a COA application may be appropriate and check for an unemployment clause in an agreement or a Court Order that could be invoked</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>the income for the financial year being used for the assessment</strong> at the time of the initial estimate, must be one of the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
an Australian Taxation Office (ATO) taxable income (including amended taxable incomes)</li>
			<li>
an <a href="../separated-parents/277-19070503-01.html">Income Tax Declaration (ITD)</a>, or </li>
			<li>
an income advised by an overseas authority. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07030000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers (international parents)</a> &#160;</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>the</strong> <strong>first estimate election must be 85% or less</strong> than the adjusted taxable income (ATI) used in the child support assessment. The <strong>final determination</strong> about whether an estimate meets the 85% validity rule will be made when the estimate details have been confirmed and keyed in the system. However, if it becomes apparent during these early checks that the estimates may <strong>not</strong> meet this rule, manage the customer expectations about the estimate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Does the estimate appear to be valid?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes </strong>(or not yet confirmed), <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Estimate_receiv_Step06">go to Step 6</a>. The final determination of validity will be made <strong>after</strong> the estimate election is fully confirmed and processed</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, the estimate is clearly invalid. For&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a verbal estimate election, tell the customer the estimate may be invalid. Go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Key_the_estimat">Table 5</a> to key the estimate details. Once the system confirms the estimate is invalid, explain the reason and any other available options to the customer</li>
			<li>
an online/written estimate election, go <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Customer_contac">Table 4</a> to discuss validity issues</li>
			<li>
an estimate not lodged by the customer (or someone with legal authority to act for the customer), do not record or pend an estimate. Tell the person requesting the estimate that no further action can be taken unless the customer or person with legal authority to act contacts. Note the request in the Communication window.

<p>Check if the CSPs match for the reverse cases, in all periods affected by estimates. For estimates to align on reverse cases, the CSPs must align throughout the entire financial year of the estimate(s). If CSPs are different or missing, error messages may occur that prevent estimates applying correctly to reverse cases. These alignment issues usually relate to a CSP being&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cut short because one Cuba case ended when the reverse Cuba case commenced</li>
		<li>
missing and is required for the estimate period (this will usually relate to a CSP that ran before the start date of the reverse role), or</li>

incorrect. For example, started with an incorrect date on one of the reverse cases</li>

<p><strong>Identify</strong> all the estimate entries not applied (or that do not exactly match) in <strong>each</strong> of the reverse cases for all estimates, CLI amended estimates and CSA amended estimates.</p>

		<li>
take copies of the original notepad from each estimate and amended estimate. These can be added to the records applied on the reverse case, in addition to the Correcting Errors submission notepad</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some estimates on a reverse case may not be missing but recorded incorrectly. For example, with an incorrect start date or with a different estimated income amount. Both the start date and the income amount must match exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Delete</strong> the incorrectly recorded estimates, and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
open a new Estimate Income window to key the missing estimate/s or re-key an estimate that needed correction. Ensure the dates, details and amounts of each estimate/amended estimate on the reverse cases exactly match</li>
		<li>
even if a reverse case starts and/or ends on a different date, <strong>the estimate details, including the start date of the estimate, must still exactly match on each case</strong>. The child support system will only allow this if the CSPs are <strong>aligned</strong> before recording the estimates. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; each time an estimate is recorded the CSPs must be realigned. This is because Cuba automatically saves eligibility and removes the CSPs added when each estimate is recorded</li>
		<li>
add the Correcting errors submission notepad and a copy of the relevant estimate notepad on the original case, to <strong>each</strong> added estimate entry. Add a note stating ‘As per the Error correction submission notepad, this estimate is being keyed to align estimate records on reverse cases. The original estimate notepad is copied below'.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check the status of the newly added estimate entry&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an estimate entry for dates after a reverse case ended will have a status of <strong>Recorded</strong>. This is correct as that estimate entry would not be directly used in the assessment for that case number. However, that entry will still be used to ensure a correct reconciliation result for other estimates in that same financial year</li>
		<li>
an estimate entry which applies to a period the case was active, may show as <strong>Recorded</strong>. Run <strong>Eligibility</strong> and <strong>Save</strong> so Cuba applies these estimate entries to the assessment. After eligibility is run, the estimate status updates to <strong>Currently Used</strong></li>
		<li>
an estimate entry which was added to a reverse case with a start date before that case role commenced will have a status of <strong>Currently Used</strong>. If a subsequent estimate is added that also has a start date before the case role commenced, the status of the preceding estimate will update to <strong>Revoked</strong>, and the subsequent estimate will have a status of <strong>Currently Used</strong></li>

		<li>
<strong>the first date of a new Child Support Period (CSP)</strong> if notified on/before that date. For example, a new CSP using a higher income is due to start on 1 August. The customer calls in July and elects to start their estimate from the CSP start date (1 August)</li>
		<li>

			<ul>			<li>
a Cuba document or a call recording confirms that the customer notified Child Support of a change in income, asked to lodge an estimate and Child Support failed to action the request. The estimate must be pended and the intray forwarded to an APS5 or above for approval, or</li>
			<li>
the customer's circumstances satisfies an <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Estimate_Deemin">estimate deeming policy</a> criteria to backdate the estimate start date. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; SSO approval is not required when applying a deeming policy.

<p><strong>End Date</strong></p>

<p><strong>All </strong>estimates of income must be made for a period ending <strong>30 June </strong>in the financial year they apply to. </p>

<p>If the <strong>case ends before 30 June</strong>, discuss possible effects as the estimate <strong>continues</strong> until 30 June.

<p>No matter what the financial year of an overseas country is, overseas estimated income must be provided for the<strong> Australian financial year from 1 July to 30 June</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is overseas income included in the estimate, check if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has an Australian administrative assessment in place. If not, the estimate will be made invalid when processed</li>
		<li>
is currently an Australian resident or if they are an overseas resident. This will affect how the overseas income is recorded</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the residency information recorded in Cuba does not match other information provided by the customer, a <a href="../separated-parents/277-08310000-01.html">Residency decision</a> may be required by a specialist Residency Service Officer.</p>

<p><strong>Currency conversion</strong></p>

<p>Customers must provide estimated overseas income amounts in the currency it was/will be received. The overseas currency must then be converted to Australian Dollars before being recorded in Cuba. To convert the income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
use the same average exchange rate for the relevant financial year of the country as was used in calculating the original taxable income</li>
		<li>
use the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Macros">International Income Converter</a> macro to determine the exchange rate that was in place at the time, if this is not documented in the Income notepad</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the currency or the year to be converted is not available on the International Income Converter, email the &#160;International Disbursement Team for the required exchange rate.</p>

<p><strong>Target Foreign Income in the estimate</strong></p>

<p>Convert the income manually using the exchange rate available on 1 July of the relevant Australian financial year and round off to the nearest whole dollar. To request the required exchange rate, email the &#160;International Disbursement Team.</p>

<p><strong>Overseas residents</strong></p>

<p>When recording an estimate for an overseas resident in Cuba, the <strong>Type</strong> of estimate selected should be <strong>OS EST INCOME</strong>. The estimate should include all income that is taxable under the legislation of the relevant overseas country or countries. Include any relevant Australian Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI).</p>

<p>In specific circumstances, a Receiving Parent who is resident in a non-reciprocating jurisdiction may still be eligible for a child support assessment. If a receiving parent is a resident of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction and is lodging an estimate, record any income from that country as <strong>Target Foreign Income</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Australian residents</strong></p>

<p>If an Australian resident has an overseas income source, include this in their estimate as <strong>Target Foreign Income</strong>. Ensure it meets the <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/4/10#taxable_income">Child Support income</a> type definition.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence required for overseas estimates</strong></p>

<p>Ask the estimating customer for evidence of their overseas income.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; evidence of New Zealand income is not normally required as this can be requested from New Zealand Inland Revenue. Only Service Support Officers (SSOs) can accept an estimate based on overseas income without evidence. </p>

<p>Evidence must be for <strong>income in the Australian financial year from 1 July to 30 June</strong> such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a tax assessment copy issued by the relevant country’s taxation authority</li>
		<li>
an employment termination certificate</li>
		<li>
a letter from the employer with YTD income</li>
		<li>
certification from employers such as a payment summary equivalent or payslips</li>
		<li>
a relevant government authority statement showing payments made to the customer, or</li>
		<li>
documentation from an accountant or tax agent</li>
		</ul>
<p>Supplying evidence is <strong>not</strong> a legislative requirement and is not a sole reason to refuse the estimate. However, if the parent has not supplied evidence, Child Support may refuse the estimate if satisfied the actual income is likely to be more.</p>

<p><strong>Request Amended Certificate</strong></p>

<p>When an estimate is taken for an International case, notification must be sent to the overseas authority so they are aware of the change made to the assessment. To request an amended certificate for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
New Zealand&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
create a <strong>NZ IN REQ ACERT FROM NZIR</strong> intray</li>
			<li>

<p>If the estimate <strong>starts on 1 July</strong>, a YTD income is <strong>not</strong> required, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Taking_or_check_Step06">go to Step 6</a>.</p>

<p>If the estimate starts after 1 July, explain the importance of YTD. The YTD income is the total income from 1 July to the day before the estimate starts. It is important that the YTD is correct as it will be used to check the accuracy of the estimate at the end of the year. An incorrect YTD may result in the customer paying or receiving the incorrect amount of child support. It may result in an unexpected debt when the estimate is reconciled.</p>

<p>Ask about <strong>all relevant income types in the YTD period</strong>. <strong>All </strong>the relevant income components of ATI must be included in the YTD period, as outlined in <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/4/10">The Child Support Guide 2.4.4.10 Adjusted Taxable Income</a>. </p>

<p>Check that the customer has included income in the YTD period from&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all<strong> </strong>employers (include current employer <strong>and</strong> all previous employers)</li>
		<li>
all businesses they received income from</li>
		<li>
any relevant Centrelink or DVA payments</li>
		<li>
any taxable termination payments received </li>
		<li>
any taxable superannuation withdrawals </li>
		</ul>
<p>Also check that<strong> all allowable deductions </strong>have been taken into account.</p>

<p>Customers may advise of one off lump sum payments in the YTD period (termination payments, superannuation withdrawals, commissions or bonuses). Only include payments that form part of ATI. Customers may need to check with their employer, accountant or the ATO to confirm if their lump sum payment(s) are tax free, partially taxable or fully taxable.</p>

<p><strong>Payments that cannot be included</strong></p>

<p>If customers include National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), National Redress Scheme, First Home Super Saver Scheme or Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme (ongoing or lump sum) as an income source, document in a notepad for information only. <strong>Do</strong> <strong>not include</strong> in any calculations, as they are <strong>not</strong> considered as income for Child Support purposes.</p>

<p><strong>YTD of $0</strong></p>

<p>If the customer lodges a $0 YTD income, check this is accurate. Ask how the customer supported themselves during the YTD period.</p>

<p><strong>Request evidence</strong></p>

<p>If unsatisfied with the YTD accuracy, encourage customers to provide evidence of their claims as this helps to ensure the YTD amounts are correct. If required, request evidence within 14 days. Explain that if evidence is not received, the decision will be based on the information available. Evidence includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an employment termination certificate</li>
		<li>
payslips</li>
		<li>
a letter from employer with YTD</li>
		<li>
a statement of benefit from Centrelink (if this information is not available on the External Information window in Cuba), or</li>
		<li>
a provisional profit and loss statement (tell the customer they could be charged by their accountant for requesting this)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the evidence indicates the estimate or YTD is not reasonably accurate, the customer can withdraw or amend their election. If Child Support is satisfied that the YTD income has been <strong>overstated,</strong> the estimate can be refused.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; only in exceptional circumstances, if the customer cannot provide their YTD ATI information, consider issuing an s161 notice to the employer to request the information. For example, customer is incarcerated.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping the YTD accurate</strong></p>

<p>Customers can update or correct the YTD ATI provided in their initial estimate any time before estimate reconciliation. Only Child Support Service Officers can update a YTD after estimate reconciliation. </p>

<p><strong>Updating a YTD</strong></p>

<p>Has the customer contacted only to update a YTD in a previously accepted estimate?</p>

		<li>
the remainder of the financial year (if starting after 1 July)</li>

<p>Also check that <strong>all allowable deductions</strong> have been taken in to account.</p>

<p><strong>Payments that cannot be included</strong></p>

<p>If customers include National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), National Redress Scheme, First Home Super Saver Scheme or Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme (ongoing or lump sum) as an income source, document in a notepad for information only. <strong>Do</strong> <strong>not include</strong> in any calculations, as they are <strong>not</strong> considered as income for Child Support purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Payment frequency </strong></p>

<p>Customers can provide their ATI as periodic amounts (weekly, fortnightly, monthly) or as one off (lump sum) amounts. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; customers may elect to provide their ATI components as single amounts, such as taxable income $32,400 per annum plus reportable fringe benefits of $8,700 per annum. Do not refuse the estimate for missing employer name/payment frequency details. For customers who insist on providing their ATI components as single amounts, apply a workaround. Tell the customer that to record their estimate election, the taxable income will be recorded as a weekly amount. Document the income component was provided as a single amount and recorded as weekly to enable loading to the system. Document any calculations. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-04.html">The Child Support Guide 2.5.1&#58; Income estimates for a year of income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping the estimate accurate</strong></p>

<p>A notice will be sent requiring the customer to inform Child Support of any change in their circumstances within 14 days (60 days for international customers). Customers need to tell Child Support as soon as possible of any event that affects the accuracy of the estimate. Penalties may apply if a customer underestimates their income.</p>

<p>Tell the customer that if they elect to estimate their income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the assessment will be calculated on income they expect to earn from the start of the estimate to the end of the financial year</li>
		<li>
they must notify Child Support of any changes to their income during the financial year</li>
		<li>
the estimate will be reconciled after the end of the financial year and if the estimate is not accurate, this could result in&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a child support debt. If a debt is raised when the estimate is auto reconciled as a result of tax lodgement, their tax refund will be automatically intercepted and applied to the debt</li>
			<li>
estimate penalties (for underestimated amounts)</li>

<p>When taking a subsequent estimate, all previous estimates must be checked for 2 types of payments that Cuba treats as a lump sum&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
One Off Payments which are generally payments made on a single date. Examples include a termination payment, bonus, commission, super withdrawal</li>
		<li>
Specific Period Payments, when a customer advises they will receive payments for a <strong>specific period</strong> that will end before 30 June. For example, a contract for $850 per week for the period 1 November 2022 – 31 March 2023</li>
		</ul>
<p>When first included in an estimate, lump sum and specific period payments are automatically applied evenly across all the days in the remaining estimate period, up to 30 June. The whole amount will be included in the total estimated income expected over a year. However, if a subsequent customer or Child Support amended estimate is accepted from a later date, a portion of the previous lump sum or specific period payments will no longer be included in the total income expected. This may result in an unexpected debt when the estimate is reconciled. Manual action can be taken to include these amounts. This manual action is called <strong>Lump Sum Apportionment</strong>.</p>

<p>Were there any lump sums or specific period payments in any previous estimate?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, tell the customer they can carry the <strong>unused portion</strong> of those earlier payments into their subsequent estimate. This may prevent an unexpected debt when the estimate is reconciled. To calculate the amount to carry forward into the subsequent estimate, use the Lump Sum Apportionment Calculator. Use ‘Save As’ workaround to download/use calculator. </li>

<p>Review the customer’s circumstances and the estimate submitted to assess if lodging an estimate is suitable for the customer. This is important if the customer's income varies during the financial year. </p>

<p><strong>Other options</strong> could be more suitable for the customer’s circumstances, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not lodging an estimate, or</li>
		<li>
applying for&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
post separation income (PSI) to be excluded from the assessment in certain circumstances. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-01.html">Post separation income for Child Support parents</a></li>
			<li>
a Fixed Annual Rate (FAR) not to apply. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-01.html">Fixed annual rate not to apply applications</a></li>
			<li>
a Minimum Rate (MR) not to apply. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03100000-01.html">Minimum Annual Rate to nil – Reducing Child Support assessments,</a> or </li>
			<li>
a Change of Assessment (COA) in special circumstances. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120000-01.html">Change of assessment in special circumstances</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Consider the potential impacts of lodging an estimate and the process (of reviews and reconciliation), especially for cases that are ending. Lodging an estimate may result in an outcome that is different to what the customer expected. For example, the assessment may become higher than a PP expected or lower than an RP expected.</p>

<p>When checking for suitability, if the customer indicates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are <strong>not working</strong>, check&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
their industry for regular working patterns, such as those that periodically close (such as meat workers) or are seasonal (such as shearers, fruit picking)</li>
			<li>
how confident they are of finding other work soon </li>
			<li>
if a work injury prevents them from working</li>		</ul>
		<li>
they have <strong>reduced overtime</strong> or <strong>work hours</strong>, check if the&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
earnings will be significantly less this year</li>
			<li>
reduced overtime will be in place until the end of the financial year</li>
			<li>
change to normal working hours is permanent or long term</li>
			<li>
increased working hours are likely to be in the short term only</li>		</ul>
		<li>
they receive or may apply for <strong>Centrelink benefits</strong>, check if the customer is&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
confident of finding other work soon </li>
			<li>
likely to increase their working hours in the short term</li>		</ul>
		<li>
their assessment is based on a higher than usual <strong>ATI </strong>(for example,<strong> due to one-off payment</strong>), check&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
capital gains in last tax return or eligible termination payment in last tax return</li>
			<li>
be aware the other party may apply for a COA to have this one-off payment taken into consideration for the assessment. Explain this to the customer</li>
			<li>
if a lower tax return for the next year will be lodged soon</li>		</ul>
		<li>
they have <strong>started self-employment</strong>, check&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the customer has secured contracts to support their business</li>
			<li>
how the customer will pay themselves</li>
			<li>
how the customer has calculated their income. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; be aware the other party may apply for a COA to have business income, property and financial resources taken into consideration for the assessment. Explain this to the customer (or for non-verbal estimate elections, make a note)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
they have <strong>reduced self-employment income</strong>, check&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
how the customer has calculated their income</li>
			<li>
how soon they expect business to financially improve </li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>An estimate <strong>may not be the most suitable option</strong> where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Customer has advised of a potentially fraudulent ATO income being used</strong>. In most cases the estimate will be cancelled, if&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the sole reason for the estimate is that the customer believes the ATO income being used in the assessment is potentially fraudulent, <strong>and</strong> </li>
			<li>
the ATO income is later cancelled</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> contact the customer if they made an estimate election and the estimate was compared to (for the purposes of the 85% validity test) the now-cancelled income. Tell them the assessment will now be based on the income replacement rules for cancelled incomes</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a <strong>new Child Support Period (CSP) will start</strong>. For example, the customer is about to lodge a tax return which will trigger a new CSP and this income is lower than the estimated income. The customer can still estimate their income, however the assessment will not revert to using the Last Relevant Year of Income (LYRI) until the end of the estimate period</li>
		<li>
<strong>contract or seasonal work</strong> result in income fluctuations during the financial year and the customer expects their taxable income to be similar to the ATI used in their assessment</li>
		<li>
a <strong>recently unemployed</strong> customer expects to obtain <strong>new employment</strong> within a short period with income similar to, or more than, the relevant ATI</li>
		<li>
a <strong>redundancy payout or lump sum payment</strong> is expected from another source. Explain the taxable component of the lump sum will be included in their estimated ATI if received during the estimate period and the consequences if this occurs. Tell the customer they have the option of lodging the estimate after the lump sum is received</li>
		<li>
the <strong>child support case ends before 30 June</strong>. Customers may prefer to avoid estimate reconciliation and potential retrospective changes after their case ends as outlined in <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Taking_or_check_Step02">Step 2 in Table 3</a> </li>
		<li>
there is a <strong>history of multiple/inaccurate estimates</strong>. Underestimating can create future debt(s) and penalties may also apply. Check the Client Benefits, Income Details &#160;and External Information windows, Cuba record and Australian Taxation Office (ATO) systems (for employment declarations). Check, clarify and if required, request evidence to support the estimate accuracy</li>		</ul>

multiple online estimates have been received and it is unclear which estimate/s are intended to be used</li>
				<li>
the customer has lodged more than 3 estimates within 3 months </li>

the estimate is for zero but the reason for the estimate is a new job or Centrelink payments </li>
				<li>
there is a lump sum or specific period payment in a previous estimate that may require lump sum apportionment</li>
				<li>
the estimate contains overseas income</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>The estimate requires evidence</strong>. For example&#58;</li>

an overseas estimate is being lodged for a country other than New Zealand</li>

		<li>
<strong>Effective (Start) Date</strong> is the date the estimate affects the assessment. This date auto-populates. For an initial estimate, this is usually the date the election was made.

<p><strong>YTD ATI</strong></p>

<p>Cuba will display a message if the YTD ATI provided by the customer is zero or greater than the expected YTD by 10% or more. The 'expected YTD' is calculated by pro-rating the LRYI for the days between the start of the financial year and the day before the estimate start date. If the YTD ATI is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
zero and the start date of the election is&#58;</li>

not 1 July, confirm that the zero is correct </li>		</ul>
		<li>
10% higher than expected, confirm that the amount is correct</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>85% rule</strong></p>

<p>The annualised amount of the first estimate election must be 85% or less of the customer’s ATI for the LRYI. Cuba performs the 85% validity check against the LRYI used in the assessment. Cuba will display a message after <strong>Calculate</strong> is selected. If the estimate is greater than 85% of the LRYI, confirm with the customer that the amount provided is correct. If the amount is correct, the estimate will be made invalid, go to <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_decision_a_Step06">Step 1 in Table 6</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Annual Rate (FAR) or Minimal Annual Rate (MAR)</strong></p>

<p>Cuba will display a message if an estimate leads to a FAR or MAR assessment. Customers can make an application for <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-01.html">FAR not to apply</a> or <a href="../separated-parents/277-03100000-01.html">MAR to be reduced to nil</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Case(s) ends before the end of the estimate period</strong></p>

<p>Cuba will display a message if a case is expected to end during the financial year. This is to prompt the Service Officer to discuss the matter with the customer. Tell the customer that all the income earned within the financial year will be included in the <a href="../separated-parents/277-07060000-01.html">estimate reconciliation</a>, even the amount that is earned after the case ends.</p>

<p>For example, customer’s case will end 15 November 2021. They lodge an estimate of income on 1 October 2021. The customer has an increase to their income between the end date of their case (15 November 2021) and the end of the financial year (30 June 2022). The customer will be unable to lodge a subsequent estimate after 15 November to reflect their increased income. The estimate will still be reconciled based on the taxable income for the full 2021/2022 financial year (Actual ATI). The reconciling income will be applied for the period the estimate was used in the assessment until the case ends (1 October 2021 to 15 November 2021).</p>

		</ul>
<p>A Service Officer may become satisfied the actual ATI is likely to be higher or that the YTD is likely to be lower&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
if there are unclarified discrepancies. The estimate may include inconsistent information that cannot be clarified by the customer or from available information (via evidence obtained, ATO system searches or Cuba searches). This may include&#58;</li>

errors in the estimate calculation </li>
			<li>
errors in the number of days in the remaining period, or</li>
			<li>
the customer refusing to provide required information</li>		</ul>
		<li>
where there is a dispute over assessable income and allowable deductions. Although Service Officers cannot determine amounts that are assessable or deductible for tax purposes, some amounts are not assessable or deductible in any circumstance. For example child support payments are not allowable deductions for tax purposes in Australia. If there is reason to believe that the actual ATI is likely to be higher than the estimated income, refuse the estimate election</li>
		<li>
if a customer cannot adequately substantiate their reason for making an election, and if satisfied that their actual income is likely to be higher than the estimate, refuse their estimate. For example. if a customer says they have lost their job but not receiving unemployment benefits, ask&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
why they are not receiving benefits</li>
			<li>
how they plan to support themselves while unemployed</li>
			<li>
for their termination certificate or other evidence of the resources available to them. If there is a doubt the customer has ceased employment, check with the previous employer. If satisfied the actual income is likely to be more than the estimated income, refuse the estimate</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the ability to refuse an estimate election is not limited to the circumstances above.</p>

<p>If an estimate election is refused, it is taken to have never been made and the customer is able to lodge a new estimate at any time.
