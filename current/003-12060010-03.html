<p>The point in time assessment would apply in very limited circumstances. The customer <strong>must meet all of the qualification criteria for CrP-EXV</strong>.

<p>The customer will qualify if&#58;</p>

they were forced to return to the home where the family and domestic violence circumstances occurred due to financial hardship; and</li>

at the time of claim it was unreasonable for the customer to be expected to remain in or return to the home; and</li>
