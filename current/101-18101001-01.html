<p>ParentsNext is a pre-employment program for Parenting Payment (PP) (single and partnered) customers with children under 6 years of age. This may include grandparents or foster parents receiving PP. The program focuses on offering individual support and referrals to services that can help customers to plan and prepare for work or connect to the workforce when their youngest child turns 6.</p>

<p>ParentsNext participants are not required to look for or take up work. The aim is to encourage customers to think about their future work and study related goals and to support them in achieving these goals by connecting them with appropriate services in their local community. The program offers individualised support that can include assistance to access secure housing, financial advice, parenting courses, childcare, transport, further study, training or volunteering.</p>

<p>Taking part in ParentsNext is voluntary. Customers selected for ParentsNext will be invited to attend an initial appointment with Services Australia and will be referred to a ParentsNext provider.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_ParentsNext_his">ParentsNext history</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>ParentsNext has operated since April 2016 with the first model limited to 10 Local Government Areas (LGA).</p>

<p>From July 2018 ParentsNext operated nationally, in all non-remote areas of Australia in two streams. The Intensive stream was delivered in 30 locations (67 LGAs) and the Targeted stream encompassed all other non-remote Employment Regions nationally. There was different eligibility criteria between the two streams resulting in customer's being required to participate at different stages depending on their circumstances and the age of their youngest PP child.</p>

<p>From July 2021, the ParentsNext program was enhanced so that eligibility criteria is applied consistently across Australia removing the need for the Targeted and Intensive streams. This ensures customers are selected for ParentsNext and receive assistance based on their vulnerabilities and not their location.</p>

<p>On 5 May 2023 the Government announced that ParentsNext will be replaced by a new voluntary service to commence after 1 July 2024. Until this time, the program will continue to operate without compulsory participation requirements, The Department of Social Services agreed to remove compulsory fortnightly reporting for ParentsNext participants where the only reason they were reporting was due to being in the program. Customers will not be required to report to Services Australia on a fortnightly basis unless they or their partner (if partnered) are declaring income.</p>

<p><strong>ParentsNext Interim Arrangements from 1 October 2023</strong></p>

<p>Customers will continue to be selected for ParentsNext using the compulsory eligibility criteria. Customers who are selected will display as compulsory in the system however they do not have compulsory participation requirements.</p>

<p>At the Services Australia ParentsNext appointment, Service Officers are to discuss the benefits of the ParentsNext program with the customer and book them an appointment with a ParentsNext provider. The customer can choose to opt out of the program after their appointment with a provider.</p>

<p>Prior to referring customers to a ParentsNext provider, Service Officers will need to code a CCE (Caring for a Child not eligible for Carer Payment) exemption on the customers record for 363 days or until the youngest child turns 6, whichever is earlier. This will enable customers who display as compulsory to voluntarily participate in the program.</p>

<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_and"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_and">Eligibility and selection</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Selection for ParentsNext is automatically determined by the system based on the information contained on the customer's record at the time of the eligibility assessment. A customer's reason for selection into ParentsNext is displayed on the ParentsNext Summary page within Customer First.</p>

<p>Although taking part in ParentsNext is no longer compulsory, the system will still select customers using the compulsory eligibility criteria. The customer's participation status will continue to display as compulsory for those selected for ParentsNext, even though participation in the program is now voluntary.</p>

<p><strong>Selection criteria</strong></p>

<p>All Parenting Payment customers with children under 6 years of age who reside in an employment service region are eligible to participate in ParentsNext.</p>

<p>The system will continue to select customers if they meet all of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They have been receiving Parenting Payment (PP) (Partnered or Single) for 6 months continuously</li>
		<li>
They are aged between 15 and under 54 years and 6 months of age, and</li>
		<li>
They have a youngest PP child aged 9 months to 5 years and 6 months</li>
		<li>
And <strong>one</strong> of the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Early School Leaver (ESL)</strong> - they are under 22 and haven't completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher</li>
			<li>
<strong>Two Years on Income Support (2IS)</strong> - they are 22 or over, haven't completed Year 12 or an equivalent qualification or higher and have been getting income support continuously for between 2 and 4 years</li>
			<li>
<strong>Four Years on Income Support (4IS)</strong> - they are 22 or over and have been getting income support continuously for more than 4 years</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the system calculates if the customer has been in receipt of payment continuously for two or four years based on the <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/1/1/n/130">Notional continuous period of receipt of income support payments</a>.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2023, Service Officers no longer need to confirm a customer's highest level of education as part of determining eligibility for ParentsNext. Customers who were selected as ESL or 2IS who advise they completed Year 12 are to be referred to a ParentsNext provider as these qualifications no longer impact eligibility from 1 October 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Ongoing eligibility for ParentsNext</strong></p>

<p>Once a customer has been selected for ParentsNext participant they may remain eligible for the program even where a change of circumstances means they no longer meet the initial selection criteria. For example, if after selection they commence declaring income or commence study, they will not necessarily be exited.</p>

<p>For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-01.html">ParentsNext exemptions and exits</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusion criteria</strong></p>

<p>A customer may meet the base selection eligibility criteria however they won't be selected for ParentsNext if any of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They live in a Community Development Program (CDP) region or Norfolk Island</li>
		<li>
They are in receipt of Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)</li>
		<li>
They have reported employment income or hours in the last six months</li>
		<li>
They are taking part in Disability Employment Services (DES)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Child 5 years and 6 months</strong></p>

<p>If a customer's youngest PP child is 5 years and 6 months or older <strong>at the time</strong> of the initial ParentsNext system eligibility assessment, they <strong>will not</strong> be selected for ParentsNext due to their impending mutual obligation requirements. However they can choose to volunteer.</p>

<p>Where a customer is selected for ParentsNext <strong>before</strong> their youngest child turns 5 years and 6 months of age but their ParentsNext appointment with the agency is <strong>after</strong> the child turns 5 years and 6 months the customer is eligible to be referred.</p>

<p>Prior to the recent changes to ParentsNext, if customers provided evidence of current study, completion of Year 12 or higher or they were on leave with a job to return to, they were exited from ParentsNext once this information was coded.</p>

<p>Under interim arrangements, this eligibility criteria no longer applies. A customer should still be referred to a ParentsNext provider if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
They were selected as ESL or 2IS and completed Year 12 or higher</li>
		<li>
are currently studying or</li>
		<li>
on leave with a job to return to</li>
		</ul>
<p>The provider will assess their circumstances and the customer can opt out of the program after a discussion with the provider.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances, if a customer does not consent to the appointment and they would have previously met the criteria to exit the program, code a CCE exemption. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-01.html">ParentsNext exemptions and exits</a>.</p>

<p>Customers who declare employment income after they have been selected for ParentsNext can still participate in the program. Services Officers must discuss the customer's <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120553-01.html">reporting requirements</a> prior to referral.</p>

<p><strong>Transient address</strong></p>

<p>Eligibility assessments for ParentsNext are based on the address that is recorded as the customer 's current home address at the time the assessment occurs, including the suburb where the address is recorded as 'no fixed address' due to transient accommodation.</p>

<p>Where a ParentsNext participant advises they have no fixed address due to transient accommodation they should be referred to a provider so they discuss their circumstances and work out how to best support the customer. It will be up to the provider and the customer to determine how best their provider appointments can be managed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not include where a customer advises they are homeless. In this scenario the Service Officer must determine if it is appropriate to grant an exemption. For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-01.html">ParentsNext exemptions and exits</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary address</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer has a temporary address recorded, and the address is recorded for&#58;</p>

13 weeks or more, the system will determine ParentsNext eligibility based on the temporary address and present ParentsNext providers within the online diary based on the temporary address</li>
		<li>
Less than 13 weeks, the system will determine ParentsNext eligibility based on the home address (not the temporary address) and will present providers within the online diary based on the home address</li>

<p>The Services Australia initial ParentsNext appointment must still be conducted if a customer is residing in a temporary location and a referral (where appropriate) to a ParentsNext provider for an initial appointment made. The customer can contact the provider to discuss whether the appointment can be conducted via phone. At the initial provider appointment the customer can discuss circumstances and options for receiving ParentsNext servicing whilst they reside in the temporary location.</p>

<p><strong>ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia</strong></p>

<p>Parenting Payment (PP) customers who are selected for ParentsNext are invited to undertake an appointment with the agency. Where the customer has a phone contact number recorded, the appointment will be undertaken by phone. If there is no contact phone number on the customer's record, the appointment is undertaken at the customer's local service centre.</p>

<p>For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160000-01.html">ParentsNext appointments and processing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rescheduling ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia</strong></p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers are able, and should be advised where appropriate, to reschedule any appointment type via their online account. Customers are able to reschedule via their online account if they are requesting a new appointment within 2 days of their original appointment. If the customer is unable to attend another appointment within 2 days, they will need to contact the agency to have their appointment rescheduled.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of times a Service Officer or customer can reschedule ParentsNext appointments. Appointments can only be rescheduled up to the scheduled date and time of the original appointment. After that point, the original appointment must be recorded as 'did not attend' and a new appointment booked.</p>

<p>The system will continue to book customers into an appointment until they are exempt or referred to a ParentsNext provider. Now that there are no longer payment suspensions, this cycle could continue indefinitely. Therefore if a customer does not attend 3 appointments, Service Officers are to code an exemption. See Table 6 Step in <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160000-01.html">ParentsNext appointments and processing</a>.</p>

<p>ParentsNext exemptions can be recorded by either the agency or a ParentsNext provider. This will exempt the customer from having compulsory participation requirements for the duration of the exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Interim Arrangements to facilitate voluntary participation</strong></p>

<p>As ParentsNext is now a voluntary service, all customers who have participation status of compulsory and who are referred to a ParentsNext provider must have a CCE exemption applied to their record until&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for 363 days or</li>
		<li>
their youngest child turns 6, whichever is the earlier</li>
		</ul>
<p>The use of the CCE exemption has been endorsed by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) as this will enable voluntary participation until the program is abolished.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances, the CCE exemption can be used on a discretionary basis if the customer does not consent to an appointment with a ParentsNext provider.</p>

<p>This exemption is also to be used for customers who do not attend 3 Services Australia ParentsNext appointments.</p>

<p>The granting of an exemption does not change a customer's ParentsNext eligibility status or their reason for selection. This means a customer will not exit from the program.</p>

<p><strong>Applying exemptions due to customer circumstances</strong></p>

<p>If a customer qualifies for an exemption based on their circumstances, i.e. family domestic violence, temporary medical incapacity,) Service Officers should apply the relevant exemption to match their circumstances.</p>

<p>Service Officers will have visibility of exemptions that a ParentsNext provider can record for a participant but they cannot make updates to the customer's record.</p>

<p>After applying these exemptions, Service Officers can at their discretion discuss the benefits of the program and book an appointment with a ParentsNext provider.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>All customers selected for ParentsNext are to be referred to a ParentsNext provider to give providers the opportunity to discuss the benefits of the program. Customers can opt in or out of ParentsNext after their discussion with a provider.</p>

<p>ParentsNext providers will&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
conduct an initial appointment with the customer to develop and create a Participation Plan</li>
		<li>
arrange activities that are chosen by the customer that fit in with their family life to help prepare for work and study</li>
		<li>
conduct appointments with the customer at least every 3 months</li>
		<li>
refer the customer to other service providers</li>
		<li>
assess customers' eligibility for an exemption from participation</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an interpreter is needed for the provider appointment this should be detailed in the notes field and the appointment must be booked no earlier than 7 days in the future.</p>

<p>If referral options are limited, continue to refer customers to an available provider if they raise concerns about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their provider's location</li>
		<li>
attending an appointment in person</li>
		</ul>
<p>Tell them their provider can discuss alternate servicing arrangements.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Voluntary_parti">Voluntary participants</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers who have not been selected for ParentsNext can choose to participate voluntarily in ParentsNext if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not live in a CDP region or Norfolk Island</li>
		<li>
are in receipt of Parenting Payment, and</li>
		<li>
have a child aged under 6 years</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a customer is eligible for voluntary participation, the <strong>Volunteer</strong> guided procedure will be enabled on the ParentsNext Summary page in Customer First. If the <strong>Volunteer </strong>guided procedure is not enabled, the customer is not eligible to voluntarily participate.</p>

<p>As a customer can choose to voluntarily participate before their youngest child is 9 months of age, there may be instances where the Customer Summary page displays the message '<strong>Never been a ParentsNext participant</strong>' and the ParentsNext Summary page will be blank. As the customer has not yet been automatically assessed for ParentsNext this display is correct.</p>

<p>Some customers may display as ineligible. If the Volunteer guided procedure is enabled the customer can still choose to volunteer in the program.</p>

<p>ParentsNext providers can direct register customers as a voluntary participant. Once commenced, voluntary participants can continue in ParentsNext for an unlimited period of time whilst they remain eligible.</p>

<p>A voluntary participant may be re-assessed against the selection criteria and their status may change to compulsory. The participant will be notified of their change in status and will be invited to attend a ParentsNext appointment with Services Australia to discuss their ongoing participation.</p>

<p>Where a voluntary participant advises they no longer wish to participate, they can only be exited by the agency/department that registered them as voluntary i.e. if registered by Services Australia, only Services Australia may apply the exit or if they were direct registered by the provider, only the provider can apply the exit.</p>
