<p>Payments to contracted TPOs are mostly made using Direct Deduction Facility. See the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01040070-05.html">Resources</a> page for a list of Income Management Deduction Service Reasons.</p>

<p>Other payment methods to contracted TPOs may be needed in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer asks for a payment of $1,000 or more</li>
		<li>
Payment asked for is for goods or services that fall outside the TPOs approved contracted Service Reasons, or</li>
		<li>
Customer asks for a one off payment (OOP) and has a regular direct credit allocation delivering to the TPO on the same day</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Payments of $1,000 or more or a requested OOP is deliverable same day as the regular allocation</strong></p>

<p>Payments using Direct Deduction Facility to contracted TPOs for $1,000 or more or an OOP attempting to deliver on the same day as a regular allocation, may corrupt a TPO's daily report, resulting in TPOs being unable to determine funds available for customers. This means customers may not be able to immediately access their Income Management funds.</p>

<p><strong>Requests for payments using a new uncontracted service reason</strong></p>

<p>When requesting payments to TPOs, select the correct service reason for each payment. See the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01040070-05.html">Resources</a> page for a list of Customer Income Management Deduction Service Reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in all instances, where an appropriate expense category does not exist, Service Officers <strong>must</strong> select '<strong>New expense category required</strong>' as the expense category.</p>

<p>Send all requests for a new uncontracted service reason (identified by the '<strong>U</strong>' at the start of the expense category) to Income Management Payments and Contract Team (IMPACT) for processing by completing the <strong>Expense Request workflow</strong>.

		</ul>
<p>Select the correct TPO from the <strong>Expense Management TPO</strong> list. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the TPO may be listed a number of times. Make sure the TPO with the correct service reason is selected. Un-contracted TPOs can be identified with a 'U' in front of the expense code.</p>

<p>Check the TPO details in Office Locator to see if the TPO has refused to accept urgent one-off payments. <strong>If the TPO does not accept these payments, explore other options to help the customer in the short term such as social work referral.</strong></p>

<p>To assess whether customers are in urgent need of a one-off payment, and to limit the chances of customers not turning up to a TPO, check the following details when a customer asks for an urgent one-off payment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check earlier allocations (especially urgent payments already asked for that day by the customer or their partner)</li>
		<li>
Has the customer checked whether there are already enough unspent funds available at a store?</li>
		<li>
Check ongoing allocations - is the customer in need of an urgent payment because the regular payment is insufficient? Increase the regular Income Management expense if necessary</li>
		<li>
Is there a history of the customer seeking urgent requests? Increase the regular Income Management expense if necessary</li>
		<li>
Does the customer need access to the goods immediately?</li>
		<li>
Is the customer in hardship due to unforeseen circumstances?</li>
		<li>
Does the customer have access to discretionary funds?</li>
		<li>
Will making the payment using standard processes cause genuine hardship? The urgent request process excludes requests for clothing and household goods and typically transport unless the customer's circumstances are exceptional and unforeseen (for example, the need to travel to visit sick relatives)</li>
		</ul>
<p>In all urgent cases for one-off expense to an unregistered TPO, the '<strong>Urgent</strong>' radio button must be ticked on the <strong>Expense Request screen</strong>. Service Officers must record the reason for urgency in the <strong>Expense Notes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in extremely urgent situations, the Service Officer should call IMPACT, for example, stranded due to bad weather or visiting another community due to illness/funeral.</p>

<p><strong>Request is not urgent</strong></p>

<p>If the request is not urgent, check and arrange alternative means of help, if available.</p>

<p>Tell the customer one-off payments made using IMPACT will typically take up to 48 hours.</p>

<p>Documentation may be needed, <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01040070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Expense_Request_Step04">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

No documentation or verification is <strong>needed</strong> if making a one-off payment to a reputable TPO (contracted or un-contracted) that does not sell prohibited items. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who have asked for payment for a travel expense should be transferred to IMPACT as prompted when Expense Category UM6 (Travel and Transport) is selected within the workflow</li>
		<li>
For <strong>purchases from private sellers</strong> - while it is not possible to describe all situations, the onus is on the customer to satisfy the delegate the arrangement is legitimate. Obtain more details about the private sale from the customer to conduct additional checks before proceeding</li>
		<li>
For payments to a customer's credit card or for the payment of private rent documentation is needed before TPO payment is made</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is being placed on Auto Income Management, existing Centrepay deductions can be changed to an Income Management expense. <strong>However</strong>, only Centrepay deductions that meet a priority need should be changed, such as housing, electricity, telephone.</p>

<p><strong>TPO will not accept payment</strong></p>

<p>Services Australia needs to explore other alternatives for the customer.</p>

<p>Investigate alternative options, such as nearby merchants who will accept an Income Management payment and who provide equivalent goods or services.</p>

<p>If alternatives are found, update the Notes in the <strong>Expense Request</strong> and cancel the request. If appropriate, make alternate payment as agreed with the customer.</p>

<p><strong>No alternatives available</strong></p>

<p>If there are no other alternatives, and the customer needs funds for food, fuel or urgent travel expenses, escalate to a Services Australia Account Manager.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The Account Manager will engage with the TPO and attempt to negotiate a suitable arrangement for the allocation of Income Management funds to meet the customer's needs</li>
		<li>
If, after this engagement, it is still not possible to meet essential needs such as food, fuel or urgent travel expenses, consider making a <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01050110-01.html">restricted direct payment</a> to the customer to meet their need</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an expense request is urgent and the customer will be placed in hardship because IMPACT's cannot process the expense (because of insufficient information or the TPO's refusal to accept payment), follow business as usual processes for urgent payment requests, with the outcome situation dependent.</p>
