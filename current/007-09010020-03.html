<p>This screen will show whether the employer is responsible for delivering PPL.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Employers are responsible for providing PPL to their eligible employees. However, where the employee is receiving an income support payment (ISP), PPL paid for children born or entering care will be delivered by Services Australia</li>
		<li>
If the customer is an eligible employee, they will not have the option to choose who will deliver the payment. PPL will be delivered by Services Australia, if&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
it cannot be delivered by the employer, or </li>
			<li>
the employer is not required to have an Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Employers who are not <strong>required</strong> to provide PPL to an employee can voluntarily <strong>elect</strong> to provide for all full-time, part-time, permanent and casual employees, regardless of how long they have been working for the employer. Services Australia <strong>must</strong> obtain consent from the employee before making an employer determination. Employers&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
can pre-register their details online using Provider Digital Access (PRODA) to access the Business Hub, and </li>
			<li>
indicate an employee or specific group of employees they wish to provide PPL for </li>
			<li>
must register with Services Australia and opt in <strong>before</strong> the employee claim being submitted</li>
			<li>
Note&#58; where it is not mandatory for an employer to deliver PPL to a specific employee (i.e. Employee has been employed less than 12 months) and the employer has opted into delivering PPL on behalf of the business and the employer&#58;<br>- has accepted within 14 days, payments will be delivered by the employer, or<br>- has not accepted within 14 days the MFU will not generate on day 15 and an automatic transfer of paymaster role to Services Australia will occur</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The employer may withdraw an election by providing written notice to Services Australia. Services Australia may cancel an employer's election to pay PPL if satisfied it may not be appropriate for the employer to do so</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some circumstances, employers are not required to have an ABN, for example, an overseas employer, or people who employ household workers such as cleaners, nannies or gardeners. In these cases, Services Australia will deliver PPL to the employee as the employer is not recognised as a PPL employer. See <a href="../families/007-17100603-01.html">Processing standalone and combined claims for family assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The payment delivery role must <strong>only</strong> be updated by the Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team (PPLEPT).</p>

<p>The <strong>P1CP</strong> screen will show whether the employer is responsible for delivering PPL. To view who is delivering PPL&#58;</p>

<p>Select <strong>Claim Contact &gt; Paid Parental Leave Claim summary </strong>in the employee's record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
go to the Paid Parental Leave Claim summary (<strong>P1CS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
key '<strong>P</strong>' beside the relevant claim</li>
		<li>
if <strong>FAO</strong> or <strong>Pending</strong> displays as the employer and the employee has indicated they would like their employer to deliver their PPL, consider the following&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the employer may not have registered as an organisation to deliver PPL</li>
			<li>
the employer may have registered but not accepted, within 14 days, to deliver PPL to an employee</li>
			<li>
the employer may have registered and accepted an employee, to deliver PPL, <strong>after</strong> the date of the post-birth/entry into care claim</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If an employer determination is made, the employer will be responsible for the delivery of the employer paid period of up to&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
18 weeks, for children that are born or adopted <strong>before 1 July 2020</strong></li>
		<li>
12 weeks plus any connected Flexible PPL days, for children that are born or adopted <strong>on or</strong> <strong>after 1 July 2020 </strong>and<strong> before 1 July 2023</strong></li>
		<li>
The first payment period of a continuous period of at least 8 weeks consisting of 5 PPL days per week for every weekday (i.e.. Monday to Friday only and does not include weekends), for children that are born or adopted <strong>on or after 1 July 2023</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Australian Public Service (APS) employees, if the employee has worked for the APS  for more than 12 months, an employer determination would be made by their current APS employer, regardless of the duration with that particular agency or department.</p>

<p>For complex cases that require employer contact in regards to meeting their obligations in providing PPL, handoff to PPLEPT. See local Processing Services details for&#58; Paid Parental Leave (PPL) - Employer Processing.</p>

the payment amount, </li>

the payment period, and </li>

<p>Payments are provided direct to the employee by Services Australia or to the employer. If Services Australia provides payments to the employer, the employer will provide the appropriate amount to the customer in their next available regular payday.</p>

<p>Where PPL is delivered by the employer the <strong>Delivery Date&#58;</strong> field indicates when the employer received the funding, <strong>not</strong> when payment was received by the employee.</p>

<p>Where the employer selects irregular or other as their pay cycle frequency, the employer will not be able to input pay cycle dates and funding will only be delivered in 6 weekly instalments. This will display on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen of the employee as 6WE (6 weekly).</p>

<p>Employer payments will have a gross amount equivalent to the total PPL funding amount and a net amount of $0.00.</p>

<p><strong>Period Rate Explanation (REX) screen</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>REX</strong> screen will advise of the employee's basic rate and any withholdings. This screen is accessed by coding '<strong>REXPPL</strong>' in the <strong>Nxt&#58;</strong> field.</p>

Flexible PPL days that are not connected to the PPL period, and</li>
			<li>
any connected Flexible PPL days that are scheduled on dates on or after the child’s first birthday, or anniversary of adoption</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For children born or adopted <strong>on or after 1 July 2023</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
where a customer has claimed a day on the weekend (i.e. Saturday or Sunday)</li>
			<li>
any subsequent PPL days, including periods of 8 weeks or longer that are separated from the first period</li>
			<li>
where the customer is already current and a day or more is added before the continuous block and the new day(s) are not a continuous block of at least 8 weeks of consecutive weekdays</li>
			<li>
any PPL days nominated on or after the child’s first birthday, or anniversary of adoption</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the PPL claim is a status of CAN-EOP resulting in arrears to the employee, tax may not be deducted. See <a href="../families/007-05040020-01.html">Customer notifies a change of circumstances for PPL</a>.</p>

<p>For children born or adopted before 1 July 2023, Services Australia may deduct money from a secondary claimant's PPL fortnightly instalments to repay a debt owed by a primary claimant for the same child, if the secondary claimant consents in writing. </p>

<p>The standard withholding amount for PPL is 100%. A PPL withholding arrangement is broken if the employee does not receive any PPL over a 28 day period. If the employee receives PPL more than 28 days after their last PPL payment, the withholding will not restart. The employee must make a new arrangement. For further information, see <a href="../debts/107-04070010-01.html">Parental Leave Pay (PPL) debt raising, debt offsetting and recovery</a>.</p>

<p>When Services Australia is required to take over payment of PPL from an employer and there was a current salary sacrifice arrangement in place, Services Australia will not be able to accommodate the salary sacrificing arrangements.</p>

<p>When an employee lodges a claim for PPL and an employer determination is made (the employer is responsible for providing PPL to the employee), a <strong>notification</strong> is sent to the employer which includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the employee's name</li>
		<li>
that the employee is eligible for PPL</li>
		<li>
the period for which the employer is to provide PPL to the employee</li>
		<li>
a request to verify that the employer's PPL details have not changed</li>
		<li>
the employer's obligations under the PPL scheme</li>
		<li>
the review and appeal rights of the employer if the employer disagrees with the decision that they are to provide PPL to the employee</li>
		</ul>
<p>The notification is sent electronically or by mail. Letters are also issued to advise the employer of any changes to the determination.</p>

<p>A confirmation letter is sent to the employer when they accept employer determination.</p>

<p><strong>JobKeeper Payment</strong></p>

<p>JobKeeper Payments were payable from 30 March 2020 to 28 March 2021 and were paid to employees by the employer.</p>

<p>The introduction of the ‘Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits)’ meant employees could not receive JobKeeper Payment for the same period they receive PPL.</p>

<p>Where employers advise that the employee will have received PPL and JobKeeper for the same period, advise them the start and end dates for the PPL period. Direct the employer to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for any further enquiries about JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer of payments to employers</strong></p>

<p>Services Australia works with employers to ensure the PPL amount is provided in advance to them before they are required to provide PPL to an employee. There is no obligation for an employer to provide PPL until they have received the required funds.</p>

<p>Payments are electronically transferred to the employer's nominated bank account. A payment notice (either electronic or in another written form) is provided with each payment.</p>

<p>Services Australia is able to make up to 9 fortnightly instalments or 3 six-weekly instalments of PPL funding to an employer. The employer elects a preferred delivery frequency.</p>

<p>Payments are transferred prior to the employer's pay cycle. This will be before the pay cut-off date for any changes to the employee's pay for that pay period.</p>

<p>Employers with <strong>multiple employees</strong> receiving PPL receive 1 payment from Services Australia per environment per pay cycle for all the employees in that pay cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Employer providing payments before employer determination and/or start date of employer paid period</strong></p>

<p>Paid Parental Leave legislation does not provide authority for an employer to provide PPL before either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the start of the person's employer paid period, or </li>
		<li>
an employer determination is in force</li>
		</ul>
<p>If an employer chooses to provide what they consider to be PPL to an employee prior to an employer determination and/or the start date of the employer paid period, these payments are not PPL.</p>

<p>Therefore these payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not affect an employer's obligation to provide PPL in accordance with the Paid Parental Leave Act once they have been funded to do so, and</li>
		<li>
should not be offset against PPL funds provided to enable the employer to provide PPL</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>PPL considered as income for employer</strong></p>

<p>PPL is income for the employer and the payment provided to the employee is a deduction. Interest earned on PPL is also income.</p>

<p><strong>Deductions from payments</strong></p>

<p>Centrepay and rent deductions are not available when the employer provides PPL to the employee. Any voluntary deductions from the PPL for the employee's benefit (for example, superannuation) can be negotiated by the employee with their employer.</p>

<p>For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023 the employer determination will be revoked if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
removes a day from the continuous weeks to create a gap (including where they are ineligible on a day); or</li>
		<li>
adds a weekend day during the continuous period</li>

<p>An employer determination that is in place should continue until the date of the gap, or weekend day, or the end of the continuous PPL days (even if the customer reduces the period to less than 8 weeks).</p>
