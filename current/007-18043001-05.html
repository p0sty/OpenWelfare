<p>A special circumstance exemption <strong>may</strong> be granted if there are unusual and unexpected circumstances that mean that it is not reasonable for a customer to meet HSFS requirements. Special circumstances exemptions must be applied for before the child's fifth birthday.</p>

<p>These generally relate to the customer's circumstances rather than the child's. Requests must be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

Customer having lost, then regained care of a child</li>

<p>Pam lives on a remote cattle station in the Northern Territory. Pam receives Parenting Payment Single and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for their child Leo who turned 4 on 3 July 2018.</p>

<p>The nearest medical facility is several hundred kilometres away. The Royal Flying Doctor Service provides remote medical services online and by radio and provides a visiting service at least twice a year, as well as in emergency situations.</p>

<p>After receiving a letter advising that HSFS requirements will affect Pam's rate of FTB Part A from 3 July 2019.</p>

<p>Pam is concerned they will not be able to meet HSFS requirements as they will have to wait until the next available opportunity to organise a physical check for Leo, which could be several months away.</p>

<p>Further, if circumstances prevent Pam from attending the next available appointment, Pam may have to wait again and Pam does not want to risk not being able to attend an appointment before Leo's fifth birthday.</p>

<p><strong>Based on these facts, this would not constitute special circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>Using the 'reasonableness test' as detailed in <a href="../families/007-18043001-05.html#bp05_tbl_Special_circums_3">Item 3</a>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Were there multiple situations or events the customer experienced which prevented Pam from arranging Leo to undertake the health check?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - only the one situation</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Was the situation unusual and/or extraordinary?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - this would be an expected circumstance living in a remote area</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the situations or events prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check before the child's fifth birthday?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - even if Pam cannot get their child's health checked in the next couple of months, Pam still has until the day before the child's fifth birthday to get the health check completed and notify</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the general public consider it reasonable the situation/s or event/s were sufficient to prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - the Service Officer may determine the health check could be completed for the child. The check would just need to be delayed</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Has the customer explored all options in an attempt to satisfy the health check requirement?</li>
		<li>
Has the child undertaken a suitable health check anytime since their third birthday?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - the customer has not advised if any attempt has been made to find other ways for their child to undertake the health check</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If, in addition, Pam lives in a remote location and Pam also experienced other circumstances, such as their own recurring health issues that affected their ability to arrange a health check for Leo, these other factors could together constitute special circumstances. These other factors could include that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Pam suffered from a major depressive disorder which meant that part way through the year Leo turned 4 Pam had to relinquish care to Leo's grandparents, who lived in a town several hundred kilometres away</li>
		<li>
In the meantime, Pam has recovered sufficiently from their illness and resumes care of Leo at this time</li>
		<li>
As a result of a recent accident, Pam is temporarily without a vehicle and cannot take Leo to the nearest town</li>
		<li>
Pam makes arrangements for Leo to see a doctor from the Royal Flying Doctor Service, but as it is not an emergency, the visit will not occur for another month</li>
		</ul>
<p>Again applying the 'reasonableness test'&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Were there multiple situations or events the customer experienced which prevented them from undertaking the health check for the child?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Yes - the customer experienced multiple situations at the one time.</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Were the situations unusual and/or extraordinary?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Yes - some of them were. The customer did not expect to become ill or to lose care of their child.</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the situations or events prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check before the child's fifth birthday?</li>
		<li>
Would the situations or events prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check after their fifth birthday but before their sixth birthday?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Maybe - the situations and/or events may make it difficult for the customer to arrange the health check before the end of the applicable timeframe</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the general public consider it reasonable the situation/s or event/s were sufficient to prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Maybe - based on the time the child was in the customer's care the general public may determine that it would be difficult for the customer to arrange for their child to undertake the health check</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Has the customer explored all options in an attempt to satisfy the health check requirement?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Unknown. Need to discuss this with the customer to determine</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The answers detailed above would not necessarily mean that special circumstances exist for Pam. The Service Officer would be required to use all the information available to make a decision about whether a special circumstance applies for an exemption or extension.</p>

<p>Mark received Parenting Payment Single and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for Kian who turned 4 on 29 August 2018.</p>

<p>In December 2018, Mark suffered from a major accident and is hospitalised and Kian moves interstates into the care of family.</p>

<p>Kian returns to Mark's care on 16 August 2019. Mark contacts to advise that an appointment for Kian to receive a health check has been made with Mark's GP, however the first available appointment is on 5 September - after Kian's fifth birthday. Kian's previous carers did not take Kian for a health check.</p>

<p><strong>Based on these facts, this may constitute special circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>Tam received Parenting Payment Single and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for Shenal who turned 4 on 1 February 2019. Tam received notification about HSFS requirements in January, May, and August 2019.</p>

<p>Eight weeks prior to Shenal's fifth birthday, Tam receives a reminder letter advising the rate of FTB Part A for Shenal will be reduced from 1 February 2020 if HSFS requirements are not met.</p>

<p>On 1 February 2020 an FTB Part A rate reduction due to HSFS requirements commences.</p>

<p>Tam contacts as a result of the change in rate.</p>

<p>Tam advises they gave birth to twins on 6 January 2020 and was too busy to take Shenal for a health check. An appointment is scheduled for next week.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is Tam entitled to an exemption due to special circumstances?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No. Exemptions must be applied for prior to the child's fifth birthday. Plus, the health check could still be completed for Shenal.</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Is Tam entitled to an extension due to special circumstances?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Using the 'reasonable test' as detailed in</strong> <a href="../families/007-18043001-05.html#bp05_tbl_Special_circums_3">Item 3</a>&#58;</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Were there multiple situations or events the customer experiences which prevented Tam from arranging for Shenal to undertake the health check?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - only the one situation</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Was the situation unusual and/or extraordinary?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - this would be an expected circumstance</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Would the situations or events prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check before the child's fifth birthday?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No. Tam could have taken Shenal for a health check from their third birthday.</strong> The Service Officer would need to be satisfied there were other circumstances that prevented Tam from meeting the requirements before Shenal's fifth birthday.</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The Service Officer should also ask Tam whether Shenal attended an acceptable health check before the birth of the twins. If the Service Officer is satisfied that this occurred before 1 February 2020, and Tam is able to provide a date, the HSFS status can be updated</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Would the general public consider it is reasonable the situation/s or event/s were sufficient to prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No - the Service Officer may determine the health check could still be completed for Shenal. The check would just need to be delayed</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Has the customer explored all options in an attempt to satisfy the health check requirement?</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>No- the customer has not advised if any attempt has been made to find other ways for their child to undertake the health check.</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If, in addition, Tam experienced other circumstances, such as Tam's own recurring health issues that affected their ability to arrange a health check for Shenal, these other factors could together constitute special circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> A health check, for the Healthy Start for School initiative, is an assessment of the customer's child's physical health and general well-being and will include height, weight, hearing and vision. This basic health check promotes early detection of life risk factors, delayed development and illness which may make it more difficult for children to learn when they start school.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The aim of this health check is to improve the health and well-being of Australian children. Health checks are available for all children and may detect problems affecting hearing and vision that make it more difficult to learn. To ensure their children are healthy, fit and ready to learn when they start school, some families are being asked to have their child undertake a health check and notify the agency.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The health check can be done by a recognised health professional such as a doctor, practise nurse or Aboriginal health worker and the customer should discuss any cost or potential Medicare refund with them.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The requirement is for the customer's child to have a health check completed. The health check will be recorded as being completed, not the outcome of the health check. If the health professional identifies any issue that requires action or follow-up, they will discuss this with the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I have not been able to arrange a health check appointment before my child's fifth birthday as there are limited services and appointments in my area.

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> These circumstances alone do not qualify for an exemption or extension unless special circumstances apply. If the customer is unable to organise an appointment before their child's fifth birthday they will not meet HSFS requirements. An FTB part A reduction due to HSFS will be applied from the child's fifth birthday and continue for the number of day/s the customer or their partner were receiving an income support payment in the financial year their child turned 4 years of age.</p>

<p>If special circumstances apply, the customer could be granted an extension of time to complete the health check before child's sixth birthday</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I got my Family Tax Benefit (FTB) assessment letter which says I have an FTB Part A rate reduction due to my child not having a health check. My child received a health check last year. What can I do?</strong> <a title="Read more 13" class="showhead bp05_tbl_FAQs_from_custo_6" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;"><span class="showhead bp05_tbl_FAQs_from_custo_6" onclick="erefshow(this)" href="javascript:;">+</span> Read more ...</a></p>
<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> If a health check was completed between the child's third and before the fifth birthday the HSFS requirements can be updated provided the customer is able to confirm the date the health check was completed. If you are not satisfied the health check was completed before the child's fifth birthday, request suitable evidence of the date the health check was completed.</p>

<p>The FTB Part A reduction will remain in place until the evidence is received and the HSFS requirements are updated. Once this occurs, any FTB Part A reduction due to HSFS that was applied will be reassessed and arrears paid if appropriate.</p>

<p>If the health check was completed after the child's fifth birthday, the child does not meet HSFS requirements and the <strong>rate reduction will remain in place</strong>.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Yes, as the customer and/or their partner received an ISP for at least one day in the financial year in which their child turned 4 the health check requirements apply. If the requirements are not met before the child's fifth birthday, the HSFS reduction period will be the equivalent of the number of days the customer and/or their partner received an income support payment in the financial year in which their child turned 4.</p>
