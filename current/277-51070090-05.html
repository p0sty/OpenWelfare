<p><strong>Backdating a child support exemption</strong></p>

<p>Wendy had a child in September 2015 and failed to take maintenance action for the child. Over the years, Wendy was in contact with Services Australia many times advising of the wish to apply for a parentage unknown exemption. Wendy was not aware who the father was. On many occasions, Wendy even attended social worker appointments to request an exemption.</p>

<p>On each occasion, Wendy was advised of the need to provide the child's birth certificate to show that the father was not named. Wendy's FTB increased several times as a result of these discussions. This was due to Wendy advising the birth certificate would be supplied within the specified timeframe.</p>

<p>In November 2020, Wendy again contacted and requested an exemption. Wendy was again advised of the need to provide the child's birth certificate. In December 2020, Wendy provided the child's birth certificate showing the father was not named.</p>

<p>The social worker assessing Wendy's case requested that the exemption be backdated to the child's date of birth in 2015. The reason is the identity of the father had been unknown from then.</p>

<p>Special circumstances must be established before the exemption can be backdated to the child's date of birth in 2015 because&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the exemption was requested in the 2020-21 financial year and </li>
		<li>
the social worker is recommending the exemption be backdated to September 2015, which is before the start of the previous financial year (1 July 2019) </li>
		</ul>
<p>The case is referred to the Senior Practitioner attached to the Smart Centre team to which the <strong>ACTDOC</strong> is mapped. They need to assess a special circumstances period before 1 July 2019.</p>

<p>The Senior Practitioner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
considers all information on the customer's record</li>
		<li>
liaises with the referring social worker, and </li>
		<li>
determines that special circumstances do not apply</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is clear Wendy was advised verbally and in writing over the previous 5 years what action was required. As a result, the exemption is backdated to 1 July of the previous financial year.</p>

<p>The date of effect for coding the Parentage Unknown exemption on the Maintenance Action (<strong>MNMA</strong>) screen would be 1 July 2019, the beginning of the previous financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic and family violence exemptions and shared care (only 1 child support case)</strong></p>

<p>In situations where customers share the care of a child or if each parent has 1 or more children in care, only 1 child support case is required rather than 2.</p>

<p>If both parties have had their circumstances taken into account for a child support case, both parties are considered to have met the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for the relevant child/ren.</p>

<p>As no data is electronically received from Child Support to indicate that the child/ren in the payer’s care are meeting the MAT, manually apply the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51070030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Maintenance_Act_4">'MWP' workaround</a> to the relevant children in the child support payer's FTB record. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> PPW may be present on the MNMR screens for the child/ren in the payer’s record where PPW conditions have been met. If PPW is present, MWP does not need to be coded.</p>

<p>Where the payee has an exemption (such as 'VIO' exemption due to violence) and then becomes the payer, the exemption, that is VIO, no longer applies. The <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-51070030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Maintenance_Act_4">'MWP' workaround</a> needs to be manually applied from the date the payee became the payer. The customer that was the payer and is now the potential payee needs to apply for child support (PDE needs to be coded from the date the customer is advised to take maintenance action).</p>

<p><strong>Shared care example (alleged perpetrator of violence starts child support case as payee)</strong></p>

<p>Ebony and William share the care of Evie, and have 50/50 care. Ebony was the payee in a child support case which was ended when Ebony was granted a MAT exemption due to violence (VIO). Recently however Ebony's income has increased substantially, meaning if there were a child support case in place, Ebony could go from being the payee to the payer. There is no violence exemption available where the (potential) payer is the victim. In these circumstances, the (potential) payee retains their obligation to take appropriate maintenance action.</p>

<p>William decides to apply for a child support assessment against Ebony. In this case, Ebony's violence exemption no longer applies because Ebony is no longer the 'payee'. Ebony would continue to pass the MAT in light of the fact that there can only be 1 child support case.</p>

<p><strong>Divided care example</strong></p>

<p>Samantha and Daniel have 3 children and are separated. Samantha has care of 2 of the children (William and Phoebe) and Daniel has care of 1 child (Joseph).</p>

<p>Samantha has been granted a violence exemption in respect of William and Phoebe and therefore is not required to seek child support from Daniel. The child support case has been ended as a result.</p>

<p>Daniel decides to apply for a child support assessment against Samantha in respect of Joseph.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where an exemption has been granted for the payee (Samantha) the requirement for the payer (Daniel) to take reasonable action to obtain maintenance in respect of the children of the relationship in their care generally does not apply. They are regarded as having taken reasonable action by virtue of the fact that the child/ren in their care would be included in the overall assessment. The potential payer (Daniel) should be advised that they will end up being the payer in the case due to the other children being included in the assessment.</p>

<p>If Daniel chooses to proceed with the child support application, the assessment will take all 3 children into account. Due to Samantha having a lower income, Samantha becomes the payee. This will have the effect of overriding Samantha's violence exemption with details of the child support case, even though Samantha did not apply for child support. This means that Samantha's FTB will potentially be reduced due to maintenance income, even though Samantha did not initiate the child support case.</p>

<p>Samantha contacts to query the reduction in FTB rate and the recommencement of the child support case as Samantha does not wish to have a case against the father of the children due to domestic violence issues. Check whether the social worker made a decision that the violence exemption should be ongoing/indefinite or is subject to a future review date.</p>

<p>If it is found that the exemption still applies and the child support case is to be ended, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-03.html#bp03_tbl_Granting_denyi_Step03">Step 3 in the Granting, denying and reviewing exemptions from child support</a> table. Otherwise a new exemption may need to be assessed as per current procedures.</p>

<p>If a customer's exemption is reinstated and the child support case is ended, this may impact on the other parent if they are receiving or entitled to receive FTB Part A at more than the base rate. In this scenario, when the payer (Daniel) contacts Services Australia, they should be considered to have met the MAT in respect of the child Joseph, and the MWP payer workaround should be applied/coded. This may prevent the payer from restarting the child support case.</p>

<p><strong>Example - family and domestic violence</strong></p>

<p>Kathryn contacts Services Australia because the FTB Part A payment has reduced to the minimum rate.</p>

<p>In the discussion with Kathryn, the Service Officer identifies that Kathryn has serious concerns about personal safety if child support is claimed from the children's other parent.</p>

<p>Exemption options with Kathryn are discussed, and Kathryn confirms that this would be the best option for this situation.</p>

<p>The Service Officer refers Kathryn to a social worker for an exemption assessment, and codes the MXR MAT code pending the decision.</p>

<p>The social worker completes an interview with Kathryn and assesses that Kathryn is in genuine fear due to family and domestic violence concerns. An exemption is granted (MAT code VIO).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Kathryn does not have a child support assessment in place, ending an assessment is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Example - serious imposition</strong></p>

<p>Carolyn contacts Services Australia because FTB Part A payment has reduced significantly.</p>

<p>Carolyn explains that if the other parent is asked for child support, there is a concern that the other parent may end their life. Carolyn advises that the other parent is currently hospitalised due to serious mental health problems.</p>

<p>Carolyn advises that although they are separated, Carolyn still helps the ex-partner a lot at the moment. The ex-partner has elderly parents and just lost a job.</p>

<p>The Service Officer explains that Carolyn may be able to seek an exemption from having a child support assessment. Carolyn agrees that this would be a good option and is referred to a social worker.</p>

<p>The social worker completes an assessment with Carolyn and grants an exemption due to 'imposition' (MAT code IMP).</p>

<p><strong>Reapplying a Maintenance Exemption </strong></p>

<p><strong>Backdating the Maintenance Exemption that is being reapplied</strong></p>

<p>Maddie had a full maintenance exemption of VIO (Violence) for child Lincoln before Lincoln left Maddie’s care on 4 July 2018. </p>

<p>Maddie lodged an FTB new claim with Services Australia on 30 November 2018 advising that Lincoln returned to Maddie’s care on 15 August 2018 and there have been no significant changes to the family circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Significant change in circumstances</strong> may include but are not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Additional child/ren enters the customer’s care</li>
		<li>
Change in marital status</li>
		<li>
Overseas absences</li>
		</ul>
<p>A full exemption for VIO can be reapplied without a Social Worker assessment because Lincoln has returned to Maddie’s care within 13 weeks <strong>and</strong> there have been no significant changes in their family circumstances.</p>

<p>The date of effect for coding VIO on the Maintenance Action (MNMA) screen for Lincoln is 15 August 2018. The backdating of the exemption may cause FTB arrears to be paid because the 13 week Deciding Maintenance Action (DMA) period has finished and the MNMA screen may now display No Maintenance Action (NMA).</p>

<p><strong>Level of care increases to more than 35% within 13 weeks</strong></p>

<p>Corey has had 60% care of the children Erin and Liam for the last 2 years with a full maintenance exemption of IMP (Imposition). The level of care for Erin and Liam decreased to 30% on 14 August 2018. On 30 October 2018, Services Australia was advised the level of care for Corey increased to 70% on 16 October 2018.</p>

<p>A full exemption for IMP can be reapplied without a Social Worker assessment because&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the level of care for Erin and Liam has increased over 35% within 13 weeks <strong>and</strong> </li>
		<li>
there have been no significant changes in Corey’s family circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>The date of effect for coding the imposition exemption on the Maintenance Action (MNMA) screens for Erin and Liam is 16 October 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Child returns to care more than 13 weeks after leaving care</strong></p>

<p>Tom had a full maintenance exemption of VIO (Violence) for child Wilson before Wilson left Tom’s care on 5 January 2018. </p>

<p>Tom lodged an FTB new claim with Services Australia on 29 December 2018 advising&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Wilson returned to Tom’s care on 20 December 2018 <strong>and</strong> </li>
		<li>
there have been no significant changes to the family circumstances</li>

<p><strong>Retrospective increase in child support assessment for a private collect period – customer unable to collect the arrears</strong></p>

<p>Wendy has had a private collect child support case against ex-partner John since 1 July 2014. John’s child support assessment has always been $1500pa, which Wendy has always collected.</p>

<p>In 2018, John lodges tax returns back to 1 July 2014, and Child Support reassess the child support assessments. John’s child support liability is retrospectively increased to $19,500pa for each year from 2014/2015-2017/2018. This information is sent to Centrelink via the data exchange, and results in reconciliation debts for Wendy, as it is deemed $19,500pa was collected by Wendy.</p>

<p>Wendy contacts Centrelink and advises that John has refused to pay the child support arrears privately and Wendy has changed to Child Support collect. The reason is John has refused to pay the new assessment ongoing. Wendy is advised that it may be best to seek legal advice. </p>

<p>Wendy contacts a legal practitioner, and they advise that it would not be cost effective for them to assist. John has declared bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Wendy obtains a letter from the legal practitioner which confirms they cannot assist. Wendy presents this letter to Centrelink. Wendy is referred to a Social Worker to apply for a partial exemption for the years 2014/2015-2017/2018. Reason is ‘other exceptional circumstances’. For Wendy, the exceptional circumstance is gaining legal assistance was attempted, however it is not cost effective for the legal practitioner to pursue the arrears.</p>

<p>The Social Worker grants a partial exemption for Wendy for the applicable years. This allows the MIT to be updated for those years to reflect the $1500pa that Wendy actually collected.</p>
