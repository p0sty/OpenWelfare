<p>To be eligible for PPL, a customer must be the primary carer of a PPL child.</p>

<p>The primary claimant can receive up to 18 weeks of PPL. This is 90 payable days.</p>

<p>Primary claimants can claim the full amount for themselves or choose to&#58;</p>

transfer some or all of their PPL period to another person</li>
		<li>
give permission for another person to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days</li>

		<li>
be an eligible <a href="../families/007-09020020-01.html">secondary/tertiary claimant</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Most often, the primary claimant will be the birth mother or the initial primary carer of an adopted child. Another person may be eligible as a primary claimant if exceptional circumstances eligibility criteria are met e.g. commissioning parent in surrogacy arrangement.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> primary claimants in exceptional circumstances can claim the full amount of PPL if they are eligible. Secondary claimants who become the primary carer in exceptional circumstances are only eligible for up to the remainder of the PPL that has not been claimed by the primary claimant. For secondary claimants, the amount of PPL will depend on how much PPL was paid to the primary claimant.</p>

<p>Customer may have entered into an Australian altruistic surrogacy arrangement or an overseas surrogacy arrangement, which could be commercial or altruistic. Depending where the arrangement was made will determine what evidence is required. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Australian Surrogacy arrangement</strong></p>

<p>A surrogacy arrangement entered into in Australia must meet the relevant state or territory law. In all Australian states and territories, the surrogacy agreement must be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
altruistic (the surrogate does not receive any financial payment or other reward for acting as a surrogate)</li>
		<li>
signed and finalised by all parties, generally through solicitors prior to the surrogate becoming pregnant</li>
		</ul>
<p>Commissioning parents have to apply for a parentage order before the child is 6 months of age (12 months for South Australia). Most commissioning parents won’t have the parentage order completed before claiming PPL. The surrogacy agreement and confirmation that the surrogate has relinquished care of the child is acceptable evidence. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Overseas surrogacy arrangement</strong></p>

<p>Overseas surrogacy arrangements are generally commercial. This means the surrogate is financially compensated for carrying the child for the commissioning parents. </p>

<p>All parties involved are required to sign the finalised surrogacy agreement prior to the surrogate becoming pregnant.</p>

<p>Following the birth, the commissioning parents will have the child’s birth certificate, passport, and court documents confirming the child has been placed into their care as part of a surrogacy arrangement.</p>

<p>Whether the surrogacy arrangement was made in Australia or overseas, if the customer doesn’t have formal evidence as set out above, the arrangement could be a change of care and not a surrogacy arrangement. In these cases, the customer may have a permanent care order or parenting order for the child. These orders are not the same as a parentage orders and the arrangement and exceptional circumstances must been proven before the new customer is eligible for PPL.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Proof of entry to care for surrogacy</strong></p>

<p>After reviewing all of the information available, if the Service Officer cannot make a determination, refer the case to the Service Support Officer (SSO) via the Direct Referral to SSO webform. The SSO may then determine a referral to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk via the Online Form is required.</p>

<p><strong>Important&#58;</strong> Surrogacy agreement referrals are only required as part of the post-birth claim process. Before completing the referral ensure all details of the surrogacy arrangement and any relevant documentation have been provided by the customer. </p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-09020010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains links to the Direct Referral to SSO webform and the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online Query form. </p>

<p>If&#58;</p>

the child was entrusted to the customers care as part of a formal surrogacy arrangement, have they provided the surrogacy agreement and/or court documents to confirm?</li>

If the <strong>birth mother is in prison</strong> they can meet the primary carer rule if they gave birth in prison and can care for their child in prison or, if imprisoned after the birth, they continue to care for the child in prison</li>
		<li>
If the <strong>primary carer is temporarily unable to care for the child</strong>, they may remain eligible if it is due to circumstances beyond their control and the period is expected to be less than 26 weeks</li>

If the <strong>primary carer loses care of the child</strong>, they may remain eligible if care is&#58;</li>

disputed, and the customer takes reasonable steps to have the child returned to their care. This includes periods before a claim has been made</li>		</ul>

<p>If the customer's actual adjusted taxable income exceeds the income limit in the financial year prior to the date of claim, a second claim may be lodged.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer indicates in their online claim they have other income components, for example foreign income, negatively geared investments, net rental property losses etc. than a tax notice of assessment (NOA) issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will not be sufficient as evidence.

<p>If a customer is eligible for an exemption to the NARWP, it will apply for their full PPL period and any connected Flexible PPL days.

<p>The PPL period start date for a secondary claimant is determined by the primary claimant. Secondary claimants <strong>cannot</strong> nominate the start date for the PPL period.</p>

<p>In their claim, the primary claimant must nominate the start date for the PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Full transfer&#58;</strong> If the primary claimant is transferring all of their PPL period to the secondary claimant, the start date for the secondary claimant depends on the following factors&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Establishing the primary claimant's nominated start date (NSD)</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If proof of birth and an effective PPL claim are provided by the primary claimant's NSD, the secondary claimant’s PPL start date will be the primary claimant's NSD</li>

		<li>
If proof of birth and an effective PPL claim are provided after the NSD and <strong>more than</strong> 28 days after the birth/entrustment to care, the date the proof of birth and/or the date the claim is lodged will be the primary claimant’s NSD and therefore become the secondary claimant’s PPL start date<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the NSD can be backdated to the child’s date of birth/entrustment to care date if the customer&#58;</li>

<p><strong>Date the child enters the secondary claimant's primary care</strong></p>

<p>Primary claimants can give permission for another person to claim some or all of their 30 Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p><strong>PPL claim status</strong></p>

<p>The primary claimant’s PPL claim level status will be <strong>CZR-FLX</strong> (current zero rate) until all Flexible PPL days have been claimed. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes where the primary claimant has transferred their full entitlement.</p>

<p>This allows the primary claimant access to remove permission to claim any of the Flexible PPL days up to when they have been claimed by a secondary claimant.</p>
