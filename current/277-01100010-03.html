<p>When a customer or representative contacts Child Support by phone or face-to-face&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
provide an effective introduction. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a></li>
		<li>
conduct an identity check, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01020000-01.html">Authenticating a Child Support customer</a>, and</li>
		<li>
check if the customer is managed by another area</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer has been delivered to the wrong business area, for example due to not entering their CSRN&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
encourage them to enter their CSRN when prompted so they will be automatically directed to the appropriate area in future</li>
		<li>
tell them the call will be transferred to the appropriate area, and</li>
		<li>
cold transfer the call to the correct area using the routing tab in Services Australia Workspace, ensuring the 'POI done' checkbox is selected</li>
		</ul>
<p>In some situations a <strong>warm transfer may be more appropriate</strong>, examples are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Managing escalated customers</li>
		<li>
Ensuring customers are not repeatedly cold transferred between areas</li>
		<li>
To prevent customers having to repeatedly explain the purpose of their call</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more about what can be exchanged with an authorised representative, <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100010-04.html">References</a> has a link to the Guide 6.3.6&#58; Authorised representatives.</p>

<p><strong>Correspondence received</strong></p>

<p>When a customer or representative sends written correspondence via fax, email or post, undertake the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Review recent case events. Scrutinise the correspondence received ensuring it is correctly categorised. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01070000-01.html">Correspondence received in Child Support</a></li>
		<li>
Contact the customer or representative if necessary to discuss or clarify issues they have raised. Re-categorise the correspondence if appropriate</li>
		<li>
Address all matters raised in the correspondence. If a letter has not been issued as a result of the actions, contact the customer or representative to discuss further. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Delete intray after all issues raised have been addressed.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> re categorise or delete correspondence received intrays inappropriately. Doing this may have a detrimental effect on customers and cause distress. It can result in financial impacts and cause delays in processes such as Change of Assessment (COA) and Part6A Objections.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Common and Specialised Issues</strong></p>

<p>Identify why the customer has contacted Child Support. Use the list of Common and specialised activities to determine the issues to be managed or if referral to a specialist area is required. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100020-01.html">Common and specialised activities for Child Support staff</a>.</p>

<p>Issues must be managed at the point of entry wherever possible, regardless of whether the customer is already locked to another Service Officer.</p>

<p>Where there are multiple issues, the appropriate approach depends on the combination of common and/or specialised issues&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>multiple common issues</strong> are managed by the owning business area. This is generally where the customer first presents</li>
		<li>
<strong>combination of common and specialised issues</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the customer is already locked to a specialist area, the specialist area will manage all specialised and common issues, including Minimum Collection Activity</li>
			<li>
if the customer is not locked to a specialist area, common issues will be managed at the point of entry, including <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Customer_Management_Step07">Minimum Collection Activity</a>. Referral to the appropriate specialist area can occur once common issues have been progressed as far as possible in real time</li>
			<li>
specialist areas will take on outstanding common activities once a customer is locked to that area</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>multiple specialised issues</strong>&#58; a collaborative customer management approach applies between Service Officers in each specialist area</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a customer has multiple specialised issues, <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Initial_custome_Step04">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> sometimes customers present issues that Child Support is unable to help with, however these issues may hinder the customer's ability to manage their child support. Service Officers are responsible for identifying these customer issues and providing appropriate external referrals to organisations that can assist the customer. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01140000-01.html">Social worker and other service referrals for child support customers</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer identifies a non-child support related issue, consider if they should be referred to 1 of the external referral options identified on the <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Guides">Customer Support/Referral Guide</a>. This may occur before or after the child support issues are addressed.</p>

<p>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Guides">Customer Risk Identification Model</a> for conversational and administrative cues to help identify the most appropriate referral option.</p>

<p><strong>Correspondence received</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where alternative customer contact arrangements, special or preferred contact preferences has been provided update the Profile window</li>
		<li>
When contact with the customer or representative is necessary to discuss or clarify issues they have raised, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a></li>
		<li>
If unable to contact customer, send MX1-1 Request for client to contact CSA Letter</li>
		<li>
If customer wants written correspondence only, send a unique letter. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01060000-03.html">Step 2 Table 3 in Letters for Child Support customers</a></li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> re categorise or delete correspondence received intrays inappropriately. Doing this may have a detrimental effect on customers and cause distress. It can result in financial impacts and cause delays in processes such as COA and Part6A Objections.</p>

<p>When speaking with a customer there may be occasions where a Service Officer identifies an error, or that another Service Officer has not correctly followed the CMA. In these circumstances, the priority is to manage and resolve the customer issues <strong>at the point of entry</strong> wherever possible.</p>

<p>Where an error is identified the Service Officer will undertake the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
apologise for any errors that have occurred</li>
		<li>
if the customer wants to make a complaint, follow the guidelines in the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-01.html">Managing customer complaints and feedback </a>, and</li>
		<li>
take all steps to progress and/or resolve the issue in real time wherever possible</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the issue is unable to be resolved in real time&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the customer is <strong>already locked</strong> to another Service Officer, the Service Officer that identifies the error will take all necessary information and refer any follow up to the locked Service Officer for action</li>
		<li>
if the customer is <strong>not locked</strong> to a Service Officer, the Service Officer will lock the customer and manage all outstanding issues, including resolution of any errors as per <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>. In this situation, customers <strong>will not</strong> be locked back to the previous Service Officer</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Internal Feedback</strong></p>

<p>Where it is considered that the previous Service Officer would benefit from receiving feedback, staff can choose to send using the feedback tool. Before sending feedback, consider how it will contribute to improved customer service into the future.</p>

<p>Where there are multiple specialised issues, the following areas will generally retain ownership due to the nature of the issue or circumstances of the customer. In priority order these areas are&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Business Area</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Deceased Customer Management - payee and/or payer parent will stay locked</li>
		<li>
Personalised Services - payee and/or payer will stay locked</li>
		<li>
Litigation - payee and payer will stay locked</li>
		<li>
Departure Prohibition Order Team - payer will stay locked</li>
		<li>
Intensive Collection Services - payer will stay locked</li>
		<li>
New Customers (pending registration) - payee and payer will stay locked</li>
		<li>
Integrated Care (disputed care on new registrations and restarts) – lock payee and payer </li>
		</ul>
<p>If none of the above areas need to retain ownership, the customer should be locked to the area where the <strong>first specialised issue was received.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Disputed care on new registrations and restarts</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Complex Care Service Officers (CCSOs) will lock customers whilst managing <strong>Disputed Care</strong> but will not complete any registration activities</li>
		<li>
Pluto application for assessment (AFA) work items will remain with the Service Officer managing the registration</li>
		<li>
CCSOs will warm transfer the call to the Service Officer managing the registration if the customer needs to discuss the registration in progress.</li>
		<li>
When the care decision has been finalised and care recorded in dual systems, CCSO will return the registration to the Service Officer managing the registration for finalisation </li>
		<li>
The CCSO will lock the customer to the Service Officer who is assigned to the Pluto AFA work item and route the <strong>ASSMNT IN PROGRESS</strong> intray to them</li>

These registrations will need to be actioned in Cuba (not Pluto) due to care being recorded in Cuba</li>		</ul>

<p>Ownership can also be transferred by agreement if this is likely to result in a better service and/or customer outcome. Consider the following when determining whether to transfer ownership&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>amount of contact the issues are likely to generate - </strong>where 1 specialised issue is likely to generate significant customer contact, consider locking the customer(s) to the specialist area responsible for that issue, to minimise the number of call transfers required when the customer contacts Child Support</li>
		<li>
<strong>length of time the issues will take to resolve - </strong>where 1 issue is likely to take a longer period of time to resolve, consider locking the customer to the specialist area responsible for that issue, to minimise changes in ownership as other issues arise and are finalised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where it is in the best interest of the customer to be locked to another specialist area, contact the other area, by phone wherever possible, to determine who will retain customer ownership. This can be done at any time. If agreement about customer ownership cannot be reached, escalate the issue to the Team Leader.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers must not be advised of, or involved in, discussions about ownership.</p>

<p>To refer follow up work to another business area&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Create a Client Contact Required intray on the customer. Set the due date for 2 working days. Include a notepad detailing follow up action required, for example Pending care, pending NAP</li>
		<li>
If the other customer is already locked to a Service Officer, lock the customer to the same Service Officer, who will be responsible for finalising the issue</li>
		<li>
If the other customer is not locked to a Service Officer, refer the intray to the relevant position of the owning business area. Lock the associated customer to the same position so that both customers and all relevant intrays are identified and allocated to a Service Officer in the owning business area.
