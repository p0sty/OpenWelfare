Begin the restoration on the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen and then manually code the employment income on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen and finalise</li>

<p>Due to system limitations, Parenting Payment (PP) will not always cancel automatically at the end of an employment income nil rate period. For manual coding, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">Employment income nil rate period</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is a job seeker with a cancellation status of <strong>CAN-FTE</strong> and this status is incorrect as the customer only worked casually/part-time, investigation is required. Check the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen for previous 'Full Time On-going (<strong>FTO</strong>)' status coding.</p>

<p>If an <strong>FTO</strong> status was previously coded on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen, the system may have recognised the <strong>FTO</strong> coding and updated the Customer Employment Status Update (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen.

<p>There are system limitations relating to PPP customers when their partner's payment is suspended.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If an NSS partner of a PPP customer is suspended, any income recorded on the NSS partner record may not give the correct rate for the PPP customer. This is because no excess partner income can be calculated</li>
		<li>
If a PEN partner of a PPP customer is suspended, including Returned To Work (RTW), any income recorded on the PEN partner's record is incorrectly assessed using the pension Income Test. The correct Income Test used for the PPP customer must be the <a href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">partner not on pension, Austudy or YA</a> Income Test</li>
		</ul>
<p>In both the above circumstances, do not restore the partner's record. Apply a manual rate for the PPP customer. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">Coding a manual rate of payment</a>.</p>

calculate the rate, and</li>

<p>The STP Employer Wage Items (<strong>EMGI</strong>) screen will present when there are STP pay event details in the current reporting period. STP data is displayed across three tables&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>STP Income Details</strong> - displays a high level view of the employer's details, the total reported Gross STP Income amount and the customer's reporting period</li>

<strong>Income details</strong> - a detailed view of all pay components for each pay event. Further information is to be coded on this level when required, with any changes needed as advised by the customer. </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers retain control of the information they submit in their reporting statement. It is the customer’s responsibility to review any pre-filled STP data, advise of any updates needed and confirm the income paid as per their payslip details. No evidence is required if the customer changes the provisional STP employment details, prior to confirming the data. Staff <strong>must make notes</strong> about any changes the customer has advised in the Notes field before finalising the transaction. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Discuss the pre-filled employment income displayed with the customer. If required, changes can be made to the pre-filled data by selecting Edit next to the Wage Item </li>
		<li>
Pay Period Start and End Dates can be added where required </li>
		<li>
Pre-filled STP income can be adjusted to zero but cannot be deleted</li>
		<li>
The<strong> Pay Event Date</strong> cannot be edited. If the customer advises the pay event date is incorrect, the pre-filled data will need to be zeroed and then added back in with the correct date of event </li>

<p>If the customer advises of payslip details that did not pre-fill, staff can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
add additional pay components, via <strong>New Income Details</strong> on the Income Details table</li>
		<li>
add additional pay events, via the <strong>New Pay Event Detail</strong> on the Pay Events table</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer advises of regular discrepancies in the pre-filled STP data, staff must request payslips and lodge a mySupport request. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-01.html">Single Touch Payroll (STP)</a>. </p>

<p>Once all income has been verified by the customer, select <strong>Accept Income</strong> to confirm the data. Repeat for each STP employer. <strong>Accept Income</strong> will become greyed out and can only be selected again if changes are made. Select <strong>Next</strong>.</p>

<p>The accepted assessable income will be automatically loaded onto the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen with a LOP frequency. Any confirmed unused leave and redundancy payments paid when a customer has ceased employment for an STP employer will be automatically loaded onto the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen.

<p>Continuous income frequencies (<strong>1WE</strong>, <strong>2WE</strong> and <strong>MTE</strong>) can only be recorded in limited circumstances. Customers cannot select a continuous frequency through self-service channels and must contact to determine eligibility (with the exception of customers whose records are in Environment I with an overseas address).</p>

<p>It is the Service Officer's responsibility to determine if the customer is eligible to have a continuous income frequency applied. Where a continuous income frequency is recorded, the Service Officer must include how the customer has met the exception criteria in the Finalisation notes or in a separate <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Check if the customer is paid regular income and meets either the 1WE or 2WE exception or the Pension Monthly Exception Rule.</p>

<p><strong>If the customer is paid irregular income or does not meet either exception</strong>, they must be placed onto statement reporting and income will be recorded with a non-continuous frequency (<strong>IOP/LOP</strong>).<br>For more information, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-05.html#bp05_L3TT_Ceasing_or_conv">Resources</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If a continuous frequency is already recorded, or one is being recorded within a retrospective update</strong>, staff should ensure that the exception criteria are still met. If not, the exemption should be ceased and the customer (and/or their partner) must be placed onto statement reporting, if applicable and income will be recorded with a non-continuous frequency (<strong>IOP/LOP</strong>).

<p><strong>Verifying the correction</strong></p>

<p>If an <a href="../people-with-disability/008-02010000-01.html">ADE employer</a> has reported a customer's income from employment electronically, contact the National Business Gateway team.</p>

<p>If the customer is advising of a correction to previously confirmed STP employment income, verification is required (via payslips or a letter from the employer).</p>

<p>Verification for correction of non-STP employment income details should only be requested where the details were previously updated during a review or data matching. If the customer is providing an update to an amount they or their partner had previously advised, then it can be updated without verification.</p>

<p>If verification is required for the correction, see <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-01.html">Requesting information (CLK)</a>. No changes should be made until the evidence is provided.</p>

<p>To update details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select <strong>Yes</strong> to <strong>Do you want to update income for a past period?</strong></li>
		<li>
Enter a date range for the period that requires an update and select <strong>Search</strong></li>
		<li>
Select the reporting period(s) that requires an update and select <strong>Next</strong></li>
		<li>
Where STP data is present for the relevant period that requires an update, the EMGI screen will present each reporting period one at a time until all periods have been actioned</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For an STP employer</strong></p>

<p><strong>C</strong>orrection of STP income must be actioned on the <strong>EMGI</strong> screen. Do not update directly on <strong>EAPP/IMPS</strong>. Where there are entitlement periods that require an update, these will present one at a time until all periods have been actioned. Once <strong>Accept Income</strong> has been selected, the changes are mapped to the <strong>EAPP </strong>screen.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If unconfirmed STP data on <strong>EMGI</strong> is being reviewed, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Employment_inco01_Step04">go to Step 4</a></li>
		<li>
If previously confirmed STP data on <strong>EMGI</strong> needs updating, select <strong>Edit</strong> for the <strong>Event Date</strong> of the employment income that needs correcting</li>
		<li>
Once updates are made, select <strong>Accept Income </strong>and then <strong>Next</strong></li>
		<li>
The updated STP income will automatically update on <strong>EAPP</strong>. Staff must check the updated income has applied to <strong>EAPP</strong>, as required, before continuing </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> STP income that is zeroed on <strong>EMGI</strong> does not zero the previously confirmed pay event on <strong>EAPP</strong>, as the system does not apply zero income. In this instance, staff must delete the previously confirmed pay event on <strong>EAPP</strong> that was zeroed on <strong>EMGI</strong>. </p>

<p>Where employment income was previously coded directly on <strong>EAPP</strong> and STP data is now being reviewed, make sure the manually coded income is deleted. This can be identified with <strong>NVE</strong> verification code.</p>

<p><strong>For a non-STP employer</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Identify the employer on the <strong>EANS</strong> screen that requires correction and open the twisty to display the confirmed details on the <strong>EAPP</strong> table</li>
		<li>
<strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong> actions are available next to the confirmed pay event, only delete information if it has been recorded in error</li>

		<li>
Select the reason for correcting the existing information in the <strong>Change Reason</strong> field, then select <strong>Save</strong></li>

<p>All employment income paid must be reported. This includes employment income that is paid when the customer and/or partner is travelling overseas. Customer should advise this income before leaving Australia to ensure their income is assessed correctly.</p>

<p>If a statement reporter leaves Australia, they are re-profiled as a notification reporter from the date the customer leaves Australia. Notification reporter provisions do apply and the customer must still advise of changes within the required timeframe. For information about payment specific portability rules, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01000000-01.html">Leaving Australia and portability of payments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Customers who are not payable outside Australia</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are not payable outside Australia but are paid employment income whilst overseas must still report this income.</p>

<p>The system will profile statement reporters to a notification reporter when payment is suspended due to an overseas departure.</p>

<p>If the customer is a statement reporter and will be paid <strong>employment income on or after their departure</strong>, they must report their income on the business day before departure to ensure they do not incur an overpayment. The date of event (DOV) for income will be the date paid. The income is still spread across the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>If the customer is partnered and their partner will leave on a different date or is not going with them, any employment income for either member of the couple must be coded on the earliest departure date.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to advise employment income before departure, the customer may incur an overpayment.</p>

<p>Do not change the Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) to an earlier date prior to departure; the system will issue any entitlement after departure.</p>

<p><strong>Customers who continue to be payable and receive employment income while overseas</strong></p>

<p>Customers who are statement reporters in the fortnight of departure must report before departure for the correct payment to be made. The date of event (DOV) for income in the period will be the date the employment income is paid. The income is still spread across the full entitlement period.</p>

<p>If they are partnered and their partner will leave on a different date or is not going with them, any employment income paid for either member of the couple must be coded on the earliest departure date.</p>

<p>For customers receiving employment income (that is, leave payments) while overseas due to a temporary absence from employment, their income will continue to be assessed.</p>

<p>Due to system limitations, Parenting Payment (PP) will not always cancel automatically at the end of an employment income nil rate period. For manual coding, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">Employment income nil rate period</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is a jobseeker with a cancellation status of <strong>CAN-FTE</strong> and this status is incorrect as the customer only worked casually/part-time, investigation is required. Check the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen for previous 'Full Time On-going (<strong>FTO</strong>)' status coding.</p>

<p>If an <strong>FTO</strong> status was previously coded on the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen, the system may have recognised the <strong>FTO</strong> coding and updated the Customer Employment Status Update (<strong>EAES</strong>) screen. To correct this, code the following on <strong>EAPP</strong> for the relevant employer&#58;</p>

<p>There are system limitations relating to PPP customers when their partner's payment is suspended.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If an NSS partner of a PPP customer is suspended, any income recorded on the NSS partner record may not give the correct rate for the PPP customer. This is because no excess partner income can be calculated</li>
		<li>
If a PEN partner of a PPP customer is suspended, including Returned To Work (RTW), any income recorded on the PEN partner's record is incorrectly assessed using the pension Income Test. The correct Income Test used for the PPP customer must be the <a href="../utils/RatesChart/rateschart.html">partner not on pension, Austudy or YA</a> Income Test</li>
		</ul>
<p>In both the above circumstances, do not restore the partner's record. Apply a manual rate for the PPP customer. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08180000-01.html">Coding a manual rate of payment</a>.</p>
