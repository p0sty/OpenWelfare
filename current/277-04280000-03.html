<p><strong>Centrelink deductions</strong> - payments deducted from <a href="../separated-parents/277-04070000-01.html">Centrelink payments</a> or from Parental Leave Payments (PLP).</p>

<p>Cuba is currently unable to administer Centrelink deductions for s143 parentage overpayment orders. This will be updated when the option becomes available in a future Cuba release. Where the payer of a S143 order refuses to negotiate a suitable <a href="../separated-parents/277-04120000-01.html">debt repayment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</strong> <strong>deductions</strong> - <a href="../separated-parents/277-04100000-01.html">payments deducted from a DVA pension or allowance</a>. </p>

<p>At registration, inform payers that child support payments can be deducted from their salary, Centrelink, PLP or Veterans' Affairs payments. The benefits of these payment methods are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is no cost to the payer</li>
		<li>
it makes paying child support easy and convenient, and</li>
		<li>
reduces the risk of accruing a child support debt</li>
		</ul>
<p>PLP is usually administered by Centrelink, but some employers may elect to administer the entitlement instead. Child Support can request deductions from this entitlement regardless of who is administering it.</p>

<p>If payers do not want to use EW, they must make an <a href="../separated-parents/277-04150000-01.html">election for salary deductions not to apply</a>. If the election for EW not to apply is accepted, explain that failure to make payments on time will result in enforcement action such as EW, Centrelink deductions or TRIPs, without further notice. Clearly <a href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">document the conversation</a> and process the election in Cuba to enable a Service Officer to follow up collection action if required.</p>

<p>If payments are deducted from salary or Centrelink payments, some outstanding child support liabilities may not be covered by the deductions because of the time they take to establish. These payments must be paid manually. Arrange <a href="../separated-parents/277-04120000-01.html">debt repayment</a> of the outstanding amount by Employer Withholding with Arrears (EWA) or manual payments.</p>

<p>Some examples of when this may occur are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a new case starts and salary deductions are not established immediately, or</li>
		<li>
the maximum Centrelink deduction only covers their ongoing liability</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Has the payer elected to pay via a manual or direct credit method?</strong></p>

<p>Payers making payments manually or via direct credit can select a payment frequency. The available payment frequencies are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
weekly</li>
		<li>
fortnightly</li>
		<li>
4 weekly</li>
		<li>
calendar monthly (any date between the 2nd and the 28th), and</li>
		<li>
monthly (the 1st of the month)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A payer's nominated pay frequency will determine their periodic liability calculations in the following ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Weekly - daily rate x 7</li>
		<li>
Fortnightly - daily rate x 14</li>
		<li>
Four weekly - daily rate x 28</li>
		<li>
Calendar monthly - daily rate x 30.4375</li>
		<li>
Monthly - daily rate x 30.4375</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly and Calendar Monthly – determining start date</strong></p>

<p>If a payer elects to pay monthly, the payment period will always be from the first day of the month until the last day of the month. If a payer elects to pay calendar monthly they must nominate the start date of their payment period, for example from the 15th day of each month, until the 14th of the following month. Payment frequencies default to monthly.</p>

<p><strong>Changing payment frequency </strong></p>

<p>A payer can elect to change the payment frequency part way through a payment period. The due date for the partial payment period will be 7 days after the end of the original payment period, on the original due date as if there had been no interruption.</p>

<p>Payment options can also start in the future. When a payer selects a new frequency, both the payment date and the period of coverage of the liability will be changed. The payer must nominate the start date of their first payment period for the new frequency (this must be a future day). Payments are always due 7 days after the end date of the payment period.</p>

<p>A preferred payment date can be nominated. In this situation, work backwards to calculate the first date of their payment period.</p>

<p>When selecting calendar monthly frequency, the effective start date cannot be after the 28th of the month. If the customer's preferred payment date will fall into this period, negotiate another effective start date between the 2nd and 28th of the month.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>&#58; A customer is currently paying monthly. The payment cycle runs from the 1st of the month until the last day of the month and is due for payment on the 7th of the following month. On the 5th May the payer elects to begin paying fortnightly with their first payment due on the 22nd May. The matching cycle would be running from 2nd May to 15th May, due date 22nd May because this cycle would be starting before the election date child support cannot start the new payment arrangement then. The applicable payment cycle will be running from 16th May to 29th May, due date 5th June. The liability must now be paid in 2 parts.</p>

<p>The 1st - 15th May is due on the 7th June as this was part of the original monthly cycle and was always due on the 7th of the following month. The new period 16th May - 29th May is due on the 5th June (7 days after the completion of their new fortnightly cycle).</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>&#58; A payer is currently paying monthly. The payment cycle runs from the 1st of the month until the last day of the month and is due for payment on the 7th of the following month. On the 5th February the payer elects to begin paying monthly with their first payment due on the 22nd February. The payment period would be running from 16th January to 15th February, due date 22nd February; as this payment period would be starting before the payer's election date (5th February) Child Support cannot start the new payment arrangement then. The relevant payment period will run from 16th February to 15th March, due date 22nd March. The liability must now be paid in 2 parts.</p>

<p>The 1st - 15th February is due on the 7th March as this was part of the original monthly cycle and was always due on the 7th of the following month. The new period 16th February to 15th March is due on the 22nd March (7 days after the completion of their new monthly cycle).</p>

<p>The frequency of the payment arrangement must match the frequency of the Periodic Liability Amount to avoid payment default intrays.</p>

<p>If the payer has selected a payment frequency, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04280000-03.html#bp03_tbl_General_payment_4">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

<p>BPAY payments are made via a financial institution's telephone or internet banking service. These payments can be made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Some financial institutions do not allow BPAY payments using credit cards.</p>

<p>BPAY payments take approximately 2 to 3 working days; including the day of payment, to be credited to the parent's account.</p>

<p>Direct Credit is the transfer of funds directly from the customer's bank account to the Child Support account. Direct credit can be arranged with the customer's financial institution.</p>

<p>Payments can generally also be made through internet banking. Internet payments can be made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These payments can be transferred on an ad hoc basis as well as being programmed to transfer automatically on a pre-determined date.</p>

<p>Direct Credit payments can take approximately 2-3 working days including the day of payment, to be credited to a customer's account.</p>

<p>Cut off times for Direct Credit transfers are around 5&#58;00pm however this varies with each financial institution.</p>

<p>If the payment is not showing, confirm the bank account the customer transferred the funds to.

If not, the customer needs to contact their financial institution to recover the funds on their behalf.</p>

<p>If the bank account details and CRN keyed into the Payment Reference field are correct, Child Support will need to investigate further as the payment may be sitting in the Suspense Account. To initiate a payment search in the Suspense Account, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04280000-03.html#bp03_tbl_General_payment_5">Step 5 in Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Advise the customer to contact their financial institution or internet banking helpdesk for assistance.</p>

<p>There are various reasons why cheques can be dishonoured and in some circumstances, a customer might not know why this has happened. When a payment is dishonoured, the debit to the child support account is accompanied by a reason code such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a stop/cancelled cheque request applied</li>
		<li>
insufficient cleared funds being available, or</li>
		<li>
insufficient funds</li>
