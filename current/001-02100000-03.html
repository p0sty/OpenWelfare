<p>If a customer wants to start a small business or is already running a micro-business, they can access Small Business Training. This accredited training course helps job seekers gain a nationally recognised qualification and is appropriate to starting and/or running a small business. Depending on the type of proposed new business, or existing micro business, the Self-Employment Assistance provider will refer the job seeker to either a&#58;</p>

		<li>
New Business Ventures Skill Set (BSBSS00103)</li>
		<li>
Small Business Management Skill Set (BSBSS00104)</li>
		</ul>
<p>During the training, job seekers will develop a Business Plan. This will need approval from their Self-Employment Assistance provider.</p>

<p>When a JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (job seeker) (YA), Parenting Payment Single (PPS - not PNX) or Special Benefit (SpB) job seeker with mutual obligation requirements commences Small Business Training, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) send an advice to notify Services Australia. The activity will auto-display on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen in Process Direct with the activity type code '<strong>Small Business Training</strong>'.</p>

<p>To view an approved activity in Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Key '<strong>AEX</strong>' in the <strong>Super Key</strong>, select <strong>Enter</strong></li>
		<li>
The Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) will display activity type '<strong>Small Business Training</strong>' with start and end dates as per DEWR's advice</li>
		</ul>
<p>For Disability Support Payment (DSP) customers with participation requirements and participating in Small Business Training, the <strong>AEX</strong> screen will not display the '<strong>Small Business Training</strong>' activity. To view details in this activity&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
access the <strong>Participation Summary</strong> page in Process Direct</li>
		<li>
select the <strong>Activity type/Non-applied exemptions</strong> tab</li>
		</ul>
<p>In addition&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

include 'Small Business Training/Coaching' as required</li>
		</ul>
<p>For details on negotiating a DSP Participation Plan, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090060-01.html">Disability Support Pension (DSP) Participation Plan</a>.</p>

<p>Job seekers will be able to attend the Small Business Training activity, prior to the Small Business Coaching commencement date. They can record their attendance as part of their points based activity (PBA). Job seekers undertaking Small Business Training may be eligible for EdEP. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08050000-01.html">Education Entry Payment (EdEP)</a> for information on eligibility and coding requirements.</p>

<p>Participation in Small Business Training fully satisfies the customer's requirements and the customer will continue to receive their income support payment for the duration of their Small Business Training. The customer continues to be managed by their employment services provider. The employment services provider should negotiate a Job Plan with the customer and include the Small Business Training activity.</p>

<p>The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) send an advice to notify Services Australia when a job seeker in receipt of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) or Special Benefit (SpB) (under JSP conditions) has commenced in Small Business Coaching under Self-Employment Assistance. The <strong>Small Business Coaching</strong> activity will auto-display on the Activity and Exemption Summary (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen. If the customer is also receiving the 'Self-Employment Allowance', the details will display on the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>JSP and SpB job seekers, who are undertaking Small Business Coaching and eligible for a partial rate of income support payment, will be deemed as fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements. As such, Small Business Coaching participants (apart from those with DES or PNX providers) are managed by Services Australia. They will be exited from their Workforce Australia Service provider's caseload, as they will not be required to attend any provider appointments.

<p>When the Small Business Coaching activity notification is received from DEWR, the job seeker's income support payable rate (including add-ons) will be reduced by the amount of Self-Employment Allowance received (direct deduction, dollar-for-dollar). Self-Employment Allowance is paid at the 'single, 22 or over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP) which will often be more than the job seeker's rate of income support, and will usually reduce the income support rate to nil.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is receiving a higher rate of JSP or SpB, they may have an ongoing entitlement to a partial rate of income support payment in addition to Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>Where a customer's rate is reduced to <strong>nil</strong> due to Self-Employment Allowance and earnings combined, their income support payment status may display as '<strong>current at nil rate (CUR/CZR)</strong>'. The Income support payment will auto cancel after 6 consecutive fortnights of <strong>nil</strong> rate.</p>

<p>The Services Australia system will automatically code the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with the event start date, amount and payment frequency of Self-Employment Allowance as per advice received from DEWR. No coding is required.</p>

<p>Prior to 3 December 2022, some JSP or SpB customers in receipt of Self-Employment Allowance who were eligible for higher rates were coded with a manual top-up rate of income support. For information about continuing to pay manual rate of JSP or SpB as well as Self-Employment Allowance, see the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>JSP, YA and SpB job seekers who receive Self-Employment Allowance from DEWR and that results in the cancellation of their income support payment from Services Australia, may be eligible for a Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).

<p>When a Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) job seeker commences Small Business Coaching, the activity will not display on the Activities and Exemptions (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>PPP job seekers who change from income support payment to Self-Employment Allowance may also be entitled to a partial rate payment from Services Australia. Self-Employment Allowance is paid at the 'single, 22 or over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP). PPP (including add-ons) is reduced by the amount of Self-Employment Allowance received (direct deduction, dollar-for-dollar), which will often be more than the job seeker's former rate of PPP, and will usually reduce the PPP rate to nil.</p>

<p>Therefore, most job seekers in receipt of PPP will be auto-cancelled upon receipt of Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>An activity sent by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), auto codes the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen with the event start date, amount and payment frequency of Self-Employment Allowance. No coding is required.</p>

<p>Where a Small Business Coaching participant receives Self-Employment Allowance from their provider, it is paid for the first 39 of the 52 weeks of Small Business Coaching only. After this time, they can re-test their eligibility for income support payment (if their payments were cancelled), or have their rate of payment reassessed with no further direct deductions due to Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>These participants will receive a letter from their Self-Employment Assistance provider with details of their final payment of Self-Employment Allowance. The letter will tell them to contact Centrelink to determine eligibility to any ongoing payments, including reclaiming income support if they were cancelled. The letter advises the participants to show Centrelink this letter as evidence of the cessation of Self-Employment Allowance. Check that the Small Business Coaching participant has uploaded this letter to their record.</p>

<p>Small Business Coaching participants still receiving a partial rate of a payment will have their Self-Employment Allowance automatically zeroed from the 'Allowance End Date +1' as advised by DEWR.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>OGP</strong> screen to ensure Self-Employment Allowance has been <strong>zeroed</strong>. Otherwise, their claim will reject '<strong>CPP</strong> - Customer on Precluding Payment' or '<strong>SEA</strong> - Self Employment Allowance'.</p>

<p>The letter from the Self-Employment Assistance provider is the only evidence required to manually zero off Self-Employment Allowance from the date Self-Employment Allowance ceased. Ensure the letter has been provided by the participant and scanned to their record. If necessary, for example, participant has lost their letter, contact the Self-Employment Assistance provider to get confirmation of the Self-Employment Allowance cessation end date.</p>

<p>If needed, zero the Self-Employment Allowance on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen with a date of effect of the last date paid Self-Employment Allowance plus 1.</p>

<p>Where the participant is already past their 52 week Small Business Coaching period&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
no evidence is required to manually zero off the Self-Employment Allowance on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen. Use a date of effect of either&#58;</li>

			<li>
52 weeks from their Small Business Coaching start date</li>

<p><strong>Manual Rate on Rate Component Override (RCO) screen</strong></p>

<p>If a JSP, YAL or SpB job seeker was receiving a partial rate of payment via a manual rate override during Small Business Coaching participation, <strong>end the manual rate override</strong> from the date payment is being granted or reassessed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there are <strong>no special backdating provisions</strong> applying to job seekers claiming or requesting reassessments following Self-Employment Allowance cessation.</p>

<p>Small Business Coaching participants whose rate was reduced by NEIS/Self-Employment Allowance will have this automatically zeroed on the <strong>OGP</strong> screen at 39 weeks. Self-Employment Allowance for these customers <strong>does not</strong> need to be manually zeroed to restore payment back to full rate.</p>
