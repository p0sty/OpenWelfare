<p>This document explains details about when a ParentsNext participant may be exempt or exited from the ParentsNext program. Taking part in ParentsNext is now voluntary, however eligibility for ParentsNext will still be automatically determined by the system. For further information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18101001-01.html">ParentsNext eligibility and servicing</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Application of the Caring for Child not eligible for Carer Payment (CCE) Exemption</strong></p>

<p>Since 5 May 2023, the Government removed compulsory participation requirements for ParentsNext customers. This means customers selected as compulsory for the program can choose to participate voluntarily, however they will continue to appear as compulsory in the system.</p>

<p>The system cannot exit or convert a compulsory participant to voluntary participant. In order to bypass compulsory requirements, the Department Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) has endorsed use of the long term <strong>Caring for Child not eligible for Carer Payment (CCE)</strong> exemption for customers who display as compulsory. This will enable voluntary participation until the program is abolished after July 2024.</p>

<p>Service Officers can code a CCE exemption for customers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have a participation status of compulsory and are referred to a ParentsNext provider</li>
		<li>
do not attend three Services Australia ParentsNext appointments</li>
		<li>
do not have evidence to support a short term exemption</li>
		</ul>
<p>In limited circumstances, the CCE exemption can be used on a discretionary basis if the customer does not consent to an appointment with a ParentsNext provider.</p>

<p><strong>Application of all other exemptions</strong></p>

<p>If customer advises they cannot participate due to their current situation, Service Officers will continue to apply a short term exemption that aligns with their circumstances.</p>

<p>The majority of <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> exemptions are applicable for ParentsNext participants however, there are some circumstances where the exemption type and coding differ for ParentsNext participants.</p>

<p>There are two exemptions available to ParentsNext participants that are not available to jobseekers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Temporary Period of Confinement exemption</li>
		<li>
Bereavement exemption</li>
		</ul>
<p>ParentsNext exemptions can be recorded by either the agency or the ParentsNext provider. This will ensure customer is not subject to the Targeted Compliance Framework whilst participation requirements are removed. The exemption also results in the suspension of provider servicing which means the provider can add a voluntary participation period.</p>

<p>The granting of an exemption does not change a ParentsNext participant's eligibility status or their reason for selection. Exemptions applied by the agency or a ParentsNext provider, will display on the <strong>ParentsNext Summary</strong> page in Customer First, under the heading of Current Exemptions and on the Activities and Exemption (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen in Process Direct.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-18041800-05.html">Resources</a> page for a list of all the available exemptions that can be applied to ParentsNext participants by the agency and by ParentsNext providers including the duration of each exemption type.</p>

<p><strong>Family and domestic violence</strong></p>

<p>This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the customer is with another person, on speaker phone or has already identified family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current business conversation. Otherwise, go to the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence procedure</a> to conduct the risk identification and referral process.</p>

<p>In cases of family and domestic violence, the customer should be referred to a Services Australia social worker. Consideration should be given to the assessment made by the social worker as to whether an exemption should apply and the appropriate length of the exemption. The initial exemption must be for the maximum 16 week period. This may be extended for one or more further periods of up to 16 weeks if appropriate. The duration of the further periods of exemption will again be determined by the social worker's assessment, as part of their review of the customer's circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Action at the end of an exemption</strong></p>

<p>If a customer was not yet referred to a ParentsNext provider at the time the exemption was recorded by the agency, the system will automatically book an appointment with the agency for a time after the exemption has ended. Exemptions recorded by the agency will be automatically end dated if a customer exits the program.</p>

<p>If an exemption is applied after the customer has already been referred to a ParentsNext provider, it will be the responsibility of the ParentsNext provider to re-engage with the customer at the end of the exemption. The agency does not need to undertake any follow up at the end of the exemption period in this instance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> some exemptions may need social work intervention and recommendation (for example, in the situation where a customer is experiencing extreme stress, or homelessness because of a relationship breakdown). The social worker may make an assessment and provide a recommendation about whether an exemption should be granted. Any Service Officer (APS 3 and above) can assess and grant Service Australia exemptions available for ParentsNext participants. Service Officers <strong>must</strong> not send a referral to the social work team to code a ParentsNext exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Extending an exemption</strong></p>

<p>An exemption can be extended provided that the customer's circumstances about the exemption remain current. Service Officers must confirm that the customer is still eligible for the exemption. If not, consider whether another exemption type is more appropriate for their circumstances.</p>

<p>If an exemption is extended or a new exemption is required, then the same process will need to be followed as coding the initial exemption period. See relevant process for each exemption type.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>ParentsNext Temporary Period of Confinement exemption</strong></p>

<p>The Temporary Period of Confinement (PTC) exemption is specific to the ParentsNext program and applies where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer is pregnant and the birth of the child is expected within 6 weeks, or</li>
		<li>
a new child under the age of 9 months enters the customer's care</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers are required to provide evidence of the expected date of birth/child entered care. Evidence of the expected date of delivery can include a letter from a doctor or registered midwife. It does not need to be a Services Australia medical certificate.</p>

<p>If a customer cannot provide evidence of their circumstances a CCE exemption can be coded to exempt them from participating. A referral should always be offered to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>ParentsNext bereavement exemption</strong></p>

<p>The bereavement exemption may be granted for ParentsNext participants for a maximum period of 16 weeks and is specific to ParentsNext. It is relevant to the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Death of a partner</li>
			<ul>			<li>
When a ParentsNext participant's partner passes away, they may be considered for a bereavement exemption (different to the bereavement mutual obligation exemption) of up to 16 weeks</li>
			<li>
If the Miscellaneous Update Details (<strong>NMIS</strong>) screen is coded in relation to the partner's death a mutual obligation Bereavement Period - Partner exemption will be automatically granted for a maximum of 14 weeks</li>
			<li>
The manual bereavement exemption should still be coded to make sure the customer is granted the maximum period of 16 weeks allowable for PP customers</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Death of an immediate family member - When a ParentsNext participant has an immediate family member pass away, a bereavement exemption (different to the bereavement mutual obligation exemption) should be coded</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Customer is pregnant when partner passes away</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is pregnant at the time their partner passes away, they will be exempt for a period of 16 weeks from the date of death or to the end of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. The <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120030-01.html">Bereavement Period - Pregnant Partner</a> exemption is automatically coded based on coding of the partner's death on the Miscellaneous Update Details (<strong>NMIS</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If the customer is still displaying as a compulsory ParentsNext participant when the expected date of birth is reached the system will automatically apply a ParentsNext temporary period of confinement exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Caring Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>If a ParentsNext participant has caring responsibilities, the Special Family Circumstances exemption can be applied for up to 16 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the specific caring exemption is not available for ParentsNext participants as the maximum duration is limited to 14 weeks (applicable to job seekers).</p>

<p>If the customer has long term caring responsibilities (foster carer, non-parent carer, home schooling), see <a href="../job-seekers/001-09120030-01.html">Exempting a job seeker from mutual obligation requirements due to special circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>Once a customer has been selected for ParentsNext, a change of circumstances may result in them being automatically exited from the program. This is because they no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>If a customer does not wish to participate in ParentsNext now that participation is voluntary, unless they meet the exit criteria, they will not be able to exit from the program. In these cases, an exemption must be applied.</p>

<p>ParentsNext participants will be automatically exited from the program by the system when one of the following occurs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their youngest Parenting Payment (PP) child turns 6 years of age</li>
		<li>
their PP cancels for any reason, including cancelling for failing to report (FRP)</li>

are currently studying or</li>

<p>The provider will assess their circumstances and the customer can opt out of the program after a discussion with the provider.</p>

<p>Only ParentsNext providers have the delegation to exit a ParentsNext participant where they are satisfied their employment is 'stabilised'. Stabilised earnings are defined as an average of at least 15 hours of paid employment per week that is expected to be ongoing. This can include self-employment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a provider records an exit due to stabilised earnings, a review is automatically created on the customer's record within the Services Australia system. This review will mature 14 days after the exit and will determine whether the customer is declaring income. If no income has been declared to the agency within 14 days of the exit, the customer will be automatically re-selected for ParentsNext. In this scenario, an alert notification is sent to their provider to re-engage with the customer, as they are not declaring income.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>do not have the discretion or delegation</strong> to apply a manual exit, and <strong>do not</strong> have the required access to do so.</p>

<p>If a customer is experiencing ongoing personal issues that are impacting on their ability to participate, they can discuss their eligibility for an exemption with their ParentsNext provider or the agency. In the case of future study or employment, the provider will determine if this should be included as an activity within their participation plan.
