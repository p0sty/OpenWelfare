<p>Section 20(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 requires that the Medicare benefit be paid to the person who <strong>incurs</strong> the medical expense in respect of the service.</p>

<p>A <strong>claimant</strong> is the person who incurred the medical costs for a service rendered.</p>

<p>The claimant can submit the claim via any claiming channel.</p>

<p>If the claimant chooses to lodge the claim via post, the claimant must complete a Medicare Claim form (MS014) and sign the declaration. The <a href="../your-health/011-43010040-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the MS014.</p>

<p>The claimant must be identified for each claim processed. The Medicare benefit is to be paid to the claimant.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Identify claimant for all claims</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Service Officer must ensure that the claimant is identified for <strong>all</strong> claims irrespective of any obvious relationship between them and the patient.</p>

<p>For example, Joanna has seen the doctor. Joanna's friend, Sandy pays for the services provided to Joanna. This makes Sandy the claimant. Sandy is entitled to claim a Medicare benefit for incurring the expense. Sandy and Joanna do not need to be on the same card for Sandy to be paid the Medicare benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a person pays for a medical service and is seeking a Medicare benefit they must be recorded as the claimant.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The Government announced in the 2015-16 budget that payment of Medicare benefits will cease to be paid via cheques from 1 July 2016. From 1 July 2016, payments are to be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT).</p>

<p>Funds will be deposited into the claimant’s nominated bank account. Where the claimant does not have valid EFT details stored in the Consumer Directory Management system (CDMS) or cannot provide valid temporary or permanent EFT details at the time the claim is submitted, the payment for the claim will be held until EFT details have been provided.</p>

<p>A run will be actioned each night to search CDMS and identify any new EFT details for a claimant that has a ‘HELD’ payment. Where new details are found the system will insert these EFT details into the BREFTE redirect table. These details will be picked up and processed in the next payment run for payment to the claimant.</p>

<p>All third party claimants (for example, football clubs) will need to provide temporary bank details on the Medicare claim form (MS014). </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When claiming Medicare benefits at a service centre, the claimant is required to produce their Medicare card.</p>

<p>This policy covers situations where a claimant cannot produce a Medicare card when claiming their Medicare benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> either a physical or a digital Medicare card is acceptable.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Claimant_unable_to_p"></a>
<h3>Claimant unable to produce a Medicare card</h3>


<p>Prior to a Medicare benefit being paid, two forms of identification must be provided <strong>or</strong> a <a href="../your-health/011-40020000-01.html">security check</a> performed where either the claimant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Cannot produce their Medicare card</li>

		</ul><a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Claimant_identificat"></a>
<h3>Claimant identification where claimant unable to produce a Medicare card</h3>


<p>Photographic identification is preferable, however where this is unavailable, identification containing the claimant's name and signature will suffice.</p>

<p>Acceptable identification documents include a <strong>current</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
government issued proof of age card</li>

provide a brief notation on the printed receipt (office copy) indicating that identification was sighted, for example, ID sighted, ID checked</li>
		<li>
record any identification numbers associated with the type of identification provided by the claimant, for example, driver's licence numbers</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Security check</strong></p>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Claimant_unable_to_p01"></a>
<h3>Claimant unable to provide proof of identity when unable to provide a Medicare card</h3>


<p>A benefit is not to be paid where one or more of the following apply.</p>

<p>Where the claimant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is unable to provide acceptable identification</li>
		<li>
did not pass the security check</li>

appears to be less than 14 years old, and cannot prove otherwise by student ID</li>
		</ul><a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Claimant_and_patient"></a>
<h3>Claimant and patient on different card numbers</h3>


<p>Where the claimant and patient are on different card numbers, the claimant's details are captured and recorded during the processing of the claim.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this process is not available via the Express Plus Medicare mobile app.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Claimant_not_entitle"></a>
<h3>Claimant not entitled to Medicare benefits but incurred the cost for an eligible patient</h3>


<p>If a claimant is not eligible for Medicare but incurred the cost for an eligible patient under Section 20(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 requires that the Medicare benefit be paid to the person who <strong>incurs</strong> the medical expense in respect of the service.</p>

<p>The claimant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is entitled to receive Medicare benefits if they have incurred the cost of a service provided to an eligible Medicare patient.</li>
		<li>
Must provide proof of identity. See information above 'Claimant unable to produce a Medicare card' and 'Claimant identification'</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Service Officer can search the Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) to see whether the claimant is already registered as a consumer.

<p>The correct policy for the signing of the MS014 is as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the form must be signed by the claimant</li>
		<li>
where the claimant cannot sign, an appointed <a href="../your-health/011-40030000-01.html">Power of Attorney, Guardianship, Administrative orders and Authorised Representative for Medicare</a> may sign on their behalf</li>

<h3>Power of Attorney, Guardianship, Administrative Orders and Authorised Representative for Medicare </h3>


<p>Where the claimant is unable to sign the MS014 form, an appointed Power of Attorney, Legal Guardian, Administrator or Authorised Representative for Medicare may sign on their behalf. These orders give an individual the legal authority to act on behalf of the claimant.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers need to ensure that the Power of Attorney, Guardianship Order, Administrative Order or Authorised Representative for Medicare provide authority for that individual to <a href="../your-health/011-40030000-01.html">claim a Medicare benefit on the claimant's behalf</a>.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3IG_Claimant_signature_d"></a>
<h3>Claimant signature differs from claimant details</h3>


<p>Where a claimant's signature is clearly legible and obviously does not correspond with the name of the claimant detailed on the claim form, for example, the claimant name is Mary Jones and the signature clearly reads Bob Smith, the claim must not be paid.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a claimant's signature does not need to be legible to be acceptable. Claimants can use any type of symbol as their signature, for example, X. Claims should only be returned where there is a difference in names.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>This information provides Service Officers with information on how to pay Medicare benefits to claimants when they are claiming at a service centre.</p>

<p>Claims can be lodged in a service centre via the staff assisted document lodgement (formerly known as the drop box) or as a face-to-face service. If claimants choose to lodge a claim via the staff assisted document lodgement, they will need to complete a Medicare claim form MS014 and attach to the original account/receipt being lodged for processing.</p>

<p>As a general rule, any persons 14 years and over can claim a Medicare benefit where they have incurred the cost for services provided to a Medicare eligible person.</p>

<p>When a claimant or any person 14 years and over and enrolled on the same Medicare card as the claimant acting on behalf of the claimant attends a service centre to claim for Medicare benefits, they are <strong>not</strong> required to fill in the Medicare Claim form (MS014), provided that the account is paid in full.</p>

<p>The claimant is always the person who incurred the medical expense for a service rendered. The claimant must sign the printed receipt when attending a service centre acknowledging that they have paid for the medical service rendered.</p>

<p>The claimant is required to produce their Medicare card and present either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the account and receipt</li>
		<li>
a combined account and receipt</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the claimant is not the patient, the claimant <strong>must</strong> either provide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the patient's Medicare card number if available</li>
		<li>
sufficient details to identify the patient</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers <strong>must ensure that the claimant details are correctly recorded</strong>. The customer at the counter may not necessarily be the claimant. Service Officers must ask the customer every time whether they are the claimant (incurred the expense).</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43010040-03.html">Process</a> page contains details on how to action an EFT claim lodged via face-to-face at a service centre.</p>

<h3>Medicare Easyclaim</h3>

<h3>Quality control</h3>


<p>If a Service Officer is being quality controlled and work is selected for quality control and the information on the MS014 form differs from the information on the <strong>QBBI</strong> screen, the quality control (QC) checker must access CDMS to ensure that the claim was paid using a card issue number issued in the last 12 months. The QC checker must not automatically record the transaction as an error.</p>

<p><strong>See also&#58;</strong> Quality control manuals for patient claims have been removed from the Medicare Portal. To locate the Quality Checking procedures, select the link to the Quality Framework page in the Quality Information Hub.</p>
