<p>If the payment has been made to an account the customer has legal access to (either solely or jointly) while it may not have been the customer's preferred account, the agency has met its payment delivery obligation. The customer would not be entitled to have the payment replaced. In some cases, customers may still be able to access an account that they consider to have closed.</p>

<p>Legal Access means that a customer is able to access the funds in this account by being considered a signatory to the account, that is, the account is in the customer's name whether singularly or jointly with someone else and the customer is legally able to withdraw funds. This does not mean where the customer has access to someone else's account because they have been given the access card and PIN number.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>DL </strong>screen for <strong>DOC</strong>s to show whether replacement payments have been requested in the past. Check the Debt List (<strong>OPDL</strong>) for debts with the reason code of ‘DUP’ or ‘DRA’.</p>

<p>Financial institutions can provide the customer with a notice of closure or no legal entitlement to account, which can aid in providing evidence of bank account access. The customer would be required to attend the financial institution with proof of identification to get this notice. <strong>This should only be requested, if there are concerns about the validity of the request or if the customer has a debt history due to requesting replacement payments.</strong></p>

<p>Does the customer have legal access to the account (the customer’s name would normally be in the account title), and can they withdraw the funds?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, tell the customer that as the payment has been made to an account they have legal access to they are not entitled to have the payment replaced. To change the payment destination for future payments, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04030010-01.html">Changing payment destination</a>. Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong>.

<p><strong>'Stop Payment'</strong> <strong>DOC</strong></p>

<p>Create a 'Stop Payment' <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record explaining why they are not entitled to the arrears payment. The ICT Service Desk needs this <strong>DOC </strong>for audit purposes.</p>

<p>It <strong>must </strong>include the following details&#58;</p>

payment type/component</li>
		<li>
amount to be removed/stopped</li>
		<li>
period of the payment to be removed/stopped</li>

the reason the stop payment is needed. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; recording 'customer not entitled' as the stop payment reason is not sufficient. The <strong>DOC</strong> must specify why the customer is not entitled</li>
