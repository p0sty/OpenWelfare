<p>Customers applying for independence who had periods of self-employment are required to supply evidence. This evidence must be sufficient to satisfy the Service Officer that the customer has worked an average of 30 hours per week for at least 18 months in a 2 year period.</p>

<p>Customers applying for independence who were employees, are required to supply appropriate evidence of their employment, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
letter(s) from employers which outline periods of employment and hours worked</li>
		<li>
payslips, payroll reports or payment summaries (group certificates) from their employer showing the weekly hours worked and periods of employment</li>
		<li>
Employment Separation Certificate may be accepted if it is supplied in conjunction with other forms of evidence as listed above</li>
		</ul>
<p>Documents such as Tax Notices of Assessment, which show an amount of income for a financial year, cannot be used to verify hours worked. Statements of service from the Australian Defence Force (not reserves), without hours per week are acceptable as it is not possible to do part-time military service.</p>

<p><strong>Service Officers</strong> assessing a claim for independence may obtain evidence through verbal contact with employer/s <strong>or</strong> a written letter from previous employer/s already in the customer's possession. Staff must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only discuss periods of employment</li>
		<li>
remain diligent in protecting the customer's privacy</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where there is reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of the evidence provided, additional evidence may be requested. For example, where the customer has provided a letter from the customer's family business stating the hours worked, payslips or a TNA could also be requested to support the claim.</p>

<p>Check the period of employment and the number of hours worked per week during any period of 2 years. The hours worked can be averaged over periods of up to 13 weeks. For example, the customer must have worked at least&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
30 hours each week</li>
		<li>
120 hours of work in each of 19 periods of 4 weeks, or</li>
		<li>
390 hours of work in each of 6 periods of 13 weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note&#58;</strong> 19 periods of 4 weeks is a total of 76 weeks only. Customers will <strong>also need</strong> to show they have worked <strong>at least</strong> 30 hours each week for an additional 2 weeks to meet 78 weeks in total.</p>

<p>The hours worked cannot be averaged over periods longer than 13 weeks. A letter from an employer that states the customer has worked (<strong>at least</strong>) 30 hours per week over an 18 month period can be accepted but a letter stating the young person has worked <strong>an</strong> <strong>average</strong> of 30 hours each week over an 18 month period cannot be accepted. Evidence is required of the hours worked per week so that the averaging can be assessed over periods of 13 weeks or less. Statements of service from the Australian Defence Force (not reserves) without hours per week are acceptable as it is not possible to do part-time military service.</p>

<p>Hours worked can include the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Periods of paid leave - annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, Pandemic Leave Disaster Payments (PLDP)</li>
		<li>
Periods of unpaid leave due to an employer shutdown, that is outside the control of the person. For example, mandatory Christmas leave</li>
		<li>
Periods of engagement in a full-time apprenticeship or other full-time training agreement</li>
		<li>
Periods of full-time employment participation in a Community Development and Employment Program</li>
		<li>
Periods of receiving workers' compensation and the customer can demonstrate they are still connected to their employment</li>
		<li>
Periods of full-time employment overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>For assistance in determining if the customer has worked an average of 30 hours per week for a period of at least 18 months during any period of 2 years, use the <a href="../job-seekers/001-04060040-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Independence_As">Independence Assessment Tool</a>.</p>

<p>Service Officers are able to view the customer's work history information and calculations completed by the system when processing a YA student online claim. No further evidence/ assessment is required in these cases.</p>

<p>Service Officers undertaking an Independence assessment for a current customer must check '<strong>DL</strong>' to establish if the customer has submitted a <strong>COC</strong> (Change of circumstance) activity through <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-08220010-01.html">Check Independence through work history</a> online tool.</p>

<p>Has the customer provided evidence to fully support they worked an average of 30 hours per week (i.e. full-time) for periods of at least 18 months in a 2 year period?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, the customer satisfies this criterion. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-04060040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_independ_Step01">Step 1 in Table 2</a></li>
		<li>

<p>This applies to YA customers who are at least 18 years of age, not living with or being supported by their parent(s), and who have an education or employment disadvantage. They may be assessed as independent if they have had employment of at least 30 hours per week for a 12 month period or periods totalling 12 months.</p>

<p>There are no questions about the special safety net criteria in the YA online claim or Claim for Youth Allowance (SY001), nor the Assisted Customer Claim. The claim details should be checked for the following information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer is at least 18 years of age</li>
		<li>
the customer is not living at the home of either or both parents</li>
		<li>
have had full-time employment of at least 30 hours per week for a period of at least 12 months, or for periods that total at least 12 months</li>
		<li>
the highest level of education that they have completed in Australia or overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Deciding if the customer is specially disadvantaged in terms of education or employment</strong></p>

<p>Specially disadvantaged refers to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>education&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
for a student - a person who has not completed Year 12 or the equivalent</li>
			<li>
for a job seeker - a person who has not completed Year 12 (or equivalent) or a Certificate III or higher</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>employment&#58;</strong> a person whose personal circumstances and labour market skills make it difficult for them to find a job. For example, a person who is classified as high risk on the Job Seeker Snapshot</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the decision that a customer is specially disadvantaged is not dependent on the activity the customer is undertaking. For example, a customer qualified as an Australian Apprentice could meet the criterion of specially disadvantaged with respect to education if they have not completed year 12 or equivalent.</p>

<p>For assistance in making this decision, see the <a href="../job-seekers/001-04060040-04.html">References</a> page for a link to details in the Guide on Education or Employment Disadvantage for YA.</p>

<p>To be assessed under this criterion, the customer must provide evidence with their claim to prove they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
were working for 30 hours per week in a 12 month period, or for periods totalling 12 months (for example, payslips), and</li>
		<li>
are not being financially supported (indirectly or directly) by their parent(s). This could be a statutory declaration or bank statements</li>
		</ul>
<p>Is the customer specially disadvantaged in terms of education or employment?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, the customer is independent. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this criterion is reviewable if the customer's circumstances change. For further information, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-07020010-01.html">Reviews of independence for Youth Allowance</a>. See<a href="../job-seekers/001-04060040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Coding_independ_Step01"> Step 1 in Table 2</a></li>
		<li>
