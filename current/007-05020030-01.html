<p>This procedure outlines the Paid Parental Leave scheme work test for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). The work test for PPL and DAP are very similar, the main difference is how the 13 month work test period is calculated.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>To be eligible for PPL in normal circumstances, primary and secondary claimants need to meet a work test.</p>

<p>To meet the work test a customer must have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work for a period spanning 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) within the 392 day work test period (approximately 13 months), and&#58;</li>
		<li>
had no more than a break of 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) between 2 qualifying work days in the 295 day (approximately 10 months) qualifying period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between workdays during the 392 day (about 13 months) work test period. They just cannot have this gap during their 295 day (about 10 months) qualifying period.</p>

<p>Customers may still be eligible for PPL if they have resigned or intend to resign from their employer. The PPL work test is based on the customer's employment information in the 392 day period prior to the birth/entry into care of their child.</p>

<p>If exceptional circumstances for PPL apply, secondary claimants may be exempt from the work test. PPL tertiary claimants are also exempt from the work test.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> JobKeeper Payment and COVID-19 Disaster Payments (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021) count towards the work test. Other COVID-19 payments, such as those paid by state or territory governments and Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, <strong>do not</strong> count as qualifying work for the work test.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>To be eligible for DAP all customers must meet the work test.</p>

<p>To meet the work test a customer must have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work for a period spanning 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) within the 392 day work test period (approximately 13 months), and</li>
		<li>
had no more than a break of 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) between 2 qualifying work days in the 295 day (approximately 10 months) qualifying period</li>

<p>Current or continuing employment is not a requirement of the work test. A customer may be currently unemployed or may be planning to resign from their employment at the time they lodge their claim, and can still meet the work test based on their employment during the qualifying period. The DAP work test is based on the customer's employment information in the 392 day period before the nominated DAP period start date.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the JobKeeper Payment and COVID-19 Disaster Payments (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021) count towards the work test. Other COVID-19 payments, such as those paid by state or territory governments and Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, do not count as qualifying work for the work test.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Qualifying_work">Qualifying work</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A customer is considered to have worked on a day when at least one hour of qualifying work has been performed on that day. Work performed (whether or not the work was performed in Australia) as an employee, contractor, self-employment, or any form of gainful activity for reward or financial gain is considered as qualifying work. A customer can count work performed during the work test period for multiple employers, such as a second or previous job.</p>

<p>Paid leave, such as recreational leave and sick leave, counts towards a claimant's qualifying work. A person is also taken to be on paid leave if they are on unpaid leave from their employer while receiving workers compensation, accident compensation or a similar payment.</p>

<p>Previous PPL and/or DAP periods in the 13 months before the birth or adoption of a second and subsequent child will count as 'qualifying work' towards the Paid Parental Leave scheme work test. If a customer includes a previous period of PPL and/or DAP in the work test, a weekday will count as 7.6 hours.</p>

<p>The JobKeeper Payment and COVID-19 Disaster Payments (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021) also count towards the work test. Customers who received JobKeeper Payment during their work test period for PPL or DAP can count 7.6 hours for each weekday (Monday - Friday) towards meeting the work test.</p>

<p>Customers who performed at least one hour of paid work or paid leave (including weekends) and received JobKeeper Payment can count whichever is greater&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
7.6 hours for each weekday in the period (not including weekends)</li>
		<li>
The number of hours actually worked each day (including weekends)</li>
		<li>
The number of hours of paid leave each day</li>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-05020030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains examples of the work test period and qualifying period.</p>

<p><strong>Premature birth</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
For a <strong>PPL customer</strong>, an exception to the work test may be applied if the customer is required to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
cease employment early, or</li>
			<li>
reduce their hours of employment because their child was delivered prematurely</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If a <strong>DAP customer</strong> was expected to meet the work test based on the nominated DAP period start date but did not meet the work test due to the child's premature birth&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
they are determined to have met the work test if, relevant evidence has been provided, and</li>
			<li>
it is clear they would have met the work test had the child not been born prematurely</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Pregnancy related complications or illness</strong></p>

<p>A customer may meet the work test if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the birth mother has experienced pregnancy related complications or illness that prevented them from working, and</li>
		<li>
the customer would have met the work test had the pregnancy related complications or illness not occurred, and</li>
		<li>
suitable evidence has been provided</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>No longer employed</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is no longer employed, for example, business has ceased trading or their work contract has ceased, the customer may still be deemed to meet the work test.</p>

<p>A Service Officer must be satisfied that the medical condition prevented the customer from seeking new employment or extending their contract. To support this, evidence of a consistent work history showing a strong connection to the workforce must be provided.</p>

<p><strong>Special Circumstances</strong></p>

<p>For PPL and DAP claims made on or after 4 September 2021, customers who do not meet the work test may qualify for an exception if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
experienced special circumstances within their work test period, and</li>
		<li>
this affected their ability to perform paid work</li>
		</ul>
<p>An exception to the work test may be applied if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
special circumstances existed, and</li>
		<li>
the customer would have met the work test if the special circumstances did not exist</li>
		</ul>
<p>The special circumstance exception reasons include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
severe medical condition or caring for a close family member who is affected by a severe medical condition</li>
		<li>
natural disaster declared by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory, and</li>
		<li>
family and domestic violence</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Severe medical condition</strong></p>

<p>A PPL or DAP customer may meet the work test if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they were prevented from working during their work test period because they were&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
affected by a severe medical condition, or</li>
			<li>
caring for a close family member who was affected by a severe medical condition</li>		</ul>
		<li>
suitable evidence has been provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>A close family member is the customer's&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
partner</li>
		<li>
child (natural, adopted or step-child)</li>
		<li>
sibling (natural, adopted or step-sibling)</li>
		<li>
parent (natural, adopted or step-parent)</li>
		<li>
partner's parent (natural, adopted or step-parent)</li>
		<li>
a person the customer has legal guardianship over</li>
		</ul>
<p>For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 'family member' includes cultural kinship relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Natural disaster</strong></p>

<p>A PPL or DAP customer may meet the work test if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they were prevented from working during their work test period because they were severely affected by a natural disaster</li>
		<li>
the natural disaster has been declared by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory (see the <a href="../families/007-05020030-05.html">Resources</a> page)</li>
		<li>
suitable evidence has been provided</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> COVID-19 is <strong>not</strong> considered a natural disaster for the work test as it has not been declared a natural disaster by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory. A more targeted approach was implemented to support customers affected by COVID-19. These include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the extended work test measure (for children born or adopted between 22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021), and</li>
		<li>
counting JobKeeper Payment and the COVID-19 Disaster Payment as qualifying work</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Family and domestic violence</strong></p>

<p>A PPL or DAP customer may meet the work test if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they were prevented from working during their work test period because they&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
experienced family and domestic violence, or</li>
			<li>
were dealing with the impacts of family and domestic violence</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the circumstances have been assessed by a social worker</li>
		<li>
suitable evidence has been provided</li>

the social worker may assist the customer with evidence for their circumstances, but the customer must still provide evidence of their employment</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Dangerous_Jobs_">Dangerous Jobs Provision</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Dangerous Job provision applies to pregnant customers/birth mothers who stop work due to a hazard in their workplace that was or is a risk to their pregnancy.</p>

<p>There are a few recognised professions where it can be confirmed that a particular job is dangerous to pregnant women. Currently these include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
boxers</li>
		<li>
jockeys, and</li>
		<li>
mining contractors</li>
		</ul>
<p>While the intent for this provision was aimed at these particular industries, the provision does not explicitly preclude other professions. Depending on the claimant's individual work circumstances, there may be a condition of the customer's work that constitutes a hazard connected to the work performed.</p>

<p>Customers will still need to meet the work test but can use the day they stopped work as the last day of their work test period.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a customer may be assessed under the Dangerous Job provision if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cease work due to the risk that coronavirus (COVID-19) has on their pregnancy, or</li>
		<li>
are unable to be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to a risk to the pregnancy</li>
		</div>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>PPL and DAP customers who do not meet the work test due to COVID-19, may be able to extend their work test period.</p>

<p>The extended work test will apply to customers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not meet the existing PPL scheme work test because they stopped work, or had their work hours reduced, due to <strong>COVID-19</strong>, and</li>
		<li>
have a child with a date of birth or adoption between <strong>22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>PPL Extended Work Test</strong></p>

<p>Customers who stopped work or had their hours reduced <strong>due to COVID-19</strong>, may extend their PPL work test period if they <strong>do not</strong> meet any of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the existing PPL work test in the 392 days (about 13 months) before the child's expected/actual date of birth or adoption</li>
		<li>
the premature birth or pregnancy related illness/complication exceptions, or</li>
		<li>
the dangerous job provision</li>
		</ul>
<p>In addition, the customer's child must have a date of birth or adoption between <strong>22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The PPL extended work test period is the <strong>600 days</strong> (about <strong>20 months</strong>) before the child's expected/actual date of birth or adoption. To meet the extended work test, the customer must meet the following <strong>within the extended work test period</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work within the 295 day qualifying period (about 10 months)</li>
		<li>
not had a continuous gap longer than 12 weeks between consecutive working days during that 295 day period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between workdays during the 392 day (about 13 months) work test period. They just cannot have this gap during their 295 day (about 10 months) qualifying period.</p>

<p>Primary claimants who meet the PPL extended work test, can nominate a PPL period start date that is on or after their child's date of birth/adoption. They can do this even if they lodge their claim and provide proof of birth more than 28 days after the child's birth or adoption. If the customer nominates a start date in the past and they or their partner are receiving an income support payment or Family Tax Benefit (FTB) during the backdated PPL period, they must be advised of potential overpayments to these payments. See <a href="../families/007-07030070-01.html">Determining a customer's Paid Parental Leave (PPL) period start date</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the usual backdating provisions apply for customers who meet the existing PPL scheme work test.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 affected PPL customers who have returned to work</strong></p>

<p>Customers who meet the PPL extended work test can claim PPL after they have returned to work and still be eligible for the PPL period. Their PPL period can be paid up to the date they returned to work. See <a href="../families/007-05040040-01.html">Parental Leave Pay (PPL) customer returns to work</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DAP Extended Work Test</strong></p>

<p>Customers who stopped work or had their hours reduced <strong>due to COVID-19</strong>, may extend their DAP work test period if they <strong>do not</strong> meet either of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the existing DAP work test in the 392 days (about 13 months) before their DAP nominated start date, or</li>
		<li>
the premature birth exception</li>
		</ul>
<p>In addition, the customer's child must have a date of birth or adoption between <strong>22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The DAP extended work test period is the <strong>600</strong> days (about <strong>20 months</strong>) before the DAP nominated start date. To meet the extended work test, the customer must meet the following within the <strong>extended work test period</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work within the 295 day qualifying period (about 10 months), and</li>
		<li>
not had a continuous gap longer than 12 weeks between consecutive working days during that 295 day period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between workdays during the 392 day (about 13 months) work test period. They just cannot have this gap during their 295 day (about 10 months) qualifying period.</p>
