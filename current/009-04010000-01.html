<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Initial_contact">Initial contact</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A correspondence nominee can submit a claim for CP and/or CA on behalf of the carer, however, only nominee individuals can submit a <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> claim online for CP and/or CA. Nominee organisations cannot lodge a claim for CP and/or CA online.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> lodgement of a Medical Report on its own is not considered a claim for CP and/or CA.</p>

<p>If a carer or their correspondence nominee contacts to claim CP and/or CA, an <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" />online claim must be offered first. Service Officers can explain the benefits of claiming online such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
help to apply for the right payment through streaming questions and early warnings if they may not be eligible</li>
		<li>
less information for them to provide, as information from their Centrelink record will be pre-populated into the online claim</li>
		<li>
they can monitor the progress of their claim through their Centrelink online account</li>
		<li>
carer's can also use the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to monitor their claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the carer or their correspondence nominee declines the online claim offer, a Service Officer can use Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) to collect claim information from a carer or their correspondence nominee either over the phone or face-to-face.</p>

<p>When ACC is completed, tell the carer or their nominee of any outstanding documents they must provide, or action they have to take to submit their claim. Carers can submit the documents via their online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.</p>

<p>If ACC is used to submit a claim, a Service Officer must ask the carer or their nominee to accept a verbal declaration. A Customer Declaration Form (CDF) must be sent to the carer or their correspondence nominee for their signature if they are unable or decline to make a verbal declaration.</p>

<p>The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03010000-01.html">First Contact Service Offer (FCSO) workflow</a> can only be used in limited circumstances when it has been determined this is the only method available to suit the carer's or nominee's needs. FCSO can issue CP and/or CA new claim forms for both adult and child care receivers. A CA adjusted taxable income details form (SA489) will always be issued with a CA or combined CP and CA claim without checking if the carer is <a href="../carers/009-18091105-01.html">exempt from providing their income details for the CA income test</a> or if existing income details can be reused.</p>

from the <strong>Make a claim</strong> page select <strong>Get Started </strong>under the <strong>Carers</strong> category</li>
		<li>
answer the streaming questions on the <strong>Check your Eligibility</strong> page to check their eligibility for CP and/or CA. If the carer will not be eligible for CP and/or CA based on the answers to the streaming questions, the online claim will advise why they may not be eligible and refer them to the <strong>Payment and Service Finder</strong> or advise them to contact Services Australia to discuss a more suitable payment.

<p>A Medical Report from a Treating Health Professional (THP) is not considered a claim for CP and/or CA. Where a carer submits an online claim, Assisted Customer Claim or lodges a paper claim for 1 payment only, for example, the carer is claiming CA only and the Medical Report indicates it is a claim for CP and CA, only a claim for CA is to be assessed.</p>

<p>However, the carer must be given an opportunity to lodge or complete a claim for the other payment. If the carer lodges a claim for CP and is eligible for both CP and CA, determine if 'special circumstances' are applicable to the start date.</p>

<p>If a <strong>new</strong> medical report has been provided following the rejection of the CP and/or CA claim not meeting the Adult Disability Assessment Tool (ADAT) or the Disability Care Load Assessment (child) Determination (DCLAD) qualifying scores, do not adjust the existing CNA/Treating Health Professional (THP) scores on the carer/care receiver’s record. A new line must be created and new medical responses added.</p>

<p>This could occur in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
original claim has been rejected Failed to Reply to Correspondence (FRC) and a new medical report has been provided</li>
		<li>
original claim has been rejected due to THP score and a new medical report has been provided</li>
		<li>
original adult claim has been rejected due to combined ADAT score and a new medical report has been provided</li>
		<li>
original child claim has been rejected due to Insufficient Care Load and a new medical report has been provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the carer provides additional information during a phone conversation, it must be recorded to ensure the carer's record reflects their most recent circumstances. As the information provided is to reassess the rejection, it is not referred to an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) unless the carer clearly indicates they want to apply for a formal review of the decision.</p>

<p>If <strong>new</strong> medical information is obtained via a verbal conversation with a THP, Service Officers may adjust the existing information by changing the confirmed line of medical information and documenting this on the carer's record.</p>

<p>If a CP and/or CA claim has been previously rejected and the carer submits a new medical report or CNA <strong>within 13 weeks</strong> of the rejection and the claim can be reopened, the existing medical report or CNA that resulted in the initial rejection of the CP and/or CA claim must <strong>not</strong> be amended or deleted. A new line must be created and the new medical report and/or CNA responses added.</p>

<p>The <a href="../carers/009-04010000-03.html">Process</a> page explains how to code medical information for a reassessment of a rejected claim.</p>
