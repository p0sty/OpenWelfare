<p>DAP is paid under the Paid Parental Leave scheme for a child born or adopted before 1 July 2023. The payment is for eligible working fathers or other partners (including adopting parents) who are caring for a child. DAP is paid at the rate of the national minimum wage for a maximum of 2 weeks (in a lump sum).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> DAP claims lodged by birth mothers on behalf of their partners will be <a href="../families/007-05020050-01.html">made not effective (NEF)</a> as birth mothers are not an eligible person to claim DAP.</p>

<p>DAP can only be paid for 1 child of a multiple birth. Where the customer has already received DAP for 1 of the children from the multiple birth the DAP claim for the subsequent child in most cases should be rejected.</p>

<p>In the rare event there is a significant delay between the births of the children it may be possible for DAP to be paid for more than 1 child. Service Officers <strong>must</strong> refer these cases to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk with all relevant evidence for investigation. </p>

<p>Was there a significant delay between the birth of the first and subsequent child/ren from the same pregnancy?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, DAP may be payable for more than 1 child from a multiple pregnancy if there was a significant delay between the births. Customers <strong>must</strong> provide additional evidence to support their claims before the claim for the subsequent child can be assessed.<br>A letter from the hospital or midwife where the children were delivered confirming the children were born during separate birthing events and not as part of a multiple birth <strong>must</strong> be provided. See <a href="../families/007-05020010-03.html">Processing Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) claims</a> to code exemption</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, DAP can only be paid to 1 child of the multiple birth. If the customer has already received DAP for a child from the same multiple birth they cannot claim for the subsequent child. See <a href="../families/007-05020010-01.html">Processing Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) claims</a></li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> multiple births being treated as separate birthing events does not apply to Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and does not impact on the rates of Newborn Supplement (NBS), Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) and Multiple Birth Allowance (MBA).</p>

<p>To be eligible for DAP, the customer must have care of a child for DAP purposes for <strong>each day</strong> in the DAP period.</p>

<p>One or more people may be caring for the same child on a particular day. The customer may be the primary carer of the child or providing care for the child at the same time as another person (for example, the child's birth mother) who is providing primary care for the child.</p>

<p>A customer may still be eligible for DAP if they are not caring for the child for all or part of the DAP period if all of the below are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the child was not returned to the person's care without the customers consent</li>

<p>Receiving paid leave or working during a DAP period does not affect DAP eligibility in the event of a stillborn or infant death.</p>

<p>The introduction of the ‘Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits)’ meant customers could not receive JobKeeper Payment and DAP for the same period. There were no changes to the DAP rules regarding work or paid leave for bereavement cases.</p>

<p>DAP bereavement claims are processed by the Smart Centres Families Bereavement and DOP Team (DOP region code). See <a href="../families/007-04050010-01.html">Death of a family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme child</a>.</p>

<p>From 12 March 2020, return to work rules were updated to include an additional exception for health professionals, emergency services or essential workers who work during the DAP period in response to a state, territory or national emergency (including COVID-19).</p>

<p>A person is an essential worker if the person has specific skills, or is involved in the production of goods or the delivery of services, where the skills, goods or services are essential in responding to an emergency.</p>

<p>Customers working during the DAP period can continue to receive DAP if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are a health professional, emergency services worker or an essential worker, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
are working during a declared state, territory or national emergency, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
are working in response to an emergency, either voluntarily or recalled by their employer</li>
		</ul>
<p>To determine if the customer meets the exception, ask the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when they worked to ensure it was during the emergency period </li>
		<li>
are they a health professional, emergency services or essential worker</li>
		<li>
did they return to work in <strong>response to</strong> an emergency </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer was scheduled to work during their DAP period anyway, they do not meet the exception. Only customers who work <strong>in response to</strong> an emergency are covered by this exception.</p>

<p>It is <strong>not</strong> a requirement that customers provide evidence. However, in limited circumstances Service Officers can request evidence if they are not satisfied that the customer meets the requirements for this exception reason. Evidence can include a letter from their employer stating the customer returned to work because they are an essential worker responding to a state, territory or national emergency.</p>

If the customer advises they worked for a permissible purpose, Service Officers need to create a manual <strong>DOC</strong> detailing the permissible work discussion, but are not required to record work details.</p>

<p>A self-employed customer who is actively engaged in running or maintaining the daily operations of the business during their DAP period would be regarded as working.</p>

<p>DAP customers have the option of moving their DAP period, see <a href="../families/007-05040030-01.html">Change of circumstances for Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</a>. Updates to work details are made by using the <strong>DAP Work Details </strong>guided procedure.</p>

		<li>
verification of the adoption or surrogacy arrangement</li>
		</ul>
<p>In cases where one parent, such as the birth mother, is not claiming family assistance or Paid Parental Leave at the time proof of birth is lodged, the following procedure applies&#58;</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> <strong>Post birth DAP claim&#58;</strong> advise the customer to complete an online claim, and provide the 'Doctor/Midwife Proof of Birth Declaration' (back page of the FA081). If the DAP customer is unable to provide the 'Doctor/Midwife Proof of Birth Declaration', other acceptable proof of birth needs to be supplied. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> confirmation the customer has registered or has applied to register the child’s birth with the relevant state or territory registry of births must be obtained</p>

<p><strong>Finalising a pre-birth DAP claim&#58;</strong> proof of birth is required to finalise the pre-birth claim. Advise the customer to provide the fully completed FA081. Customers can upload the completed FA081 via <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload documents</a>. If Upload documents is not available, the customer can provide the document by post or in person at a service centre. If the DAP customer is unable to lodge the FA081, <a href="../families/007-03010030-01.html">other acceptable proof of birth needs to be provided</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the child’s actual date of birth or adoption is <strong>on or after 1 July 2023</strong>, the DAP claim will be rejected once proof of birth/entry to care is provided. The rejection letter will invite the customer to claim PPL.</p>

<p>If the person lodging proof of birth is a biological parent of the child, they must have registered or applied to register the child's birth as required by the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry to meet the birth verification requirement for the child. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers advising they ‘intend’ to register the birth of their child with the relevant state or territory registry of births do not meet the birth verification requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if the customer is claiming DAP for more than 1 child from the same pregnancy (for example, twins) due to a significant delay between the births of each child, for example 5 days between birthing events, advise the customer they must provide a letter from the doctor/midwife who attended the births confirming the children were of the same pregnancy but born in separate birthing events.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>must</strong> refer these cases to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk. The referral must include a letter from the attending doctor/midwife who confirming the children were of the same pregnancy but born in separate birthing events.</p>

<p>In the case of child bereavement where the child is stillborn or dies, the Claim for Bereavement Payment form (FA008) including a completed proof of birth page can be used for verification of birth for DAP purposes.</p>

<p>Where the child is part of an adoption or surrogacy arrangement the customer will be required to provide evidence of the surrogacy arrangement or adoption.</p>

<p><strong>Work, income and residency</strong></p>

<p>Advise the customer they may also need to provide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
