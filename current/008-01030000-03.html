<p>Epilepsy is a long-term brain condition where a person has repeated seizures. These are episodes of disrupted electrical activity in the brain and can vary greatly depending on the part of the brain involved. Epilepsy is not one single condition. There are a range of different conditions that can cause seizures. Seizures usually last 1 to 3 minutes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Seizures can cause symptoms such as&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
a loss of consciousness, </li>
		<li>
unusual jerking movements (convulsions) as well as </li>
		<li>
other unusual feelings, sensations and behaviours</li>

<p>There are varying degrees of hearing loss and speech disability. </p>

<p><strong>Hearing loss</strong> can be complete or partial. The age of the person at the onset of hearing loss can also affect the person’s ability to hear and speak.</p>

<p>People who do not have hearing loss often use the term ‘deaf’. It is more appropriate to use the term deaf for people who are born deaf or became deaf prior to language acquisition and whose preferred method of communication is sign language.</p>

<p><strong>Speech disability</strong> can develop in adults gradually, but they can also develop suddenly, such as in the case of stroke or medical procedure. Disorders can include the loss of ability to express or understand language, problems making certain sounds or words (for example, slurring) and changes to the rhythm or speed of speech.</p>

<p>People affected with speech disability are more likely to have mental illness, learning difficulties, behavioural disorders or may be socially isolate.</p>

<p><strong>Tinnitus</strong> is where the person hears a sound, a ringing, or a noise when no external noise is present. The noise can be intermittent or constant, mild or severe and may vary from a low roar to a high-pitched sound.</p>

<p><strong>Noise induced hearing loss</strong> (sensorineural hearing loss) usually develops over a period of years, although it can occur more rapidly following exposure to a loud noise. A noise which is regular and of a continuing frequency or pitch level can result in this kind of hearing loss.</p>

<p><strong>Meniere’s disease</strong> is progressive disease of the inner ear in which the first symptom is usually vertigo (dizziness). Over time tinnitus and hearing loss can develop.</p>

<p><strong>Presbycusis</strong> is a progressive, high frequency hearing loss that is associated with increasing age. It can be complicated not only by a decrease of the nerve cells in the inner ear available for transmission of auditory signals, but also the additional loss of hearing receptors in the brain in which results in poorer speech discrimination than might be expected from the degree of hearing loss.</p>

<p><strong>Outer/middle ear infections</strong> may be caused by the build-up of wax in the outer ear cancel, which can lead to a reduction in hearing acuity. Medical treatment to remove the wax is usually all that is required. Middle ear infections can lead to permanent damage if not treated. These are common in young children. Chronic ear infection may result in ‘glue ear’, which affects the ability of the tiny bones of the middle ear to transmit sound to the inner ear.</p>

<p>The age at onset of hearing loss has significant implications for a person. A hearing loss is described as either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
prelingual (no exposure to oral language). Prelingual deafness or hearing loss may be present before birth or before language is developed, or</li>
		<li>
acquired (some exposure to oral language)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Hearing loss can also be acquired postlingually (after language has developed). However, the important difference between prelingual deafness and an acquired hearing loss is that the person has had exposure to the spoken language and, therefore, has had an opportunity to develop an appreciation of the sound and structure of language.</p>

<p>A hearing aid is a device used to improve hearing that a person wears in or behind the ear. The type of hearing aid a person has will be dependent on their lifestyle and situation.</p>

<p>A cochlear implant is an implanted electronic hearing device. It works by electronically stimulating the nerves inside the inner ear. This is different to a hearing aid.</p>

<strong>Lip reading and speech reading</strong> is a skill of understanding speech by interpreting the shape of the lips and the visual movements of the muscles involved in speech production. Speech reading is the ability to understand the intent of a speaker by watching the movements of the face and body by using information and language used by the situation</li>
		<li>
<strong>Manual communication</strong> refers to communication which is achieved by the use of the hands rather than verbal communication</li>
		<li>
<strong>Finger spelling</strong> (not to be confused with sign language). In finger spelling, signs represent letters of the alphabet. The person writes in the air using their finger, spelling words out letter by letter. In Australia finger spelling is used more extensively by older members of the community</li>
		<li>
<strong>Mime</strong> is a way using gestures and bodily movement, without speech or sound, to act out something</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gesture</strong> is movement of the body and especially the hands and arms which express an idea, emotion or attitude</li>
		<li>
<strong>Signs</strong> is the most commonly series of movements used by people who are deaf</li>
		<li>
<strong>Sign language.</strong> The native sign language of Australia is Auslan. To increase the person’s exposure to English, various methods have been devised for sign language. Some people will use just the 26 hand configurations to represent the letters of the alphabet while others use a combination of signs and finger spelling</li>
		<li>
<strong>Writing </strong>is a common form of communication that can be used either via a device or pen and paper</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>When speaking</strong> to a person with hearing loss or speech disability&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
get the person’s attention before starting a conversation</li>
		<li>
make sure the person can see your face without any obstructions. For example, do not cover your mouth while speaking. Many people use lip reading to help understand what is being said</li>
		<li>
reduce any background noise or try to find a quieter place to have a conversation</li>
		<li>
do not shout or speak loudly to the person unless requested, as this can be confusing and uncomfortable for a person wearing a hearing aid</li>
		<li>
speak clearly and slowly but do not exaggerate mouth movements</li>
		<li>
use natural gestures and facial expression to enhance the meaning of the discussion and to keep the listener interested</li>
		<li>
look directly at the person. This is so the person is able to lip-read. Do not move around whilst talking to a person who is trying to lip-read</li>
		<li>
use short and straightforward sentences and repeat or rephrase sentences if the person misunderstands. If words need to be used that a person may not understand, write them down and explain to the person what it means</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>When listening</strong> to a person who is deaf or has a hearing loss or speech disability&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
encourage the speaker to use their preferred method of communication</li>
		<li>
listen carefully to what the speaker says/signs</li>
		<li>
pay attention to the speaker’s facial expressions and gestures to gain extra information about what is being conveyed</li>
		<li>
ask for information to be repeated if it is not understood and always encourage the speaker to continue the conversation even if it is difficult to understand each other</li>
		<li>
always double check information to make sure the message is understood </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Writing information</strong> for a person who is deaf or has a hearing loss or speech disability is extremely useful but remember&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the most important information needs to be written first and only introduce one idea at a time</li>
		<li>
write ideas down as they are discussed or as they occur</li>
		<li>
write details about time, place and person at the beginning of a sentence wherever possible and do not use unnecessary words</li>
		<li>
only use words that are common and understood by most people and always break long sentences into short and concise sentences</li>
		<li>
if jargon or a technical term is required, explain the words and make sure that they are understood</li>		</ul>

<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus which harms the immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) occurs when the immune system has been permanently damaged by HIV and is no longer effective at protecting the body.</p>

<p>HIV and AIDS are not the same. HIV is the virus that leads to AIDS. Not everyone who has HIV will develop AIDS.</p>

<p>In the early 1980’s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began, patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today, there are many effective medicines to fight the infection, and people with HIV have longer, healthier lives.</p>

<p>These medicines help people with HIV, but do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Prenatal causes</strong></p>

<p>The cause is considered to have occurred prior to birth but the actual cause may not be known. Some causes of intellectual disabilities at the prenatal stage are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
chromosomal disorders</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Down Syndrome (trisomy 21) occurs when a person has an extra chromosome</li>
			<li>
Klinefelter’s Syndrome (XXY Syndrome) occurs when a male has an extra ‘X’ chromosome</li>		</ul>
		<li>
inborn errors of metabolism - where the body cannot absorb and/or process chemical substances naturally present in the food and necessary for the health of the body and brain. For example, if the thyroid gland is absent or is only partially functioning at birth</li>
		<li>
developmental disorders of brain formation – these abnormalities that occur in the development of a person’s brain prior to birth, e.g. incomplete closure of the neural tube which results in anencephaly and the condition where the size of the person’s head is significantly affected (hydrocephaly or microcephaly)</li>
		<li>
environmental influences</li>
			<ul>			<li>
maternal malnutrition</li>
			<li>
the effects of drugs or alcohol</li>
			<li>
some maternal diseases</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Perinatal causes</strong></p>

<p>Some perinatal causes of intellectual disability include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
intrauterine disorders – these are conditions within the uterus such as toxaemia, complications of labour or multiple births</li>
		<li>

<p>Intellectual disabilities can also occur after birth. For example, in early childhood due to diseases and/or environmental factors. Some postnatal causes of intellectual disability include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
infections. For example, encephalitis and meningitis</li>
		<li>
demyelinating disorders</li>
		<li>
degenerative disorders which affects intellectual and often physical functions over a period of time</li>
		<li>
seizure disorders</li>
		<li>
toxic-metabolic disorders</li>
		<li>
accidents resulting in oxygen deprivation. For example, near drowning</li>
		<li>
head injuries</li>
		<li>
malnutrition - the inadequate dietary intake of essential nutrition</li>
		<li>
environmental deprivation includes disabilities due to psycho-social disadvantage such as poverty, child abuse, neglect and social deprivation</li>		</ul>

<p>Customers with psychiatric and psychological conditions may suffer from episodes of being unwell in between periods of good health and functioning, while others may be continually unwell.</p>

<p><strong>Types of psychiatric and psychological conditions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Depression </strong>is a common mental health condition which can sometimes be associated with other medical conditions. The symptoms include changes in emotion/mood, impaired cognitive functioning, reduced motivation and changes in physical functioning such as weight loss/gain, reduced energy levels and sleep disturbance. Some people can feel suicidal.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety disorder </strong>may be associated with panic attacks. A panic attack characterised by sudden onset of intense fear accompanied by symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, trembling and feelings of unreality. The intensity of the attack can vary.</p>

<p><strong>Phobias</strong> are an excessive or unreasonable fear of certain objects or situations. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in a situation from which it would be difficult to escape or where help might not be readily available.</p>

<p><strong>Obsessive compulsive disorder</strong> involves repeated, intrusive thoughts or compulsive behaviours which are usually known to be irrational. Obsessions may focus on a fear of harming others, acquiring or spreading contamination, doubt about having performed a task. Compulsions can involve rituals of cleaning, repeating, checking, hoarding or avoiding.</p>

<p><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong> is a severe reaction to a traumatic event often involving actual or threatened death or serious injury to themselves or others. Post-traumatic stress disorder occurs where a person experiences persistent and intrusive recollections or dreams about the event. They often try to avoid situations that are associated with the trauma.</p>

<p><strong>Bipolar affective disorder</strong> is a mood disorder characterised by a person experiencing both episodes of depression and extreme elation or mania. During a manic phase, a person is often highly excited, over-active, over-confident, over-talkative and may lose touch with reality. In the depressed phase, a person can become sad, pessimistic about the future, withdrawn, underactive or have feelings of guilt. In either mood, people may experience hallucinations/delusions, sleep disturbance, frequent tearfulness, loss of concentration, a short attention span, confused thinking, and mood swings from a general hyperactive state to a flattened mood.</p>

<p><strong>Schizophrenia </strong>is characterised by social withdrawal, reduced emotional expressiveness and perceptual distortions. A misconception about schizophrenia is that the person has a split personality. The cause of schizophrenia is unknown and it has many varied symptoms, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
delusions</li>
		<li>
hallucinations – auditory and visual</li>
		<li>
disordered thinking and attention</li>
		<li>
bizarre behaviour</li>
		<li>
emotional withdrawal</li>
		<li>
loss of motivation</li>
		</ul>
<p>An acute schizophrenic episode is characterised by such things as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
alterations in the senses. For example, hearing voices</li>
		<li>
changes in emotional responsiveness</li>
		<li>
changes in behaviour such as neglect of personal health care, hygiene and presentation</li>
		<li>
having an altered sense of self and others e.g. may have unrealistic ideas about their own importance or unreasonable fears that others are trying to influence or harm them in some way</li>
		<li>
having impaired concentration and cognitive functioning resulting in an inability to respond appropriately</li>		</ul>

<p>Most causes of spinal cord injury (SCI) are traumatic. For example, motor vehicle accidents, falls, water sports and crash injuries. Non-traumatic causes are less common and include infections and tumours.</p>

<p>The types of SCI are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>complete injury</strong> – this is the loss of all movement and sensation below the level of the SCI</li>
		<li>
<strong>incomplete injury</strong> – there may be some sensation or muscle movement below the level of injury</li>
		<li>
<strong>quadriplegia</strong> – injury is at the level of the cervical (neck) cord segments. Quadriplegia means paralysis or weakness in all four limbs and trunk</li>
		<li>
<strong>paraplegia</strong> – the level of injury is below the cervical (neck) cord segments. Paraplegia means paralysis or weakness in the legs and sometimes the trunk (depending on the level of injury)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Paraplegia or quadriplegia can be complete or incomplete. Not all people in wheelchairs have an SCI and not all people with an SCI use wheelchairs.</p>

Cataracts are a clouding of the lenses within the eyes, which is normally clear and transparent</li>
		<li>
Diabetic retinopathy is directly related to diabetes mellitus and involves the retina and can include haemorrhage, swelling, detachment and growth of new blood vessels which leads to the progressive blurring of vision</li>
		<li>
Glaucoma involves a rise in the level of pressure within the eye which leads to damage of the optic nerve. This in turn can result in the loss of peripheral (side) vision and, unless detected early, can lead to blindness</li>
		<li>
Cone dystrophy results in the damage or breakdown of cone cells in the macula (this is the small central spot on the retina responsible for detailed vision). This condition does not result in total blindness, as peripheral vision remains intact</li>
		<li>
Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited degenerative condition which affect the retina. It particularly affects the rods which are the receptors in the retina responsible for night vision and detecting movement in the peripheral vision</li>

Hemianopia is caused by a Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) which is more commonly known as a stroke. The condition can vary in severity and may be temporary or permanent</li>		</ul>
