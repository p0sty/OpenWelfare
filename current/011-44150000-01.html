<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Medicare eligibility is based on Australian residency. Under Section 3 (1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, a person must meet one of the following requirements in order to be eligible for enrolment in Medicare as an Australian resident and receive a Medicare card&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An Australian citizen who resides in Australia</li>
		<li>
A New Zealand citizen who resides in Australia</li>
		<li>
A person with permanent residency status who resides in Australia (including return residents)</li>
		<li>
An applicant for permanent residency status who resides in Australia (exclusions apply)</li>
		<li>
Covered by a Ministerial order; or</li>
		<li>
A resident return visa holder</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Medicare card gives access to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a range of medical services</li>
		<li>
lower cost prescriptions</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Medicare_Card_n">Medicare Card numbers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Medicare cards display a 10 digit number, the last digit indicates the card issue number. The card issue number goes up sequentially to 9 then reverts to 1.</p>

<p>Up to 9 people can be listed on a card number with a maximum of 5 people on the first card and 4 people on a second card. Where there are more than 5 consumers associated with the same Medicare card number, the remaining 4 names are embossed on a second Medicare card with the same Medicare card number as the first card.</p>

<p>When registering a person in CDMS and the error message ‘00685 Maximum Individual Reference Number (IRN) on card’ appears, additional group members cannot be added as the Medicare card limit of 9 active IRNs has been reached.</p>

<p>CDMS allows for up to 12 members to be associated with a Medicare card but only a maximum of 9 active members, and 3 non-active members. This means that a card can have an IRN of 10-12, if certain members (in the range of IRN 1-9) have previously ended their association with the Medicare card.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where more than one consumer is to be associated with the same Medicare card number, the system shall ensure that each consumer has the same Medicare entitlement type with the exception of consumers who have the following Medicare entitlement types&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A - Australian Citizen</li>
		<li>
E - Migrant</li>
		<li>
ENZ - New Zealand Citizen</li>
		</ul>
<p>Consumers who have Medicare entitlement types of 'A' or 'E' or ‘ENZ’ can be associated with the same Medicare card number.</p>

<p>Where the consumer's entitlement type is not one allowed in association with the entitlement types of the other members on the Medicare card, the consumer must be transferred to a new Medicare card.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The CDMS does not allow a Medicare card (new or duplicate) to be produced or a Medicare enrolment to be updated where there is an inconsistency with the entitlement type. When an entitlement type is changed from one status to another, for example, 'applicant for permanent resident status'(P) or (Z) to 'permanent resident status (E)', the Service Officer must request a new Medicare card. If only one person is changing their entitlement type, they must be transferred off the card onto a card of their own.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Each individual enrolled on a card is allocated an Individual Reference Number (IRN) from 1 to 9. This number is against each person listed on the Medicare card.</p>

<p>By combining the Medicare card number with the person’s IRN number on the card, each person on the card can be uniquely identified. The names of the consumers shall be embossed on the physical Medicare card in ascending order of their card reference number.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>When a person first enrols in Medicare, they are allocated a Personal Identification Number (PIN). As a person's Medicare card number may change if they are transferred or copied to a different card, the Personal Identification Number (PIN) is used to link the person to all card numbers to maintain claims history.

<p>A person is registered for Medicare using the CDMS. A Medicare card is issued depending on the entitlement type of the person. There are 3 types of Medicare cards&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Standard Medicare (green) card&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Issued to a person who is an Australian citizen, New Zealand citizen, Migrant or Diplomat who is residing in Australia</li>
		<li>
All standard Medicare cards (including new enrolments, automatic re-issued cards and operator re-issued cards) are issued for a period of between 5 and 7 years</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Interim (blue) cards&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Issued to people who are applicants for permanent resident status</li>
		<li>
Ministerial Orders</li>
		<li>
All interim cards (including new enrolments, re-issued Medicare cards) are issued in accordance with the policy and procedures that surround these enrolment types</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>RHCA (yellow)&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>A Medicare card is posted to the group contact and usually takes 3-4 weeks.</p>

<p>Customers can add their Medicare card(s) to the wallet in their myGov app. The Digital Medicare card in the myGov app has protections against fraud and theft including a myGov hologram, QR code and time stamp.</p>

<p>The digital Medicare card is a verifiable credential. This means that customers can use it to prove their identity and to access Medicare services.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-19061438-01.html">Using myGov accounts</a> for more information on adding digital Medicare cards to the wallet.</p>

<p>The digital Medicare card has not replaced physical cards. Health professionals can choose whether to accept a patient’s digital Medicare card. Accepting a digital Medicare card is voluntary, so customers should be encouraged to carry their physical Medicare card.</p>

<p>Health professionals can scan the QR code using the myGov app on a mobile device if the practice or location has one. There is no requirement to sign into the app to scan the QR code.</p>

<p>Medicare Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) cards are not automatically replaced. Where a request over the telephone to re-issue a RHCA card due to being lost or damaged is received, the Service Officer will need to check the expiry date of the Medicare card.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the card is not due to expire for over a month, a Medicare card can be reissued to the address given by the customer</li>

If the card is due to expire in less than a month the card can be re-issued, however the production control address must be used to prevent a Medicare card from being produced, while still enabling the person to make a claim</li>
