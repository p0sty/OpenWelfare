<p>This document outlines eligibility requirements for the employment income nil rate period provision. This provision enables a customer to retain certain benefits, such as a concession card when their rate of income support payment is nil due to the effect of the Income Test. This only occurs when the customer's total ordinary income <strong>includes</strong> employment income.</p>

<p>A customer may qualify for an employment income nil rate period if their social security pension or benefit is not payable because of ordinary income, made up entirely or partly of employment income and they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receive a social security pension or benefit, except&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Special Benefit (<a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#spb">SpB</a>) customers, or</li>
			<li>
Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) customers of Age Pension age</li>		</ul>
		<li>
remain qualified for their social security pension or benefit, including meeting the employment qualifications (employment qualifications exist for Jobseeker Payment (<a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#jsp">JSP</a>), Carer Payment (<a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#cp">CP</a>), Disability Support Pension (<a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#dsp">DSP</a>) and Youth Allowance (<a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/social-security-guide/acronyms#ya">YA</a>) (job seeker), and</li>
		<li>
continue to satisfy the payability provisions for their social security pension or benefit, except for being not payable due to the income</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the income nil rate period occurs for 6 consecutive full fortnights, the customer’s payment will automatically cancel, See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-05.html">Resources</a> for examples.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-22121442-01.html">Extended suspension periods for pension payments</a> for pension payments for Age Pension (AGE)/DSP and those with CP partners.</p>

<p>A customer may have multiple income nil rate periods without having to reclaim if basic qualification for the income support payment is still met.</p>

<p>There is no limit to how many times a customer can enter an employment income nil rate period.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Age Pension (AGE)</strong></p>

<p>Age Pension (AGE) customers can be suspended for up to 2 years if their Australian employment income precludes them from payment for more than 6 fortnights in a row. When the customer reports their employment income on the seventh fortnight of the employment income nil rate period, they will automatically be placed into the extended suspension period if their rate of payment is still nil. The suspension reason code is ESP. Staff must not code this suspension manually.</p>

<p>If the customer has a partner who receives AGE, DSP or Carer Payment (CAR), they will automatically be placed into the extended suspension period if their payment has also been reduced to nil rate due to employment income. The suspension reason code is EPP. Staff must not code this suspension manually.</p>

<p><strong>Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>

<p>DSP customers can be suspended, or cancelled deemed suspended, for up to 2 years if their employment income (combined with their partner’s employment income, if applicable), precludes them from payment. This does not have to be solely due to employment income earnt in Australia. They can earn employment income from any location. When the customer reports their employment income on the seventh fortnight of the employment income nil rate period, they are automatically placed into the extended suspension period if their payment is still nil rate. The suspension reason will be EAN. Staff must not code this suspension manually. If a customer reports their income late, their payment may be cancelled deemed suspended for reason code EAL (which is coded manually).</p>

<p>DSP customers can also have their payment suspended if they work 30 or more hours per week in open employment on an ongoing basis. This requires assessment by a Service Officer, who manually suspends the customer’s DSP if appropriate. The reason code is FTW or FTY.</p>

<p>If the customer has a partner who receives AGE, DSP or CAR, the partner is automatically placed into the extended suspension period if their payment is also nil due to employment income. The suspension reason code is EPP. Staff must <strong>not </strong>code this suspension manually.</p>

<p><strong>Carer Payment (CAR)</strong></p>

<p>Carer Payment (CAR) customers who earn employment income cannot access the extended suspension period unless they also have a partner receiving AGE or DSP who is also earning income. They may also access the extended suspension period if they are not earning any employment income, but have a partner on AGE or DSP who is earning employment income.</p>

<p>In both cases, they are automatically placed into the extended suspension period if their rate of payment is reduced to nil due to employment income. The suspension reason code is EPP. Staff must not code this suspension manually.</p>

<p>Where the pension payment cancels, suspends or reduces to nil rate due to employment income, the pension status will automatically adjust to CZR (Current Zero Rate) for reason PLS. This allows the customer's loan to continue, providing the customer is still otherwise qualified for the applicable pension.

		<ul>		<li>
an employment income nil rate period can continue if their relationship status changes, and</li>
		<li>
their PP is reassessed (transfers between PPS and PPP)</li>
