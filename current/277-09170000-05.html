<h3>Example of objection lodged outside the 28/90 day timeframe</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
M and F are assessed for the costs of the child A, who is in the shared care of M and F</li>
		<li>
M notified Child Support on 13 August that the care of A had changed on 1 August. Child Support made a care percentage decision on 26 August, deciding that a change had occurred, that M now had 40% care and F had 60% care</li>
		<li>
F objected to that decision on 11 December, explaining that they were not able to lodge the objection earlier. Child Support considered the objection and decided on 6 February to allow the objection, as M’s care percentage is 36% and F’s care percentage is 64%</li>
		<li>
Child Support then considered if special circumstances prevented F from lodging the objection within 28 days. Child Support is satisfied that special circumstances did exist. Child Support then considered if the discretion to extend the period should be exercised. Child Support is satisfied that F did not rest on their rights and that M would not be prejudiced by a decision to extend the period in which to lodge the objection. Child Support makes a determination under s87AA(2) that the objection was lodged within time</li>
		<li>
The assessment is amended from 1 August to use the objection decision percentages (M 36% and F 64%) to replace the original care percentage decision</li>
		</ul>
<p>If special circumstances exist, but it is not appropriate to extend the lodgement period to the date that the objection was lodged, do not exercise the discretion to extend the lodgement period. Process the decision as if there are no special circumstances. Go to Step 4.</p>

<p>Advise both customers they have appeal rights to the AAT on the objection decision and on the determination regarding the date of effect under s87AA(2).</p>

<p>The customer may lodge an application to have the objection decision, the date of effect or both components of the objection reviewed by AAT.</p>

<p>If further assistance is required to determine whether special circumstances exist, contact a Service Support Officer (SSO).</p>

<p>Update the special circumstances in the Objection Maintenance window and record the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the applicant has applied for special circumstances and the date of effect needs to be determined for the objection decision, consideration of special circumstances must be finalised in time for the objection to be processed within the legislated timeframes.</p>

<p>Kevin and Jodie have 1 child called Justin who is in Jodie's 100% care. On 1 August 2018, a care change occurs and Kevin now has 100% care of Justin. Services Australia is not notified of the change in care until 8 March 2019 (more than 26 weeks after the care change occurred). </p>

<p>As Jodie's care reduces below 35% care from 1 August 2018 (date of event) and Kevin's increase percentage of care cannot be used in the assessment until 8 March 2019 (date of notification), a terminating event occurs on 1 August 2018. Neither parent has a care percentage of 35% or more. When Services Australia was advised of the change in care on 8 March 2019, a new application for child support is required if either parent wants to restart the case.</p>

<p>Jodie lodges an objection on 1 May 2019. The original care decision is reviewed and an objection decision is made. The decision is that from 1 August 2018 Jodie has 100% care of Justin. The new care determination applies from 1 May 2019, the date the objection was received. As the assessment was terminated, Jodie will need to make a new application for child support.</p>
