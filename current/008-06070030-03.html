The report needs to be checked and actioned, either by accepting or returning the report via the <strong>JCA Report Complete</strong> screen. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-01.html">Checking and actioning a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report</a></li>

<p>When the report is accepted, the status will remain 'Submitted' for 28 days.</p>

<p>The report becomes Finalised from day 29, or when a staff member with suitable access requests early finalisation of the JCA report. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070090-01.html">Request to finalise an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report to create a new JCA referral</a>.</p>

A new assessment referral cannot be made while there is an existing report with a status of submitted (not yet finalised). In some cases it may be necessary to manually finalise the existing report, to allow a new referral to proceed</li>
		<li>
If a customer requests a copy of the JCA report while the status is 'Submitted', they must lodge a Freedom of Information - I want to access or change documents (SI031).

<p>If the status label is 'Unable to Complete', the Assessor could not finalise the assessment. This may be due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customer non-attendance</li>
		<li>
incorrect referral for example, the correct procedure for referring a DSP customer volunteering for employment assistance was not followed</li>
		<li>
the customer does not consent to sharing information</li>
		<li>
Services Australia or the Employment Services Provider who initiated the referral, determines an assessment is no longer required at this time</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Assessor may give further rationale for the reasons why the report cannot be completed in the Assessment Summary section of the report. Any additional information required should be obtained by contacting the Assessor by phone and clearly recorded on a <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

If the customer does not consent to sharing information&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the Assessor must have read the Client Information Sharing Statement (CISS) to the customer and explained the possible consequences of not proceeding with the JCA at the beginning of the interview</li>

any claim may be rejected or the customer may be required to participate in an activity that is inappropriate for them</li>			</ul>			</ul>

<p>Where a customer is assessed as manifestly eligible for DSP, the Assessor selects the appropriate category from a drop down box in the Summary tab of the report.

<p>This is only populated for grandfathered customers.</p>

<p>If the Assessor considers the customer could only achieve part-time or full-time work capacity with ongoing support (that is, support for more than 2 years) or would require Supported Wage System (SWS) or productivity-based wage arrangements, then the 'with intervention' field is coded as 0-7 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> despite being unable to work independently of a Program of Support within 2 years and having a work capacity of 0-7 hours the customer is eligible for assistance under Disability Employment Services (DES) if the Assessor has recommended the customer is able to maintain employment of 8 or more hours with ongoing support.</p>

<p>These ratings are used to assist&#58;</p>

<p><strong>High rating</strong></p>

<p>A high rating is recommended where the Assessor is of the opinion the customer is likely to have significant and ongoing difficulty complying with Participation or mutual obligation requirements due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cognitive or neurological impairment</li>
		<li>
homelessness - beyond the control of the customer</li>
		<li>
significant lack of literacy and language skills</li>
		<li>
recent traumatic relationship breakdown</li>
		<li>
the customer is a recently released prisoner</li>
		<li>
significant caring responsibilities</li>
		<li>
psychiatric/psychological problems</li>
		<li>
severe drug or alcohol dependence, or</li>
		<li>
treatment demands of a medical condition</li>
		</ul>
<p>The degree of insight that the customer has into their condition and episodic fluctuations also factor into this rating.</p>

<p><strong>Moderate rating</strong></p>

<p>A medium rating is recommended where the Assessor is of the opinion the customer's capacity to comply is compromised by temporary or ongoing barriers, but they have some support and coping strategies.</p>

<p>The degree of insight the customer has into their condition and episodic fluctuations also factor into this rating.</p>

<p><strong>Low rating</strong></p>

<p>A low rating is recommended where the Assessor is of the opinion the customer is unlikely to have difficulties complying with Participation or mutual obligation requirements based on the barriers and/or medical conditions identified.</p>

For customers living in a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) launch site who meet relevant age criteria for that site, any ADE referral is managed by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA). Customers who are in a NDIS launch site and who meet relevant age criteria for that site and are interested in a referral to ADE should be referred directly to the NDIA. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-02010000-01.html">Australian Disability Enterprises (ADE) referrals</a></li>
		<li>
If a customer with mutual obligation requirements is referred to a provider who does not have access to update Job Plans (such as ADE), Services Australia will update the customer's Job Plan</li>
		<li>
The report states 'A referral was recommended to (program type)' to indicate the program is considered suitable by the Assessor</li>
			<ul>			<li>
This appears regardless of whether the referral can be actioned immediately, or whether it has been coded on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations system</li>
			<li>
The Assessor should have made at least a physical referral to the program provider</li>
			<li>
Details should be shown in the Assessment Summary section</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Referral recommendations for customers with mutual obligation requirements</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The customer should be contacted to discuss and make the program referral</li>
			<li>
An exception is where the customer is currently receiving assistance from a provider and it is more appropriate for the provider to discuss the new referral with the customer and to action the referral</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the Assessor has also recommended further programs for the client to improve work capacity, details of the program and recommended timeframe are added here</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Additional activities such as pain management or counselling will be achieved through the appropriate referral to one of the 4 main referral options (Employment Services Provider and DES)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Four main referral options are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Workforce Australia Employment Services</li>
		<li>
Disability Employment Service-Disability Management Service DES-DMS, and</li>
		<li>
Disability Employment Service-Employment Support Service DES-ESS</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a referral is not able to be actioned, the Assessor can provide details here of the program/s and the reason the referral could not be actioned.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers with a medical condition that temporarily reduces their work capacity to 0-7 or 8 - 14 hours per week are voluntary and can choose if they would like to participate with the provider during this time. If they do not engage, their provider referral will be actioned once the temporary reduced work capacity period expires.</p>
