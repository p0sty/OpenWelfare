<p><strong>PPL and DAP</strong></p>

<p>Generally, customers must claim PPL and DAP before the first anniversary of the child’s placement for the purpose of adoption. The entry into care is the first date the child was placed with the parent as part of the adoption process or surrogacy arrangement.</p>

<p>However, to receive the maximum amount they must claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
within the time limits for claiming the maximum PPL period for PPL</li>
		<li>
at least 14 days before the child’s first birthday or first anniversary of adoption/surrogacy for DAP</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</strong></p>

<p>CCS can only be backdated a maximum of 28 days from date of claim lodgement. However, the start date must be the Monday of a CCS fortnight. The system determines the start date when the claim is processed.</p>

<p><strong>Has the child already entered the customer's care?</strong></p>

<p>Customers must provide information confirming the child has entered their care as part of the process of adoption or surrogacy. They must supply this before receiving payments.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation to verify</strong></p>

<p><strong>Adoption</strong></p>

<p>The customer may have adopted, or be in the process of adopting, a child from Australia (local) or overseas. Where the adoption occurred will determine what evidence is required/available.</p>

<p><strong>Australian (Local) Adoption</strong></p>

<p>As part of the adoption process in Australia, a customer is required to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
initially be assessed as suitable to adopt a child by their relevant state or territory child protection agency</li>
		<li>
complete a formal application for adoption</li>
		</ul>
<p>This process is relevant for all adoptions in Australia, including open adoptions where the birth parents retain ongoing contact with the child. </p>

<p>Once the application for adoption is complete, customers adopting a child are issued adoption papers. This confirms&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the child has been placed in their care for the purpose of adoption, and </li>
		<li>
they are in the process of adopting the child</li>
		</ul>
<p>It also confirms the care arrangement is not a permanent care order with a view to adopt the child or a potential adoption. </p>

<p>If a customer does not have a completed application of adoption submitted to the courts, the child is not in care for the purpose of adoption. </p>

<p>In open adoptions, the child may initially have been entrusted to the customers care as part of a permanent care order. Treat these customers as formal foster carers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Customers claiming for a child entrusted to their care as part of a closed adoption process will not generally have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the child’s Australian birth certificate, displaying the birth parents details, or </li>
		<li>
the Newborn Declaration Form (FA081)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The agency can use the adoption orders as verification of the child's birth.</p>

<p>The child’s previous carer/s and/or biological parent/s information will not be included in any adoption documents. Service Officers may need to contact the relevant state or territory agency or authorised agency to get the previous carer’s/birth parents information where the child’s CRN cannot be located. Service Officer can get this information verbally.</p>

<p>As the previous carer/birth parents information is confidential and not usually provided to adoptive parents, once received, <strong>do not</strong> scan this information to the customer’s record. If the customer provides these documents, refer the case to the <a href="../families/007-07010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Helpdesk_for_st">Level 2 Policy Helpdesk</a>. They will arrange appropriate storage of the document.</p>

<p>Where a customer has a birth certificate or other proof of birth for the child identifying the birth parents, it is essential to confirm if the child was initially entrusted to the customer’s care as part of the adoption process or under a permanent care order issued by a court or authorised agency.</p>

<p><strong>Long term/permanent care of the child until the child is 18 years of age</strong></p>

<p>These are not adoptions, nor has the child been placed in the customers care for the purpose of adoption. </p>

<p>Long term/permanent care orders are a formal foster care arrangement, and these customers are not eligible for PPL or DAP for the child. For example, Bernados has provided a letter indicating the child has been placed in the customers care with the ‘view to adopt’, 'potential adoption' or as ‘part of an adoption process’.</p>

<p><strong>Overseas Adoption</strong></p>

<p>When a customer adopts a child from overseas they will have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
adoption papers, or</li>
		<li>
other confirmation from an authorised party stating the child has been entrusted to the customer's care as part of the process</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Surrogacy</strong></p>

<p>Customers may have entered into an Australian altruistic surrogacy arrangement or an overseas surrogacy arrangement, which could be commercial or altruistic. Depending on where the customer made the arrangement will determine what evidence is required.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Surrogacy arrangement</strong></p>

<p>A surrogacy arrangement entered into within Australia must meet the relevant state or territory law. In all Australian states and territories, the surrogacy agreement must be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
altruistic (the surrogate does not receive any financial payment or other reward for acting as a surrogate)</li>
		<li>
signed and finalised by all parties, generally through solicitors <strong>before</strong> the surrogate becoming pregnant</li>
		</ul>
<p>Commissioning parents are required to apply for a parentage order before the child is 6 months of age (12 months for South Australia). Most commissioning parents will not have the parentage order completed before claiming PPL. The surrogacy agreement and confirmation that the surrogate has relinquished care of the child is acceptable evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a Parenting agreement or custody order is <strong>not</strong> a parentage order. It would generally indicate the customer does not have surrogacy agreement that meets their state or territory legislation. These customers may still be eligible for PPL or DAP in exceptional circumstances. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Overseas surrogacy arrangement</strong></p>

<p>The majority of Overseas surrogacy arrangements Services Australia sees are commercial. This means there is usually a contract and the commissioning parents financially compensate the surrogate for carrying the child for them.</p>

<p>All parties involved must sign the finalised surrogacy agreement before the surrogate becomes pregnant.</p>

<p>Following the birth, the commissioning parents will have the child’s birth certificate, passport, and court documents confirming the child has been placed into their care as part of a surrogacy arrangement.</p>

<p>If the Service Officer cannot make a determination, refer the case to the Service Support Officer (SSO) via the Direct Referral to SSO webform. The SSO may then determine a referral to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk via the Online Form is required.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Surrogacy agreement referrals are only required as part of the post-birth claim process. Before completing the referral, make sure the customer has provided all details of the surrogacy arrangement and relevant documentation.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-07010010-05.html">Resources</a> page contains links to the Direct Referral to SSO webform and the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk Online Query form.</p>

<p><strong>Kinship care</strong></p>

<p>Kinship care applies to children placed with relatives (kin), or individuals without a blood relation but who have a relationship with the child or family. For example, a person from the child's or family's community.</p>

<p><strong>FTB</strong></p>

<p>Customers may be eligible to receive FTB, including NBS/NBU for a child entrusted to their care under a kinship care arrangement. </p>

<p><strong>PPL and DAP </strong></p>

<p>Kinship carers are treated the same as foster parents. Customers who have taken on the caring responsibilities for a child under kinship care are not eligible for PPL or DAP.</p>

<p><strong>Meriba Omasker Kaziw Kazipa Act 2020 </strong></p>

<p>Queensland customers may have a child entrusted to their care under the <strong>Meriba Omasker Kaziw Kazipa</strong> (Torres Strait Islander Traditional Child Rearing Practice) Act 2020. This Act provides legal recognition in Queensland of Torres Strait Islander families’ continued use of traditional child rearing practice. </p>

<p>Generally, children entrusted to the customers care under this Act will be treated the same as formal foster care for PPL purposes. However, if the customer has applied for a Cultural Recognition Order (CRO), the agency may consider an authorised party placed the child for the purpose of adoption. Once the CRO is finalised by the commissioner under the <strong>Meriba Omasker Kaziw Kazipa</strong> law the child is considered as adopted. This law only applies to Queensland customers. See <a href="../families/007-07010010-05.html">Resources</a> for examples. </p>
