<p>When an online claim or ACC is submitted, a DAP claim Work Item is generated on the customer's record. This new claim activity contains all the claim information provided by the customer online or entered into ACC by a Service Officer.</p>

<p><strong>Paper claim lodged</strong></p>

<p>When a paper claim (FA080) is scanned to the customer's record, a Social Application (SOA) shell Work Item is generated. This new claim activity contains no claim information apart from the CRN, personal details and the receipt date (date of claim). Claim information will need to be manually updated within the Work Item using information from the scanned paper claim and any associated documentation.</p>

<p>Where a paper claim did not create a new claim activity, manually create a SOA shell  via the Process Direct Landing page.</p>

<p><strong>To create a blank SOA shell for a claim</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>Customers who do not meet the DAP work test are asked in their online claim if there were any special circumstances that affected their ability to meet the work test. If a customer indicates they were affected by family and domestic violence, a priority keyword (<strong>PPLFDV</strong>) is automatically added to the claim work item.</p>

<p>The customer must provide evidence of employment confirming they would have worked during the work test period. The customer's employer may not know why the customer was unable to work, and the customer is not expected to tell their employer.</p>

<p>A social worker referral needs to be completed when allocated a family and domestic violence claim.</p>

<p>Before sending a social working referral, check the customer's employment evidence lodged with their claim to assess if sufficient. For evidence requirements, see <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">Paid Parental Leave scheme Work Test</a>.</p>

<p>If not sufficient, attempt to contact the customer by phone to request the missing claim information. Issue a written request for information for the employment evidence (even if verbally discussed with customer) using <strong><img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/more%20options.png" alt="" title="" /></strong> <strong>Request Documents</strong>.</p>

<p>Before calling, use <a href="../self-service/133-05000000-01.html">Desktop Electronic Messaging Capability (DEMC)</a> to advise the customer they will receive a phone call.</p>

<p>If the customer needs help from a Social Worker to get the relevant employment evidence, include this in the referral <strong>DOC/Notes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Error E340CU - DAP claimant advised marital status change</strong></p>

<p>If the DAP customer has advised a change of marital status in the claim the Accommodation Details (<strong>AC</strong>) screen may require coding. If the <strong>AC</strong> screen presents with error E340CU; ACR details do not match the customer's relationship status, the following workaround is to be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Current on payment when marital status changed</strong></p>

<p>If the customer or partner were receiving income support payment or FTB on the date the marital status changed, action the marital status and <strong>AC</strong> coding using the relevant income support payment or FTB coding rules.</p>

<p>To action the change, contact the customer to confirm the details that applied on the date of marital status change. For example, accommodation details, partner FTB income estimate.</p>

<p>If on the date of separation the customer was receiving&#58;</p>

<p>DAP is treated as income when calculating the rate of payment for a customer or partner on income support payment (ISP).</p>

<p>Customers (and/or their partners) may&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
receive a reduced rate of ISP during the DAP period or</li>
		<li>
lose their entitlement to their ISP and any associated concession cards (that is cancellation of ISP</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>If DAP is granted for a date in the past, an overpayment of ISP may occur for the customer or their partner. The overpayment will automatically calculate on the Activity Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen.</p>

<p><strong>Before finalising the claim</strong>, attempt one outbound contact to customers to discuss potential payment impacts claiming DAP will have on their ISP. If appropriate the customer may change their nominated start date to another date in the future to prevent being overpaid their ISP. See <a href="../families/007-05040030-03.html">Change of circumstances for Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)</a>.</p>

<p>If unable to contact the customer or the customer is unable to nominate a different date, continue to finalise the claim.</p>

Affected customers can discuss their circumstances with their Farm Household Case Officer (FHCO) or call the Farmer Assistance Hotline. If a customer asks for FHA to be cancelled, advise they will have to submit a new claim if they would like to receive payments in the future.
