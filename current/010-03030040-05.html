<p><strong>Geographical isolation Rules 1 and 2</strong></p>

<p>Most families claiming AIC due to geographical isolation do not normally need to provide evidence. Where the distance(s) from the principal family home to the nearest state school(s) and/ or any transport services to those schools that are being claimed are just over the minimum AIC geographical isolation criteria, evidence will normally be needed.</p>

state school(s) under Rule 1 is between 56 and 59 km</li>
		<li>
state school(s) under Rule 2 is between 16 and 19 km</li>
		<li>
transport pick-up point to the state school(s) is between 4.5 and 7 km</li>

<p>Where the applicant is claiming AIC due to excessive travel time, they will need to provide evidence.</p>

<p>For example, the return travel time(s) from the principal family home to the nearest state school(s) via any transport service(s) to those schools is at least 180 minutes. This is the minimum requirement under Rule 3.</p>

<p><strong>Special needs</strong></p>

<p>The SY099 Medical Statement form is used as medical evidence. In some cases, it may be necessary to review the supporting medical documents provided by specialists to make an assessment. </p>

<p>Students with special needs should normally provide supporting evidence each year. This ensures a change in circumstances does not affect their eligibility.</p>

<p>Evidence is not needed for each year in the following cases&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the student's condition is permanent and requires ongoing access to special facilities not available locally</li>
		<li>
the evidence provided the previous year indicated the student's treatment or course will continue for the current year</li>
		<li>
the student had a special need in year 11 and is entering year 12 at the same school (and is eligible for the year 12 Continuity of Schooling concession)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For temporary circumstances, evidence must include an estimate of how long the condition or circumstance will continue. If an estimate is not possible, the form should be dated no earlier than 1 July of the year before the one to which the claim relates.</p>

<p><strong>Claim based on students with special needs where medical evidence is not required</strong></p>

<p>No evidence is needed for students needing to live <strong>full-time at a special school</strong> or at a special institution which specifically caters for students with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
disabilities</li>
		<li>
other health-related conditions or</li>
		<li>
learning difficulties</li>
		</ul>
<p>For students needing <strong>testing and /or specialist learning support</strong> for a diagnosed learning difficulty, ask for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a statement from the relevant education authorities supporting the need for the testing/support program and that the required testing or support is not available locally, and</li>
		<li>
evidence from the school or facility giving details of the program (in the case of a student needing learning support)</li>
		</ul>
<p>An education authority could include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
state/territory education authority</li>
		<li>
Catholic education office, or</li>
		<li>
similar body for other independent schools</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Who can complete or provide the medical evidence?</strong></p>

<p>Medical evidence is from a medical practitioner, specialist (where the condition requires specialist treatment) or in some circumstances an allied health professional.</p>

<p>Evidence provided by an allied health professional <strong>must satisfy</strong> all of the following criteria as a minimum&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Demonstrated capacity to provide the evidence in relation to the special needs claim, for example a psychologist providing evidence of a special need relating to trauma</li>
		<li>
A tertiary qualification (as a minimum)</li>
		<li>
Accredited and registered as needed in the state or territory in order to provide consultation on a public or private basis</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the allied health professional meets <strong>any of the following additional criteria</strong> in relation to the special need, the evidence they provide is to be given <strong>greater weight</strong> in establishing the special need. This could be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a specialisation </li>
		<li>
demonstrated experience, or </li>
		<li>
an additional qualification, for example a Masters level qualification in clinical psychology</li>
		</ul>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, evidence may be sought from an allied health professional when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
due to distance or isolation, it would be an unfair burden on the family to source evidence from a medical practitioner</li>
		<li>
a medical practitioner refers the student to an allied health professional, for example a referral to a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist</li>
		<li>
the medical practitioner is considered unsuitable by the family to provide advice, for example, when the only doctor near the family home is a male doctor, and the student is a female. They may wish to see a female allied health professional in cases of sexual trauma or mental health </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of Allied Health Professionals</strong> are (but not limited to)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Audiologist</li>
		<li>
Occupational Therapist</li>
		<li>
Optometrist</li>
		<li>
Physiotherapist</li>
		<li>
Psychologist</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment of special needs medical evidence</strong></p>

<p>For students needing <strong>access to special facilities</strong> for a health-related condition or students needing to <strong>live in a different environment </strong>for health reasons, the evidence needs to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
establish the nature of the condition</li>
		<li>
show the facilities or environment are not accessible at a local school or in the vicinity of the student's principle family home</li>
		<li>
confirm the student's condition is better managed or overcome by access to the facilities or environment</li>
		<li>
outline how the facility or the environment will aid the management of the condition<br><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if the medical evidence does not specify the above, <strong>a statement from the facility or environment</strong> outlining how it will aid the management of the condition is required</li>
		</ul>
<p>For students needing to <strong>study from home</strong>, the medical evidence needs to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
establish the nature of the condition</li>
		<li>
show it would be harmful to the student's health (not merely a discomfort) if they were to attend school daily (excluding pregnancy)</li>
		</ul>
<p>For students needing to be <strong>removed from the local school environment for</strong> <strong>health reasons or expulsion</strong>, ask for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a statement from the delegate of the CEO of the state/territory education authority (not local school) stating&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the reason for the removal of the student (in broad terms only, for example interpersonal problems affecting health, expulsion)</li>
			<li>
the family and the school have attempted, without success, to resolve the problem, and</li>
			<li>
there is no suitable local school that the student can attend daily</li>		</ul>
		<li>
medical evidence to establish&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the nature of the condition, and</li>
			<li>
linkage between the condition and the need for the student to be removed from the local school environment</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For medical conditions that are not clearly serious, the evidence must show that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is no suitable medication or treatment that is both reasonably available and able to alleviate the effects of the condition</li>
		<li>
the condition is likely to result in the student being absent from local schooling on at least 20 school days in a year</li>		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
was placed into boarding</li>
		<li>
a second home has been set up so the student has access to schooling, or</li>

boarding</li>
		<li>
studying by distance education, or other approved education, or</li>
		<li>
living in the second home</li>
