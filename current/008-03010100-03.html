<p><strong>Duplicate claims</strong> (where a second claim is submitted within 13 weeks of a previous claim)</p>

<p><a href="../people-with-disability/008-03010010-01.html">Claims for DSP</a> can be submitted at any time. If a customer lodges a DSP claim within the qualification period (for example, 13 weeks) of a previously submitted DSP claim, Service Officers must determine how each claim should be progressed.</p>

<p>Attempt to contact the customer/nominee to establish their reason or intent in lodging a second claim.</p>

<p>Customers can also choose to withdraw the subsequent claim. See <a href="../self-service/133-03010130-01.html">Cancel or Withdraw an online claim</a> and <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040050-01.html">Withdrawal of claims</a>.

		<ul>		<li>
ask for the claim to be reinstated</li>
		<li>
appeal the decision</li>
		</ul>
<p>Do not withdraw a claim if the customer has not been contacted. If contact is not successful, or the customer wishes to pursue assessment of the subsequent claim, progress claim per normal process. <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03010100-03.html#bp03_tbl_Commence_stream_Step02">Go to Step 2</a>.</p>

<p>For help with multiple claims, or where the customer has attended a JCA/DMA supporting grant, for the second DSP Claim, Service Officers can contact Level 2 Policy Helpdesk. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03010100-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Re-provided claims</strong> (where customer has lodged the same DSP paper claim form) </p>

<p>A re-provided claim can be considered a legal claim, if the claim is complete, and meets the claim lodgement requirements, See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03020000-01.html">Claim lodgement of Centrelink claims</a>. </p>

<p>Action required depends on the status of the original DSP claim and contact with the customer/nominee to confirm the reason for lodging the second claim. A claim cannot be cancelled or withdrawn, without the customer/nominee agreeing to it.</p>

<p>Review the DSP Claim Progress Doc/ Notes to determine the status of original claim. </p>

<p>Where the original DSP claim was rejected in the last 13 weeks&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Try to contact the customer/nominee to establish their reason for re-lodging the claim</li>

If the customer lodged the claim seeking a review of original claim decision, they can withdraw the second claim and either ask for a&#58;</li>

reassessment of the original claim (if rejection reason was FRC/FSD/POI/IME or GCD), see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060060-01.html">Request to reassess a rejected claim</a>, or </li>

If a customer/nominee cannot be contacted, or they do not agree to withdraw the second claim, the claim must be progressed, as normal, <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03010100-03.html#bp03_tbl_Commence_stream_Step02">go to Step 2</a> </li>

<p>Check if the customer is ineligible on the following non-medical grounds&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Residence</strong>. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03050010-01.html">Residence assessment for customers claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP)</a> to determine if the customer satisfies residence requirements for DSP</li>
		<li>
Where the customer has less than 10 years Australian residence and no QRE, an assessment of 'where the customer's <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03040010-01.html">Continuing Inability to Work (CITW)</a> occurred' is needed</li>
		<li>
Where MAT has assessed the customer as manifestly medically eligible, MAT will assess where CITW occurred. If CITW has not been assessed, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03010100-03.html#bp03_tbl_Process_and_fin_Step09">Step 9 in Table 4</a></li>
		<li>
Where a JCA referral is required, JCA will assess where CITW occurred. No more assessment of residence eligibility can be made until JCA has been submitted. Staff must correctly answer the Residence/QRE question in the JCA referral in Process Direct</li>
		<li>
The <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03010100-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the DSP Residency Screens Checklist. This has more information about assessing a customer's residency status</li>

over Age Pension age, tell the customer to <a href="../older-australians/065-03010000-01.html">claim Age Pension</a></li>
			<li>
under 15 years and 9 months (early claim provision), tell the customer to re-apply when age requirement is met</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Income and Assets</strong>. Reject the claim if, based on the information contained in the claim and supporting documents, the customer is clearly not entitled under the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03010000-01.html">Pensions income or assets test</a>. Check the Pension Income &amp; Asset Summary (<strong>PIAS</strong>) screen to make sure there is no historical information requiring an update. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if customers' medical eligibility is complete, the system will identify the correct rejection reason. If medical eligibility is yet to be established, use rejection reason <strong>DIA </strong>(excess income and/or assets). See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030150-03.html">Rejecting a new claim for Disability Support Pension (DSP) including manifest rejections</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Tax File Number</strong>. Check customer has supplied a TFN or authority to use their TFN from a previous claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Where the customer has provided evidence they have lodged an application with the ATO, record the TFN category as <strong>CAT</strong></li>
			<li>
In limited circumstances, a customer can be exempt from supplying a TFN. For example, where a customer is assessed as medically eligible for DSP and considered profoundly disabled, and no other person, such as a nominee is handling their affairs, or, the other person is having difficulty complying with the TFN request</li>
			<li>
For more information, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060020-01.html">Requesting a Tax File Number (TFN)</a></li>
			<li>
Where a TFN exemption is applied, clearly document this in the DSP Claim Progress/Finalisation <strong>DOC</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Imprisonment</strong>. Reject the claim if customer is in prison, charged with an offence and not undertaking a course of rehabilitation, or found guilty and convicted of an offence, and the release date is not within 3 weeks of date of claim. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> If customer has entered prison after lodging the claim, continue to assess the claim for potential eligibility for the period before entering prison.

<p>MEDSA466 lodged without a DSP claim is <strong>not</strong> considered a claim. The correct <strong>DOR</strong> is the date a complete claim is lodged.</p>

it is an early claim, for example, customer is 15 years and 9 months. PNA needs to be changed to customers 16th birthday</li>

update the PNA to correctly reflect the date of claim assessment</li>
