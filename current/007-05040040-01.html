<p>For a PPL claim for a child born on or after 1 July 2023, a customer is able to return to work without losing eligibility. See <a href="../families/007-23020214-01.html">Claiming and managing Paid Parental Leave (PPL) days for children born or entering care on or after 1 July 2023</a>. </p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Primary claimants must claim the PPL period within 12 months of the child’s date of birth (DOB) or adoption. Generally, a customer <strong>must </strong>lodge their claim for PPL before they return to work.</p>

<p>Unless working for an allowable exception reason, if a primary claimant has returned to work before claiming PPL they will not be eligible for the PPL period, but they can still be eligible for the 30 Flexible PPL days. Flexible PPL days can be paid before and after the customer returns to work. However, the customer cannot perform work on the date they are claiming Flexible PPL.</p>

<p>Customers who have returned to work can still make a claim for PPL and transfer the PPL period to their partner, or another primary carer. In this case, they may choose to keep the 30 Flexible PPL days, give the Flexible days to the new primary carer, or a combination of both.</p>

<p>A primary claimant can claim PPL after they have returned to work and be eligible for the PPL period if the customer&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
has&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
lodged an effective claim within 28 days of the child's DOB, and </li>
			<li>
had a Nominated Start Date (NSD) of the child's DOB or a date before they return to work</li>		</ul>
		<li>
meets the extended work test or received COVID-19 Disaster Payment (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021) during their 10 month qualifying period and elects a NSD before their return to work date</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information, including claim timeframe see <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">Paid Parental Leave Work Test</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../families/007-05040040-03.html">Process</a> page contains more information in these cases.</p>

<p>A secondary claimant may lodge their claim after returning to work and still be assessed for payment from the first day of their PPL period to the day they returned to work. If assessed as eligible, a secondary claimant’s PPL period will cease to be payable on the date they returned to work.</p>
