<p>In limited cases there may be an incorrect reduction to the rate of FTB part A paid for a child when they turn 18 years of age.</p>

<p>This may occur where the customer has had a Child Support extension granted but the data has not been updated to the customer’s record.</p>

			<li>
the child support agreement ended when the child turned 18, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>
one party took steps to extend the agreement however the other party refused (both parties signatures are required to extend the agreement) The party who attempted to extend the agreement has taken reasonable maintenance action</li>		</ul>
		<li>
an administrative assessment in place before the child turned 18, <strong>and</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
the child's 18th birthday falls in the school holiday period in between 2 secondary school years. When this occurs, Child Support may have rejected the customer’s application to extend the child support case (or may have refused to let the customer apply to extend). The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a scenario</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The maintenance action code of '<strong>MED</strong>' (Manual workaround pass) should be coded (only where approval to do so has been obtained from the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk) to ensure the customer continues to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A where it is deemed reasonable maintenance action was taken.

<p>To continue to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A for a full-time secondary student once the child turns 18 years of age, a payee must apply to Child Support for an extension to their child support assessment <strong>prior</strong> to the child's 18th birthday. The assessment can be extended until the last day of the secondary school year that falls within 365 days of the child's 18th birthday.</p>

<p>If the child's 18th birthday falls in the school holiday period in between 2 secondary school years, Child Support may reject the customer’s application to extend the child support case (or may refuse to let the customer apply to extend). If this occurs, these cases <strong>must be escalated</strong> to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk to consider whether the customer should be treated as meeting the MAT.</p>

<p>If the payee fails to seek an extension, in most cases the MAT requirement will not be met from the 18th birthday and only the base rate of FTB Part A will be payable until the last day of secondary school for the year in which their child turns 18 years.</p>

<p>To continue to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A (and, if applicable, to retain any ancillary benefits), <strong>before the child turns 18 years </strong>the payee must contact Child Support to apply for an extension to their child support case.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> an application for an extension must be lodged before the child's 18th birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances that warrant a late application. Only Child Support can determine if exceptional circumstances apply.</p>

<p>Customers are sent a letter by Child Support 3 months prior to the child turning 18 years, advising&#58;</p>

of the option to extend their assessment or agreement until the last day of secondary school for the year in which the child turns 18 years</li>

<p>FTB customers with a MAT code of <strong>CAM</strong> or <strong>CCC</strong> for the relevant child/ren will be sent a letter 28 days prior to a child turning 18 years old, advising that if they do not apply for an extension to the child support case before the child turns 18 years of age, the amount of FTB they receive will reduce.</p>

<p><strong>Rejection of extension by Child Support</strong></p>

<p>If Child Support reject the application for an extension past the child's 18th birthday because the child is not in secondary study for Child Support purposes, but the child is in a category defined as a full-time secondary student for Centrelink purposes, a manual MAT exemption/pass will need to be applied.

<p>Advise the customer that reasonable action to obtain child support must be taken within 13 weeks (91 days) (the DMA period) of the latest of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date child was born</li>
		<li>
date child entered their care</li>
		<li>
date they separated from the child's other parent</li>
		<li>
date their percentage of actual care increased to 35% or more</li>
		<li>
such later date that they first become entitled to apply for maintenance</li>
		</ul>
<p>The DMA period for the child will be automatically updated if any of the first 4 events are recorded.</p>

<p>Scenarios where the <strong>fifth event</strong> may apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
date of arrival in Australia for customers arriving from overseas. The PDE MAT code must be manually applied from the date of arrival</li>
		<li>
date the other parent of the child/ren moves to a reciprocal country (including Australia) from a non-reciprocal country. The date of event is the date supplied by the customer or the date Services Australia becomes aware of the payer's change of residency, whichever is the earlier.<br>The PDE MAT code must be manually applied from the earlier of the 2 dates</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains examples of the above scenarios.</p>

<p>The <strong>fifth event</strong> (list above) does not trigger a DMA period and the PDE MAT code must be manually applied from the relevant date.</p>

<p>A customer may claim FTB after their DMA period. This may occur when a customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
arrives from overseas and is not yet residentially qualified for FTB Part A (due to serving a <a href="../families/007-05020020-03.html">NARWP</a>), or </li>
		<li>
has a Separated Under One Roof (SUOR) assessment finalised more than 91 days after the separation date </li>
		</ul>
<p>When this occurs, consider whether it is reasonable to expect the customer would have known to take maintenance action upon arriving in Australia or during the SUOR assessment period. If the answer is no, consider extending the DMA period.</p>

<p><strong>Does PDE need to be manually applied to initiate a DMA period?</strong></p>

<p>To manually commence a 13 week DMA period for a customer who meets the fifth criteria of the 13 week (91 day) timeframe, Service Officers must refer the case details to the National ICT Referral Officers (NIRO) via existing NIRO referral protocols. Where appropriate the NIRO will apply a '<strong>PDE</strong>' (Pseudo DMA Event) manual MAT code to simulate a DMA period for the customer.</p>

<p>To refer a record to the NIROs, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Intranet_links">Business Processing Branch</a>, then select the <strong>National ICT Referral Process</strong> link in the Featured content section.</p>

<p>The <strong>PDE</strong> code initiates a DMA period which will trigger issue of MARNL(s) and the creation of reviews.</p>

<p><strong>PDE</strong> appears on the Maintenance Action Input (<strong>MNMA</strong>) screen and results in DMA on the <strong>MNMR</strong> screen. Coding of the PDE MAT code is restricted to NIROs.</p>

<p>For the individual with increased care above 65%, (previous payer under the agreement) to satisfy the MAT, the following action is required&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When an initiating agreement is <strong>suspended</strong> for a child, the parent with increased care (above 65%) of the child is unable to apply to receive child support until the current agreement based assessment ends.
