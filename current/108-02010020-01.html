<p>Dependent customers who are subject to the Parental Means Test and the personal income test will have their fortnightly rate of payment determined by the test that results in the greatest reduction of their payment in that fortnight.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The parent(s)/guardian(s) identified for PIT are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The natural, adoptive or relationship parent(s) of the customer if the customer normally lives with them. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the birth/natural parent is no longer the parent for ABSTUDY purposes when a student has a parent under traditional Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander adoption. This means that the birth parent may be the private board provider, and/or the travel supervisor. The birth parent is not considered the parent when assessing eligibility under the Away from Home award for students in traditional Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander adoption relationships</li>
		<li>
The parent and step-parent if the customer normally lives with them. See the References section in this procedure and in <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02020000-01.html">Changes which may affect the Parental Income Test (PIT)</a> for more information about step-parents</li>
		<li>
If the customer does not normally live with their parent(s) and is wholly or substantially dependent on someone other than a parent, this person may be considered to be the parent for the PIT; for example the customer's grandparent(s). This cannot be the partner of the customer</li>
		<li>
If the customer does not normally live with their parent(s) and their parents are divorced or separated, the PIT is applied to the parent they last lived with. If that parent has a partner who is not the customer’s natural or adoptive parent, the step parent's income is not taken into account if the customer does not normally live with the step-parent. See the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02010020-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Stepparents">Step-parents</a> section below, or</li>
		<li>
If none of the above applies, the PIT is applied to the parent they last lived with. For further information see the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02010020-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Stepparents">Step-parents</a> section below</li>
		<li>
If the customer has been assessed for the Away from Home rate, the parent being used to assess the away from home rate must be the same parent used for the purposes of the PIT. It is not possible to pay the Away From Home rate based on the natural parents and then use someone else's income for the PIT (for example, a grandparent the customer is living with)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in shared custody situations (including parents separated under the same roof), a dependent ABSTUDY or Youth Allowance claimant/recipient nominates the parent with primary care responsibility. In 50/50 shared care situations the customer may nominate which parent they want to use for the purposes of the PIT.</p>

<p>Any parental income above the threshold, is divided among the children within the family pool. The share of the parental income for each child will depend on the maximum amount of the payments for which that particular child is eligible. The total amount of payments for all dependent children contribute to the family pool maximum rate.</p>

<p>A sibling is included in the family pool if they are in receipt of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Youth Allowance (YA), or</li>
		<li>
ABSTUDY Living Allowance, or</li>
		<li>
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA), or</li>

		</ul>
<p>The contribution to the family pool of the FTB and regular care child/ren is the Maximum notional FTB rate (as applied to Youth Payments only). </p>

<p>Both amounts will be included in the family pool calculation if a child receives&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
AIC ABA, or</li>
		<li>
ABSTUDY Living Allowance and/or School Fee Allowance Group 2, and </li>
			<ul>			<li>

meets the definition of an <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/family-assistance-guide/2/1/1/10">FTB child</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/family-assistance-guide/2/1/1/13">regular care child</a> simultaneously</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The contribution to the family pool of the Youth Allowance child is their Maximum Payment Rate</p>

<p>The Family Pool (<strong>NSFP</strong>) screen displays the current and historical maximum payment rate contribution of the customer, and their linked siblings.</p>

<p>If the parental income reduction is less than the Maintenance Income Test Reducible Amount (MRA) and maintenance income is received in respect of the customer, the Maintenance Income Test is calculated. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02040000-01.html">Maintenance Income Test (MIT) for ABSTUDY and Youth Allowance (YA)</a>.</p>

<p>If the parental income reduction is equal to or more than the Maintenance Income Test Reducible Amount (MRA), the family taper of 20% is then applied to the child's share of the parental income above the threshold. This means that the rate of payment is reduced by 20 cents for each dollar of the child's share of their parents' affecting income.</p>

<p><strong>Current at zero rate</strong></p>

<p>YA customers whose payment is current at zero rate are treated as in receipt of payment for the family group for a maximum of 6 consecutive fortnights, after which YA will cancel.</p>

<p>ABSTUDY customers whose payment is current at zero rate are treated as in receipt of payment for the family group. ABSTUDY customers who do not receive Living Allowance will display on the Family Pool Summary (<strong>NSFP</strong>) screen as 'other'. These siblings will have a zero contribution to the family pool.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> YA or ABY customers are not considered to be current at zero rate if they are receiving at least $1 of payment, i.e. Rent Assistance or Youth Disability Supplement.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Taxable income</li>

Adjusted employer provided reportable fringe benefits <strong>including</strong> salary sacrifice. The reportable fringe benefit amount as recorded on a customer's group certificate should be advised and recorded&#58;</li>

<p>For Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY purposes, a step-parent is the married or de facto partner of the parent who has primary care and responsibility of the dependent customer.</p>

<p>The income of the step-parent is included in the Parental Income Test (PIT) for the purposes of determining the rate of Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY Living Allowance for a customer where&#58;</p>

the step-parent lives with the parent, and</li>

<p>The customer is considered to be normally living with the parent and step-parent where the customer's primary home address is the same as the parent and step-parent. This includes customers who live away from home&#58;</p>

		<li>
to undertake their Australian Apprenticeship</li>

to search for work</li>
		<li>
to undertake other activities, and</li>
		<li>
who have not established their own permanent and separate home away from their parent and step-parent. That is, they intend to return to the parental home</li>

<p>Customers living arrangements may be deemed temporary, for example, if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
live in campus accommodation</li>
		<li>
must pack up their belongings and return home during semester break, and</li>
		<li>
will not have a lease during the semester break</li>

<p>For the purposes of the PIT, the step-parent's income should not be included when the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has established a separate home, and</li>
		<li>
has no intention of returning, other than for a visit</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a customer has established a permanent home and they return to the parental home to live, they must notify Services Australia as per their payment notification requirements.</p>
