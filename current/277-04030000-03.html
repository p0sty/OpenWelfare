<p>A payee can make an AFC verbally or in writing (<a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms" target=_blank>AFC form</a>). If the payee resides overseas, they can lodge an AFC personally or it can be lodged on their behalf by an overseas authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the particulars of an AFC can vary until the AFC is 'Accepted', that is, processed in Cuba and letters issued to customers. For example, if the payee claimed $400 of arrears and through discussions with both parents it was agreed $100 was also paid to the payee for child support during, or specifically for, the claimed opt in arrears period, the total claimed arrears would be adjusted to $300.</p></div>

<p>A customer is now a payer (due to a recent role reversal) may still apply for collection where they were previously the payee, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Formulate_calcu_Step01">Step 1 in Table 6</a>.</p>

<p>Occasionally a payee may request collection of child support for children that are not registered on the case. In this situation, before actioning the AFC, the payee must be offered the option to apply for either an <a href="../separated-parents/277-19061108-01.html">assessment</a> or a <a href="../separated-parents/277-05060000-01.html">registration of a court order</a> to register the children. </p>
<p>Advise the payee that collection can only start from the date Child Support receive the completed registration application, not the date the AFC was lodged.</p>
<p>If the AFC is for a Stage 1 case, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Application_for_Step04">go to Step 4</a>. Otherwise, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Application_for_Step05">go to Step 5</a>.</p></div>

<li>determine if they have an existing case - if so, what is their Case Number/CSRN/CRN</li>

<p>The Child Support Registrar is only authorised to collect TFNs in writing. <strong>Do not</strong> ask the customer for their TFN over the telephone. Only add the customers TFN to the Parent Referral and Assessment Guide Workflow if it is already recorded in Cuba.</p>

<p>An AFC is not required for cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>with an initial assessment of zero annual rate, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-19061119-01.html">Finalising the child support assessment application</a>, or</li>
<li>where the customer's roles have reversed and the customer is the payee for the first time, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03020010-01.html">Managing reverse child support cases</a></li></ul>
<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page contains a link to collection policy information about zero annual rates and first time role reversals.</p>
<p>When a payee registers or re-registers their case and elects to collect child support privately, they are making an election under either s23(3) for a Stage 1 case or s24A(2) for a Stage 2 case.</p>
<p>Section 25(1) of the Act allows the payee to reverse that election, asking for collection of child support on their behalf. A payee may also make an election under S28A of the Act to have arrears collected for them.</p>
<p><strong>A 'first time' AFC must be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>A payee may make an application for collection for a liability that has never previously been collected. Child Support must accept the s25(1) application for collection in these cases. They may also make an election under s28A of the Act to have arrears collected for them. If there are arrears payable to them, Child Support must accept the s28A election.</p>

<p>When a customer asks to change their collection arrangement from collect to private collect (by 'opting out'), they are choosing to do so under s38A of the Act. Child Support can also initiate an opt out, under s38B of the Act via the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04320000-01.html">Registrar Initiated Private Collect (RIPC)</a> process.</p>
<p>Section 39 of the Act allows the payee to reverse that election, again asking for collection on their behalf. A payee can also apply under s39A of the Act for the collection of arrears. Payees can ask for collection regardless of whether the previous action to make the case private collect was initiated by the customer or the agency.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> consider family and domestic violence concerns when making a decision on a subsequent AFC. </p>
<p>A subsequent AFC must be granted unless Child Support is satisfied that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the payer has complied with their child support obligations</li>
<li>the payer has explained why their payments were untimely, they have rectified this and regular payments are now being made</li>
<li>special circumstances exist which make it appropriate to refuse the application</li></ul>

<p>Explore the reasons why the payee is lodging an AFC. Explore other options where appropriate. Examples of possible reasons as to why payee lodge an AFC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centrelink advised the payee to apply</li>
<li>a friend told the payee that collection by the agency was the best option</li>
<li>one or several payments have been missed or late</li>
<li>either customer may have moved location</li>
<li>a life event may have occurred which has influenced the customer's decision, for example, either customer has re-partnered, birth of a new child</li>
<li>the parties may have recently separated after a period of reconciliation</li>
<li>the parent is at risk or is experiencing family and domestic violence</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if the applicant indicates they had reconciled with the other party during the private collect period, decide if a suspension or termination of the assessment is appropriate for that period. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 2.10.1: Suspension of liability to pay child support when parents reconcile.</p>
<p>Private collection of child support is the preferred option. Where appropriate take every opportunity to encourage private arrangements.</p>
<p>It may not be appropriate to encourage private arrangements in some circumstances including:</p>
<ul>
<li>where there is a risk of family and domestic violence</li>
<li>there is information to suggest the assessment may be subject to retrospective changes</li>
<li>the customer has been advised by Centrelink to apply for collection because of impacts on their Family Tax Benefit Part A entitlement</li>
<li>when the payer is incarcerated and:</li>
<ul>
<li>the payee cannot collect payments</li>
<li>incomes are not accurate</li></ul></ul>
<p>If cash payments were being made to the payee, are there other suitable options for private payment that can be arranged between the customers? For example, transfer of payments from the payer's bank account to the payee's bank account or could the payer arrange to have salary deductions transferred into the payee's bank account?</p>
<p>If an agreement can be negotiated for periodic and non-periodic amounts, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02000000-01.html">Agreements</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Request up to 3 months arrears</strong></p>

<li>request collection of child support that has not been paid in the 3 months before the opt in date, or</li>
<li>make an application for collection of arrears <strong>after</strong> the opt in is finalised</li></ul>
<p>There is no legal limit to how long the payee can wait to make this application they may ask for arrears to be collected many months after the opt in is accepted.</p>
<p>Advise the payee to notify Centrelink if their application for collection of arrears is accepted as there may be an impact on their FTB entitlement for the private collect period. The payee will need to provide Centrelink with the date that the arrears period covers and any amounts of child support privately paid for the arrears period.</p>
<p>Notify the payer that the 'opt in' amount has been amended and is going to be due and payable. Discuss the circumstances behind the collection request and the best payment arrangement for the payer's circumstances. Follow collection as per <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Contacting_paye_Step01">Step 1 in Table 5</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure the applicant and the other party did not reconcile for any period during the private collect period. This will affect the amount of arrears the applicant can claim. Advise the payee this may affect their FTB.</p>
<p><strong>Request for more than 3 months of arrears</strong></p>
<p>If the payee has requested more than 3 months arrears to be collected, Child Support must be satisfied that 'exceptional' circumstances existed before accepting the application. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for a link The Child Support Guide 5.1.4: Collection of arrears accrued during non-collect period which provides guidance and examples of exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>Advise the payee to notify Centrelink if their application for collection of arrears is accepted as there may be an impact on their FTB entitlement for the private collect period. The payee will need to provide Centrelink with the date that the arrears period covers and any amounts of child support privately paid for the arrears period.</p>
<p>The authorisation to approve a payee's application for more than 3 months arrears is at the Service Officer 4 (SO4) level. When considering such an application, the payee must be advised that the payer's response to the statements about the exceptional circumstances will be sought.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> in some cases there will be sensitive issues involved for example, the payee’s exceptional circumstances may be due to a medical condition or family and domestic violence. The payer needs to know the substance of the claim in order to respond but the amount of information provided to the payer may vary depending on the claim. If unsure how much detail can be provided to the payer, check with a Service Support Officer <strong>before</strong> contact is made. At all times, discuss with the payee the information that will be shared between the parties, particularly if there are family and domestic concerns.</p></div>

<p>The first payment to the agency by the payer will generally be due by the 7th of the month following the first statement that issues to the payer. This could mean the first disbursement may not be made up to one and a half months after lodging an AFC.

<p><strong>Explain apportionment where multiple cases exist</strong></p>
<p>If the payer owes child support to more than one payee and makes a payment for less than the total of the liabilities to each payee, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-06010000-01.html">payment will be apportioned</a> in proportion to the amount each payee is owed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> since 1 January 2007, payees have been able to privately enforce child support debts that are also collectible by Child Support. If a court orders payments under these provisions, the normal apportionment rules may not apply. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 5.4.7: Payee's right to enforce debt via court proceedings or seek Service Support Officer support.</p>
<p><strong>Explain the method Centrelink uses to calculate FTB entitlement for collect customers</strong></p>
<p>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) entitlements are calculated in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entitlement method</li>
<li>Disbursement method</li></ul>
<p>Only payees with the collect option have the choice of these methods.</p>
<p><strong>Entitlement method</strong></p>
<p>This is the default method for all private and child support collect customers. Under this method, FTB Part A is worked out using the amount of child support a person is entitled to receive under a child support assessment. However, the amount of child support a customer actually receives is also taken into account. If a customer:</p>
<ul>
<li>does not receive the full amount of child support they are entitled to over a financial year, they may get a top-up payment</li>
<li>is disbursed an amount that is more than their entitlement for that period. For example, due to the payment of arrears, their payment rate may be reduced to help avoid an overpayment at the end of the financial year</li></ul>
<p><strong>Disbursement method</strong></p>
<p>FTB Part A is calculated using the amount of child support actually received by the customer. This option is only available for collect customers and must be requested by the customer. This method may be appropriate for customers who receive substantially less child support than they are entitled to, or who receive irregular disbursements.</p>
<p>If an AFC is accepted, the customer will be assessed for FTB purposes on the Entitlement method. The payee has to contact Centrelink to discuss the payment method they prefer.

<p>If the payee does not believe the payer will pay, manage their expectations by advising them of the action that can be taken along with possible timeframes. Make sure the payee understands that they will not automatically receive child support just because they have elected for child support collection.</p>
<p>Advise the payee:</p>
<ul>
<li>of enforcement measures that can be taken if payments are not made voluntarily for example salary deductions by the employer, tax refund intercepts, garnishee of bank accounts</li>
<li>that Child Support will try all avenues of collection and to contact the agency immediately if they have any information about the payer that may assist with collection</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>amounts paid in recent months</li>
<li>what dates they were paid</li>
<li>how they were paid</li>
<li>to whom they were paid</li>
<li>in kind payments</li>
<li>what period was each payment made for (parent may consider the payments to be in advance or in arrears)</li>
<li>if the other party and the applicant had reconciled during the private collect period</li>
<li>if the payments were intended for child support</li></ul>
<p>Using the above information determine if the payments:</p>
<ul>
<li>have been more or less than the liability, and/or</li>
<li>have not, or have been paid by the date the parents agreed to</li></ul>
<p>Request evidence of any payments made especially if there is a dispute about the arrears.</p>
<p><strong>What are the circumstances behind payments being late or not paid at all?</strong></p>
<p>Ask for reasons that adequately explain late or part payments. Child Support are not obliged to accept subsequent AFCs if the payer has satisfactorily explained their failure to meet their obligation and rectified that failure. For examples, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 5.6.3: Reapplying for collection.</p>
<p><strong>Were any 'in kind' or 'third party' payments made in the private collect period?</strong></p>
<p>Any private payments for child support must be considered when determining amounts of unpaid child support. This not only consists of the direct payments from the payer to the payee but also any 'in kind' or 'third party' payments. Since these types of payments are not NAPs, the normal NAP requirement that customers intended the payment to be treated as child support do not apply. Payments that meet all the requirements of a 'prescribed' payment (under s71C) are also included. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for link to the Child Support Guide 5.1.4: Collection of arrears accrued during non-collect period.</p>
<p>For example, if the payer states a payment listed as a specified payment was paid and it meets all the requirements of s71C, allow the payer credit of up to 30% of the liability providing the remaining 70% of the liability was paid to the payee.</p></div>

<p>When Child Support is notified of a child support payment paid by the payer to the payee (or a third party) after the AFC is lodged, the payment, if accepted by Child Support, is taken into account by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>adjusting the opt in date to a future opt in date, or</li>
<li>considering the payment as a NAP</li></ul>
<p>The way in which the payment is recognised depends on the payment date and the date the liability becomes enforceable, that is, opt in date.</p>
<p>It is common for payers to continue to make private payments during a transition period of private collect to collect. A payee may state they never agreed this payment would be for child support. Ascertain if these payments were made in a similar way to previous payments made during, or specifically for, the private collect period. If this is the case, it can be presumed that both customers agreed that the payment was intended as child support unless the payee provides a credible reason to indicate otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting the opt in date to a future opt in date</strong></p>
<p>If the payment was made after the AFC was lodged and covered a specific period after the AFC lodgement date, adjust the opt in date to start the day after the payment period, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010370-01.html" target=_blank>Application for collection Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the opt in date cannot be more than 60 days from the AFC lodgement date. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for link to the Child Support Guide 5.1.3: Date a liability first becomes enforceable - Existing child support assessments section.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The AFC was lodged on 3 February and the arrears claimed are from 16 January. A payment was made 9 February for the period the 16 January to 15 February. A future opt in date will commence 16 February and the liability will be enforceable from this date.</p>
<p>In this example, if it was a subsequent AFC, a decision may also be needed whether or not to accept the application.</p>
<p><strong>Considering the payment as a NAP</strong></p>
<p>The following payment is considered a NAP where the payment/s is made after the AFC lodgement date and:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount paid is less than the claimed for arrears, or</li>
<li>the amount paid is more than the claimed for arrears but:</li>
<ul>
<li>the customers cannot agree on a specific period of time, and</li>
<li>a future opt in date cannot be determined</li></ul></ul>
<p>If accepted, these payments are processed in Cuba <strong>after</strong> the AFC has been accepted. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010420-03.html#bp03_L2GT_Create_a_NAP" target=_blank>Non-agency payment (NAP) Cuba Process Help</a>.

<p><strong>Overpayment</strong></p>
<p>Where an <a href="../separated-parents/277-04260000-01.html">overpayment</a> exists, advise the payer how it will affect the first and possible future payments. The payer has the option to:</p>

<p>Make sure the payer understands how payments and disbursements are managed. Highlight the importance of advising if they have difficulties making the payments in full and/or on time.</p>
<p><strong>Due dates for payments</strong></p>
<p>Cuba defaults to payments due by the 7th of each month for liability raised for the preceding month.</p>
<p>The first payment will be due by the 7th of the month following the first statement the payer receives. Thereafter it will depend on the payer's preferred payment period.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>An AFC is lodged on 27 September. The first statement will issue approximately 20 October which includes any opt in arrears, liability raised from 27 - 30 September and the full liability for October which is due and payable by 7 November. For further information on payment periods and due dates for payment by payers, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for a link to the Child Support Guide 5.1.5: Payment periods and payment of child support debts.</p>
<p>The payer may prefer to make manual payments with a different due date or a different frequency. Discuss <a href="../separated-parents/277-04280000-01.html">payment options for customers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Establish collection method</strong></p>
<p>During the discussion with the payer, it may be decided the AFC will be accepted based on the facts. If this occurs, review and discuss the following payment methods with the payer during the call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other existing collectable case</li>
<ul>
<li>When considering payment methods, if the payer has another collectable case check how those payments are being made and if there is outstanding debt. Review the case/s to check if the same payment arrangement and method will continue</li>
<li>If <a href="../separated-parents/277-04140000-01.html">Employer Withholding (EW)</a> has not been established check if a <strong>Stop Withholding</strong> indicator is active. If there is no <strong>Stop Withholding</strong> indicator, establish EW or take an <a href="../separated-parents/277-04150000-01.html">election for EW not to apply</a> </li></ul>
<li>When speaking with a customer about payment options, start the discussion by enquiring about their employment situation. If they are a salary and wage earner, advise that Child Support <strong>will</strong> collect Child Support payments via their employer</li>
<li>Collection of ongoing liability / debt</li>
<ul>
<li>Discuss if the opt in arrears, any other arrears and monthly child support are likely to be paid by the due date. If the arrears will not be paid in full, review or negotiate a new <a href="../separated-parents/277-04120000-01.html">debt repayment</a> arrangement </li>
<li>If the payers election to pay manually is accepted, go to the <a href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/CustomerPaymentReferenceNumberCalculator.html">Customer payment reference number calculator</a> macro to provide the payer their reference numbers and other details applicable to their preferred payment method so payments can be made before they are issued their first statement</li></ul></ul>
<p><strong>Explain apportionment where multiple cases exist</strong></p>
<p>If the payer owes child support to more than one payee and makes a payment for less than the total of the liabilities to each payee, the <a href="../separated-parents/277-06010000-01.html">payment will be apportioned</a> in proportion to the amount each payee is owed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> since 1 January 2007, payees have been able to privately enforce child support debts that are also collectible by us. If a court orders payments under these provisions, the normal apportionment rules may not apply. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> page for link to the Child Support Guide 5.4.7: Payee's right to enforce debt via court proceedings.</p></div>

<p>Using the information gathered make a decision on the AFC. This will depend on whether it is a first or subsequent application and/or whether the application meets the requirements of s39.</p>
<p>Child Support must accept a first time AFC made by a customer who was until recently the payee, including in circumstances where;</p>
<ul>
<li>roles have reversed</li>
<li>there has been a terminating event with arrears outstanding, or</li>
<li>an election to end the case with arrears outstanding </li></ul>
<p><strong>Role reversal example</strong>: Payee Adriana applies for a child support assessment and elects for private collection. Later her role reverses and Adriana becomes the payer. Adriana can request collection of unpaid amounts on the initial case where she was the payee. Adriana can opt in requesting 3 months arrears (or up to a maximum of 9 months in exceptional circumstances) before the date that case first becomes collectable. This is regardless of the ongoing liability in the case where Adriana is now the payer.</p>
<p>If the customer has requested arrears, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Formulate_calcu_Step02">go to Step 2</a>.</p>
<p>If the customer has not requested arrears, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04030000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Accept_refuse_Step03">Step 3 in Table 7</a></p>

<li>the specified period for which arrears are to be collected</li>
<li>the dates payments were made</li>
<li>amounts paid</li>
<li>who payments were made to (payee or third party)</li>
<li>how it was paid (cash, cheque, bank deposit)</li>
<li>when it was paid</li>
<li>what period the payment was intended to cover</li>
<li>the intention of the payment that is, whether both parties agree about the payment or regular payments to the third party</li>
<li>if the parties reconciled</li></ul>
<p>Customers should be encouraged to provide any evidence they have to support their claims. This evidence could be in the form of copies of receipts, statements, paid bills, statements from third parties who witnessed the payment etc.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the agency does not accept evidence from children.</p>
<p>Provide the customers with an appropriate time frame of 14 days which is usually sufficient to provide evidence. Allow for any reasonable circumstances which may delay provision of this information. Some remote locations for example may not have regular mail services and even a 14 day timeframe may not be sufficient for the customer to first obtain and then forward necessary evidence.</p></div>

<p>Even though the AFC might only apply to a 3 month opt in arrears period, valuable evidence could exist from an earlier date. For example, if payments have been made late every month in the 3 month arrears period which triggered the AFC, the past 12 months payment records might indicate a genuine misunderstanding on the payer's part about when the payments were due.</p>
<p>If a payment was made within the 3 or 9 months opt in arrears period, it is not a NAP but a payment which needs to be taken into account when calculating the amount of the opt-in arrears. This includes 'in kind', 'third party' and 'prescribed payments'.</p>
<p>Once the supporting information is gathered, decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>what period the arrears are for, for example, up to 3 or 9 months, and</li>
<li>what payments should be treated as child support for the period</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if the parents do not agree and the Registrar cannot be satisfied that payment was made for some or all of the arrears period being claimed, the arrears claim will be accepted. An exception may be where the payee has delayed the application for arrears to the extent that records about amounts paid are no longer available. In these cases, the Registrar may not be satisfied that amounts were unpaid and the arrears claim may not be successful.</p>
<p>If, while gathering evidence, false or conflicting information is provided or either party has provided false or misleading information, see <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html" target=_blank>Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption</a>.</p></div>

<p>The arrears auto-calculate once all the information has been keyed into Cuba. The date from which the arrears apply cannot be:</p>
<ul>
<li>more than 9 months before the Opt In date</li>
<li>before the date on which the case was last opted out, or</li>
<li>before the start date of liability</li></ul>
<p>The following illustrates how the arrears are calculated.</p>
<p>Arrears Amount = total liability for specified period less payments made.</p>
<p>(a) For whole months at a particular rate, the liability is:</p>
<p>(daily rate x 30.4375) x number of months</p>
<p>(b) For the days in a part month the liability is:</p>
<p>(daily rate x number of days)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the arrears period does not include the opt in date.</p>
<p>The final calculation of the opt-in arrears should be recorded as a new note as part of the original record in the Case Collection Details window.</p>
<p>Advise both customers how the amount of arrears was arrived at and the reasons for accepting or refusing any disputed payments. This is also a good opportunity to remind both customers if any unallocated NAP payments, excess NAP, excess discharge, cash overpayments and/or cash credits are on the account and how this will affect their payments/disbursements.</p>
<p>If there are no unpaid amounts for the private collect period when the payee applies for collection, the application for collection of arrears must be refused. However, if there is a retrospective variation to the liability after the acceptance of the AFC, this may mean amounts are now unpaid for the private collect period. If so, the payee may re-apply for collection of the unpaid amounts for the period 3 months (or up to 9 months in exceptional circumstances) before the case becoming collect, subject to the requirements of s28A or 39A.</p></div>
