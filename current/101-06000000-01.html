<p>A HCC can be used to obtain concessional medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). It also provides access to a limited range of State and Local Government health, household, educational, recreational and transport concessions.</p>

		<li>
receiving the maximum rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A as fortnightly instalments (or who would except for the Maintenance Income Test)</li>
		<li>
who would receive maximum FTB Part A except that they only have care of a Regular Care Child</li>
		<li>
who receive FTB for a foster child - card displays name of foster child only</li>
		<li>
receiving Carer Payment (CP) CP for short-term or episodic conditions</li>
		<li>
in receipt of certain income support payments for 52 weeks whose payments have been cancelled due to income will also qualify for an <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06020000-01.html">automatically issued HCC</a> for <strong>up to</strong> 26 weeks. The procedure <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06060030-01.html">Extended Entitlement to Concession Cards</a> contains further information</li>
		<li>
who are single principal carers on JobSeeker payments whose payment ceases because of a return to work will retain their Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) for 12 weeks and then be <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06060030-01.html">eligible for a HCC for a further 14 weeks</a></li>
		<li>
who are Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) wage participants receiving a CDEP Participant Supplement (CPS), where they qualify for a social security payment that attracts a HCC<strong>.

		</ul>
<p>A Carer Allowance (CA) child may also qualify for a HCC if the carer does not qualify for a Carer Allowance payment. The carer must complete a Claim for Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance - Caring for a child - under 16 years (SA337) and have the treating doctor complete a Treating Doctor's Report (SA333tdr).

<p>A LIC is a HCC for which a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040010-03.html">claim is required.</a></p>

<p>A LIC can be used to obtain concessional medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

Customers will need to follow up what concessions are available with the concession provider.</p>

<p>This card can be claimed by&#58;</p>

customers&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
not receiving social security payments who are low income earners</li>

who receive less than the maximum Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A</li>

who are not claiming FTB by instalments</li>
			<li>
who are not an FTB child aged over 16 years</li>		</ul>
		<li>
full-time students or Australian apprentices receiving ABSTUDY, Austudy or Youth Allowance (YA)</li>
		<li>
young dependent people who are not entitled to payments as their parental means test is too high</li>
		<li>
children who do not meet the definition of an FTB child and are not considered to be a dependent of an adult. The child may be in formal or informal foster care, a ward of the state, in State/Territory government care or in approved care</li>

<p>Service Officers may backdate a LIC start date to a date of medical service or treatment rendered to the customer or an eligible participant up to 40 weeks before the claims was lodged provided the customer was qualified for the entire period. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040000-01.html">Low Income Health Care Card (LIC)</a> for more information.</p>

customers who receive a social security pension</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers aged over 60, who have been in continuous receipt of one of these payments or a social security pension for at least 39 weeks immediately before a benefit transfer to another of these payments, will retain their entitlement to the PCC.</p>

<p>Customers who <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06050000-01.html">qualify for a PCC</a> are entitled to additional concessions from Federal, State and Local Government authorities and some private organisations.

<p>This card may entitle cardholders to State or Local Government concessions but these may vary from State to State and cardholders need to check with the relevant State or Local government authority.

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Person_named_on_card">Person named on card is unable to sign</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There may be situations where the person named on the card is unable to sign it. For example, the customer may be unable to sign because of a disability, or they may be a child who has not yet developed a signature, etc.</p>

<p>Social Security law does not require that a concession card be signed. A signature is only one method of determining that the person using a concession card is the person entitled to use it. This can be established by identification methods other than a signature.</p>

<p>A person is not required to have any particular mental capacity to sign a concession card. The appropriate person to sign may vary depending on the circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if a child is old enough to write their name on the card <strong>and</strong> is able to identically reproduce this signature upon request, then it may be appropriate for the child to sign the card</li>
		<li>
if a person is not able to sign the card, then any person with legal guardianship is able to sign the card on the child's behalf. This includes nominees. The guardian/nominee should indicate in the signature block that they are signing on another person's behalf</li>
		<li>
many adults are unable to read or write and it is a long established principle that an 'X' placed on a document by such a person constitutes their signature for legal purposes</li>
		</ul>
<p>It should be noted that the agency only provides the concession cards through Centrelink, <strong>not</strong> the concessions. It is ultimately the concession provider who determines whether to accept a concession card which has not been signed by the person named on it.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Income support customers</strong></p>

<p>Concession entitlement for the customer ceases on the day before date of death, as the day the customer passes away is considered part of the bereavement period.</p>

<p>Executors/family members who contact Services Australia regarding organisations (that is hospitals or pharmacies) charging full price for services received on the date of death, should be advised that they will need to discuss this with the service concerned.</p>

<p><strong>Concession card only customers</strong></p>

<p>Customers issued with the following concession cards from Services Australia, will also have their concession entitlement cease on the day before date of death&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)</li>
		<li>
Low Income Health Care Card (LIC)</li>
		<li>
Foster Child Health Care Card (FST)</li>
		<li>
Ex-Carer Allowance (child) Health Care Card (EHC)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When a CSHC customer advises of the death of their partner, a review should be initiated to ensure the customer is still qualified for CSHC or if the customer may have entitlement to an income support payment. There is no system produced review for this and Service Officers need to manually follow up the details with the customer either by phone or via mail. Customers should be given 21 days to respond.</p>

<p><strong>Care receiver</strong></p>

<p>When a <a href="../carers/009-03090010-01.html">Carer Payment care receiver dies</a> and the carer is entitled to continuation of Carer Payment (CP) during the bereavement period, entitlement to PCC also continues.</p>

<p>If a customer was receiving CP to care for a child with a short-term or episodic condition and the child dies, the customer retains entitlement to their HCC and CP during the bereavement period, regardless of the medical report end date.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the card applied for is lower in the card hierarchy than any existing concession card, the new card will not be issued automatically by the system.</p>

<p>Customers are not automatically issued a new concession card when transferring from one payment to another and retain entitlement to the same type of concession card. For example, when a customer transfers from Disability Support Pension (DSP) to Age Pension. As the customer was entitled to a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) whilst on DSP, a new card will not be issued to the customer unless the customer requests a new card.</p>

<p>Any new card issued after the transfer activity is processed will display an abbreviated code to reflect the primary payment current at the time of issue. This includes the reissued card which is sent one month before the expiry date of the current card.</p>

<p>An <strong>exception</strong> to this is if a customer is transferring from the standard pension to Blind Pension. A new card will be issued due to the physical appearance of the card being slightly different.</p>

<p>It allows customers to present their concession card using their smart device. It is at the discretion of the concession provider whether they accept the digital card so it is important that customers have their physical card with them.
