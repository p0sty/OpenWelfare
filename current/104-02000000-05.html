<p><strong>Overview</strong></p></td>
<td>

<p>These guidelines provide support for the application of the Customer Complaint and Feedback Policy and detail the major aspects of receiving, assessing, managing and finalising complaints and feedback.</p>

<p>Complaints and feedback are everyone's responsibility, and everyone within the agency is authorised to finalise them. Any staff member receiving a complaint should try to finalise it at the first point of contact. If the complaint cannot be immediately finalised, staff should retain ownership of the complaint until it is either finalised or further escalated to Level 2. This includes if assistance is required from senior staff or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).</p>

<p>Complaints, compliments and suggestions lodged via the agency's official complaints and feedback channels will be received by staff with a skill-set in complaints and feedback handling in each of the service delivery brands.</p>

<p>The agency's Multicultural and Tailored Services Branch is responsible for all policy and procedures related to customer complaints and feedback, and the management of all Level 2 complaints.</p>

<p>Complaints alleging unauthorised access and/or disclosure of information or internal fraud will be referred to the Internal Fraud Control and Investigations Branch. Complaints alleging customer fraud will be referred to the Serious Non-Compliance Branch. The allegations will then be managed under the fraud investigation procedures for these Branches.</p>

<p>Where a complaint is considered urgent or high profile it may need to be escalated to the Secretary, Executive and Minister's Office. This escalation will occur within the Level 2 Complaints Team in accordance with the agency's Escalation Coordination Policy. See the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Escalation Coordination Team</a> homepage for information about the policy.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving a complaint, compliment or suggestion</strong></p></td>
<td>
		<ul>		<li>
Using the definitions contained within this policy, staff are expected to determine whether the customer is making a complaint or general enquiry, or providing a compliment or suggestion</li>
		<li>
In making a determination, staff should also consider the following criteria to assess whether a customer is making a complaint or a general enquiry&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The manner in which the customer communicates or expresses the issue/s,</li>
			<li>
The urgency of the issue/s raised,</li>
			<li>
The potential or actual impact of the identified issue/s on the customer, and</li>
			<li>
Prior or ongoing attempts at resolution through regular business processes</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Customers are entitled to make complaints or provide feedback anonymously. Staff will not record identifying details of customers who wish to remain anonymous. Where possible staff will confirm with the customer if and how they want to be advised of the complaint outcome. Customers who lodge anonymous complaints will be advised that it may be difficult to conduct a full investigation without knowing the identity of a complainant</li>
		<li>
Staff will be alert and flexible to the needs of vulnerable customers. This includes allowing authorised third parties to make complaints and act on behalf of others</li>
		<li>
All compliments and suggestions provided to the agency via phone or in person should be acknowledged by the staff member who receives them and the customer informed their feedback will be shared with the relevant staff and business owners. Compliments and suggestions provided online are acknowledged at the time of lodgement. Compliments and suggestions provided online or in writing from customers will be shared with relevant staff and business owners</li>
		<li>
When a complainant expresses intent to go approach the media about their complaint, staff must alert the agency's media section. If the customer advises they have been to the media the case should be escalated to specialist complaints staff</li>
		<li>
Customers who provide complaints and suggestions via the agency's social media channels will be responded to and encouraged to provide details so we can provide a tailored response to finalise their complaint. In the absence of personal details, a social media complainant will be provided with a general response</li>
		<li>
If a complaint is provided to the agency via phone or in person, staff are expected to acknowledge receipt of the complaint during the initial contact and attempt to finalise it</li>
		<li>
If a complaint is received via a written or an online channel, including social media, where automatic acknowledgement is not available, the staff member who receives the complaint must contact the customer to acknowledge receipt of the complaint within five working days and attempt to finalise it</li>
		<li>
During any initial contact with a customer, including when the customer first provides their complaint or feedback, staff are expected to manage the customer's expectations. This includes providing details about the complaints and feedback management process, timeframes for investigating a complaint, asking about the remedy the customer is seeking and advising what can and cannot be done</li>
		<li>
Staff should take the time to record all complaints and feedback as a method of highlighting weakness and improving service to customers. All customer complaints and feedback must be recorded in the agency's central database for customer feedback</li>		</ul>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Services_Austra_Complain"></a>
<p><strong>Complaint assessment</strong></p></td>
<td>
		<ul>		<li>
Staff should take a holistic approach to complaint assessment and consider the complainant's issues as well as any other relevant concerns the staff member identifies. This includes any issues that have not been identified by the customer but could impact on or contribute to their dissatisfaction</li>
		<li>
Staff will assess complaints for priority or complexity by referring to the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-05.html#bp05_tbl_01_Escalati">complaint escalation reasons</a>, and then decide whether the complaint can be finalised at first contact or if it needs to be escalated to a specialist Complaints Officer (for contact details, see Warm transfer customers to Level 2 - Escalated Complaints and Feedback team in Complaints). Staff should also assess if complaint issues require investigation after the first contact, and manage the customer's expectations regarding what will happen and when</li>
		<li>
Any complaints originating from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Minister, Members of Parliament, directed to the agency's Executive branch, should be escalated for management by specialist complaints staff</li>
		<li>
If a complaint is about the age, gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or any other personal characteristic (perceived or known) of agency staff, staff must treat it with sensitivity and with regard to anti-discrimination principles</li>
		<li>
Complaints about the actions, management, or conduct of a staff member handling a complaint must be escalated for independent investigation. If the complaint is about a staff member the complaint should be escalated to the staff member's manager or a specialist complaints staff member</li>		</ul>

When a complaint cannot be finalised at the first point of contact, staff should document what needs to be done to finalise the complaint. This includes, but is not limited to, the issue to be investigated, any steps involved, whether more information is required, the remedy the customer is seeking, and any special considerations</li>
		<li>
Staff must document all details of their plans for investigation on the complaint record in the agency's central customer feedback database including any commitments provided to customers</li>

Staff must treat a complaint on its merits and undertake an investigation proportionate to the assessment of the complaint and the severity of the issues presented</li>
		<li>
Staff should use all resources available to them in an attempt to finalise a customer's complaint. This includes reference material and assistance from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and/or a Team Leader</li>
		<li>
During an investigation, staff should contact a complainant to update them about the progress and status of their complaint, where additional information is required, or when adverse or conflicting information is presented</li>

<p><strong>Response</strong></p></td>
<td>
		<ul>		<li>
Staff should inform complainants of any findings in relation to the issues raised in a complaint and advise when a complaint is finalised. This advice should be provided in accordance with agency guidelines on disclosure of information. See the link to details on disclosure of information on the <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-02000000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Services_Austra01">Your right to privacy website</a> page</li>
		<li>
Staff should tailor responses to meet the needs of individual complainants, and offer a remedy to complaint issues that is appropriate in the circumstances</li>
		<li>
In instances where a mistake is made, or service standards are not met, staff should offer an apology</li>
		<li>
Staff should clearly explain any remedies provided or offered to the customer, including information or an apology. If no remedy is appropriate or available, the staff member will explain this to the customer</li>
		<li>
If a customer remains dissatisfied with the response or the remedy provided or offered to finalise their complaint, staff should advise them of their further escalation options within the agency and external such as the Commonwealth Ombudsman. For contact details, see Warm transfer customers to Level 2 - Escalated Complaints and Feedback team in Complaints</li>
		<li>
Complaints about the actions, management, or conduct of a staff member handling a complaint should be escalated to specialist complaints staff or the staff member's manager if the initial response does not resolve the complaint. Customers should be informed that we cannot advise them of the outcome of these investigations but that we value feedback provided by customers</li>		</ul>

		<li>
Staff will record information about complaints and feedback in a centralised database for customer feedback. Reports from this database will be provided to business owners to enable them to identify complaint trends, consider suggestions, and review all compliments</li>
		<li>
When there is evidence that a service or policy affecting a customer could be improved as the result of a complaint, the person managing the complaint should provide constructive and respectful feedback about the issues identified to increase individual and organisational capability and improve customer service</li>		</ul>
