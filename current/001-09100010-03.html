<p>These job seekers are <strong>not</strong> Centrelink managed and <strong>must</strong> be referred to a Provider. Once referred, they will display as Provider managed.</p>

<p><strong>Provider managed</strong></p>

<p>The provider or Online Services will negotiate the Job Plan. For new claim job seekers this will usually occur at the initial interview with their provider or Online Services. Refer the job seeker back to their provider or Online Services. Procedure ends here.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for Online Services job seekers, the Job Plan will only be presented to them once they complete the Career Profile, unless exempt from RapidConnect.</p>

Restate the job seeker's <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a></li>
