<p><strong>Q999 - Text to be used where the enter care date differs from date provided in pre-birth claim.</strong></p>

<p>'I refer to your request to transfer your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to &lt;name of secondary claimant&gt;. We were recently advised that this transfer should start on &lt;start date from post birth claim&gt;. This date is different from the date that you have previously advised.</p>

<p>In order to confirm the correct date to transfer your Parental Leave Pay entitlement, please contact us on 136 150 by &lt;due date for contact&gt;. If you do not contact us, Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for &lt;child's name&gt;.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 - Secondary claimant applying for PPL when primary claimant has not applied for PPL and is transferring some or all of their PPL entitlement</strong></p>

<p>'In your claim you indicated that you are claiming Paid Parental Leave because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;someone&gt; is transferring some or all their entitlement to you. Before we can assess your entitlement to Parental Leave Pay, the initial primary carer (that is, the birth mother), must lodge a claim and establish their eligibility to Parental Leave Pay. If they have returned to work before lodging their claim for Paid Parental Leave, it is essential you both lodge your claims at the same time.</p>

<p>If &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; does not submit a claim within 14 days of this notice being issued, Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for &lt;child's name&gt;'.</p>

<p><strong>Q999 - Invite primary and/or secondary claimant to lodge PPL claim when the primary claimant is transferring their full/partial PPL entitlement</strong></p>

<p>'We are writing to invite you to claim Parental Leave Pay for &lt;child's name&gt;. You can lodge your claim by either accessing your Centrelink online account through myGov and selecting 'Make a claim' or if you are unable to use our online services, contact us on 136150. You must lodge your claim within 14 days of this notice being issued or Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for &lt;child's name&gt;.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 NEF text to secondary claimant - Primary claimant did not submit an effective PPL claim</strong></p>

<p>'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; has not submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for &lt;child's name&gt; you will need to contact us once &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; has submitted their claim.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 NEF text to primary claimant - Secondary claimant did not submit an effective PPL claim</strong></p>

<p>'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to&gt; has not submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for &lt;child's name &gt; you will need to contact us once &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to &gt; has submitted their claim.'</p>

<p>Fiona does not give permission for Phillip to claim any Flexible PPL days as Fiona intends to claim these later. Fiona's overall PPL claim remains open (OPN) pending the Flexible PPL days (PPL/CZR-FLX).</p>

<p>Fiona meets all PPL eligibility criteria for each date from their child's date of birth, up to and including 19 July (the day before Fiona returned to work).

<p><strong>Transfer full PPL period to secondary claimant from a date after the child's birth - secondary claimant only has claimed</strong></p>

<p>Lisa had a baby on 20 September. Partner Brad lodges a claim for PPL 4 weeks later.</p>

<p>In the PPL claim, Brad advises of claiming PPL because Lisa is transferring the payment to him. Before assessing Brad's claim, a Q999 is sent in <strong>Customer First</strong> advising Brad that Lisa must submit a claim for PPL within 14 days before Brad's entitlement to PPL can be assessed. A Q999 is also sent to Lisa in <strong>Customer First</strong> advising to lodge a claim within 14 days.</p>

<p>On 2 November Lisa lodges a claim for PPL, and in the claim indicates that Lisa has returned to work and transferred primary care of their child to Brad on 16 October. Lisa also advises of the intention to transfer the full PPL period to Brad from 16 October.</p>

<p>As the primary claimant's claim must be assessed before the secondary claimant's claim, the Service Officer assesses Lisa's claim first and establishes Lisa meets the relevant PPL eligibility criteria from their child's date of birth, up to and including 15 October (the day before Lisa returned to work). Lisa's PPL period is finalised with a '<strong>REJ</strong>'ection code of '<strong>TFR</strong>'.</p>

<p>Lisa does not give permission for Brad to claim any Flexible PPL days as Lisa intends to claim these later. Lisa's overall PPL claim remains open (OPN) pending the Flexible PPL days (PPL/CZR-FLX).</p>

<p><strong>Permission to claim Flexible PPL days revoked (for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2020)</strong></p>

<p>Angie had a baby on 15 January and submits a claim for PPL 1 week later. In the claim, Angie claims the PPL period and 20 Flexible PPL days. Angie also gives permission for another person to claim the other 10 Flexible PPL days. </p>

<p>Angie meets all eligibility requirements and the PPL period assessed from 15 January.</p>

<p>On 20 March Angie’s partner Jake submits an effective claim for PPL and claims the 10 Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>On 1 May Angie contacts Services Australia. Angie now wants to claim the 10 days and does not want Jake to receive them.</p>

<p>There are no available Flexible PPL days because Angie has claimed 20 days and Jake has claimed 10. Angie can only revoke permission to claim Flexible PPL days that have not been claimed by another person. As Jake’s Flexible PPL days have not been paid, Jake can withdraw them. This will add them back to the balance of available days for Angie to claim.</p>

<p>Had Jake's Flexible days been paid already they would not be able to be withdrawn.</p></td>

<p><strong>PPL transfer details changed after PPL has been granted</strong></p>

<p>Liz lodged an effective claim for PPL on 5 May for Liz's newborn child born 1 March. Liz requested the PPL period commence on 1 August and advised the PLP entitlement would not be transferred to another person. </p>

<p>On 15 June Liz contacts and advises they are returning to work on 30 July and would like to transfer the PPL period only to partner, John. The Service Officer updates Liz’s payment choice using the <strong>PPL Circumstance</strong> guided procedure (Child leave primary care). They tell Liz that John needs to submit an effective claim and be assessed as eligible before they can receive any PPL entitlement. </p>

<p>The Service Officer also tells Liz to review the claimed Flexible PPL days to prevent any incorrect payments.</p></td>
