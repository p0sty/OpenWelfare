			<ul>			<li>
Partnered and separating temporarily (that is, going into temporary accommodation)</li>
			<li>
Partnered and separating permanently (that is, relationship has broken down)</li>
			<li>
Assessed as SUOR and is no longer sharing with their former partner. The '<strong>SUR</strong>' qualifier code must be ended on the <strong>MS</strong> screen. See the Process page of <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-01.html">Member of a Couple (MoC) and Separated under one roof (SUOR) assessments</a> for information on how to end the '<strong>SUR</strong>' qualifier code</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For customers receiving a social security benefit, social security pension, ABSTUDY and/or Family Tax Benefit (FTB), code the <strong>AC</strong> screen regardless of whether the customer is paying for accommodation or not. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092646-01.html">Completing the Accommodation Details (AC) screen and assessing Rent Assistance (RA)</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Exceptions&#58;</strong> No <strong>AC</strong> screen updates are required where&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a student with a term addresses ('<strong>TER</strong>') contacts to advise a change in parental home details only, or</li>
			<li>
a customer has moved into a temporary address ('<strong>TEM</strong>') and the reason the customer has moved does not entitle them to receive RA for their temporary accommodation. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03030030-01.html">Temporary accommodation and Rent Assistance (RA)</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Corrections to records, street name, number, etc.</li>
		<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> for Special Benefit (SpB) customers receiving free board and/or lodgings - code the <strong>Type of Rent&#58;</strong> field with one of the following&#58; '<strong>FBL</strong>' (free board and lodging), '<strong>FBD</strong>' (free board), or '<strong>FLD</strong>' (free lodging), to allow the system to calculate the correct rate of payment</li>
		<li>
If <strong>rent</strong> is or was being paid, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092646-01.html">Completing the Accommodation Details (AC) screen and assessing Rent Assistance (RA)</a></li>

When updating the address details for an ABSTUDY or Youth Allowance (YA) customer (students only) who is temporarily not living at their permanent home, update&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the <strong>Address Type&#58;</strong> field as '<strong>TER</strong>' (Term Address Type) on the <strong>AD</strong> and <strong>AC</strong> screens with the temporary away from home address</li>
			<li>
their phone number at the address where they are living while studying/looking for work/ new apprentice as a Contact number '<strong>CON</strong>' on the <strong>TD</strong> screen</li>
			<li>
this will leave the permanent home details (usually the parents' details) as the home address</li>
			<li>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a YA customer <strong>permanently</strong> moves away from the parental home then the place of the new residence is to be coded as '<strong>HOM</strong>'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Updating the Regional Location Details (<strong>RLD</strong>) screen when the parental home changes. YA and ABSTUDY customers who are full-time students in an approved scholarship course may also be eligible to receive Relocation Scholarship. For details on coding the <strong>RLD</strong> screen, see <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030010-03.html">Relocation Scholarship (RS) payment and coding</a></li>
		<li>
When a YA or ABSTUDY customer permanently moves away from the parental home then the place of the new residence is to be coded as '<strong>HOM</strong>'</li>
		<li>

<strong>Family assistance</strong> customers who are renting should be advised to provide verification even if their income estimate is currently too high to receive RA. This is to ensure that, after the <a href="../families/007-11010000-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation process<i></a> </i>occurs at the end of the financial year, they receive arrears of any possible RA entitlement they may have in their top up payment</li>
		<li>
If the customer has other addresses recorded on their Address History (<strong>ADH</strong>) screen, check if other addresses require updates. If so, go back to the top of this step</li>
		<li>
If a customer advises of a future address change occurring within the next 14 days it can be updated to their record. They must be advised of what affect this will have on where any correspondence sent via Australia Post is sent. </li>
			<ul>			<li>

<p>When updating a YA or ABSTUDY customer's change of address update the <strong>AC</strong> screen and, where appropriate, the Independent/Homeless/Away From Home Details (<strong>NIH</strong>) screen. This is essential to ensure the correct rate of payment is paid to the customer.</p>

<p>Check the following to ensure correct rate of pay (for example, at home or the away from home rate) is being made to customer.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For a customer <strong>moving out of the parental home</strong>, see</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02060000-01.html">Away from home rate for ABSTUDY</a></li>
			<li>
<a href="../job-seekers/001-04040000-01.html">The away from home rate for Youth Allowance (YA) customers</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
For a customer <strong>returning to the parental home</strong>, see</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010130-01.html">Returning to the parental home when in receipt of the away from home rate of ABSTUDY</a></li>
			<li>
<a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010120-01.html">Returning to the parental home when independent or qualified for the away from home rate of Youth Allowance (YA)</a></li>
			<li>

			<li>

			<li>
<a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08080010-01.html">Qualification for the payment of Rent Assistance (RA)</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who are independent under State Care, unreasonable to live at home and disadvantaged will generally lose qualification to independent status if they move to the home of a parent.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For customers <strong>moving from one parent's home to live with another</strong> parent, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02020000-01.html">Changes which may affect the Parental Income Test (PIT)</a></li>
		<li>
For customers who are full-time students and receiving the away from home rate advising a change to their parental home address, the Regional Location Details (<strong>RLD</strong>) screen may also need updating, updating the <strong>RLD</strong> screen when the parental home changes. For details on coding the <strong>RLD</strong> screen, see <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030010-03.html">Relocation Scholarship (RS) payment and coding</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>YA and ABSTUDY customers who are full-time students in an approved scholarship course may also be receiving Relocation Scholarship.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For <strong>independent customers</strong>, consider whether they are an accommodated independent person. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-04040000-01.html">The away from home rate for Youth Allowance (YA) customers</a></li>
		<li>
For <strong>independent ABSTUDY</strong> customers, review their circumstances to identify any issues associated with independence, such as homelessness. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-07020020-01.html">Reviews of independence for ABSTUDY</a></li>
		<li>
If the customer also <strong>changed school/education institution</strong>, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-07020010-01.html">Changing or correcting course of study for Youth Allowance, Austudy and Pensioner Education Supplement students</a></li>

A review must be carried out if either the carer or care receiver notifies of a change of address, to ensure the constant care or supervision criteria are still being met. See <a href="../carers/009-03070020-01.html">Change of address for Carer Payment (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA)</a> for more information</li>
		<li>
For CP, if the carer and care receiver are living in different homes, the time involved for the carer in travelling between the 2 homes, the level of care provided and the accessibility of the carer to the care receiver must be considered</li>
		<li>
For CA, in general, the carer and care receiver must reside together, unless certain exceptions are met. Check if the specific <a href="../carers/009-03070020-01.html">qualification criteria are still met</a></li>
