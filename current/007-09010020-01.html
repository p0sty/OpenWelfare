<p>For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023, if an employer determination is made, the employer will be responsible for the delivery of PPL when the customer nominated:</p>
<ul>
<li>an 8 week (40 consecutive weekdays) minimum block of continuous PPL days (Monday to Friday only), <strong>and </strong></li>
<li>the PPL days fall before the child turns one/anniversary of care</li></ul>
<p>The employer determination only applies to the first block of PPL days since birth/entry to care.</p>
<p>Services Australia will deliver:</p>

<p>All other Flexible PPL days will be delivered by Services Australia, regardless of the employer determination outcome. Employers cannot elect to deliver these days.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> connected Flexible PPL days cannot be paid more than 52 weeks after the child’s birth or adoption. Any connected Flexible PPL days scheduled after the child’s first birthday or anniversary of adoption will not be:</p>

<h2 id=bp01_L2GT_Employer_determ>Employer determinations for PPL</h2>
<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>The employer will be responsible for delivery of PPL to an eligible employee who:</p>
<ul>
<li>has been an employee of the employer for 12 months or more immediately prior to the child's expected date of birth or entry into care (for Australian Public Service (APS) employees, the employment period is covered by all APS employment)</li>
<li>will be an employee of the employer for the employer paid period</li>
<li>is an Australian-based employee of the employer</li>
<li>is expecting to receive 8 weeks or more of PPL, and</li>
<li>is not in receipt of an income support payment (ISP)</li></ul>
<p>The employer must also have an Australian Business Number (ABN).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for APS employees, if the employee has worked for the APS (rather than their particular agency or agency) for more than 12 months, then an employer determination would be made by their current employer.</p>
<p>If the customer is an eligible employee, they will <strong>not</strong> have the option to choose who will deliver the payment. This includes employees who are full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers. <strong>Exception:</strong> if a child is stillborn or has died, a PPL employee should be given the choice of payment delivery by the agency or their employer (this includes when PPL might have already started).</p>
<p>The employer obligation to accept a PPL employer determination is not removed, where a person:</p>
<ul>
<li>is casually employed, or </li>
<li>does not have a shift scheduled during their employer delivered period, </li>
<li>is usually employed on a temporary contract and intends to return to work with the same employer, or </li>
<li>is not on the current payroll</li></ul>
<p>Staff will need to undertake discussions with the employee and the employer to obtain evidence and an understanding of the employee’s work history and pattern of employment to assist them determine whether the employer is obligated to deliver PPL to them.</p>
<p>The <a href="../families/007-09010020-05.html">Resources</a> page has a matrix to determine whether a customer meets the requirements to have either a mandatory or opt-in PPL employer determination made for their claim. This depends:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the details that they have provided in their claim, and </li>
<li>the class of employees that their employer has opted in for</li></ul>
<p>If the employer is <strong>not</strong> responsible for providing PPL to the employee, it will be delivered by the agency. However, employers can <strong>elect</strong> to provide PPL for all full-time, part-time, permanent and casual employees, regardless of how long they have been working for the employer. The agency <strong>must</strong> obtain the consent from the employee before making an employer determination. </p>
<p>Employers must register their details with the agency using Provider Digital Access (PRODA) to access the Business Hub, then opt in to provide Parental Leave Pay <strong>before</strong> their employee submits their claim. For more details see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-02040010-01.html" target=_blank>Employer registration for PPL</a>.</p>
<p>Changes to employer circumstances resulting in revocation/transfer of the employer role will be actioned by the Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team (PPLEPT).</p></div></div></div>

<h2 id=bp01_L2GT_Employers_as_pa>Employers as payment nominees</h2>
<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>If a PPL employee's PPL is to be delivered by the agency, requests to appoint their employer as their payment nominee the associated risks for PPL customers using employers as payment nominees should be brought to their attention.</p>
<p>Service Officers should make employees aware of their entitlement to specify an end date for nominee arrangements.</p>
<p>Although the employee's employer may not be legally required to provide the employee's PPL, they may elect to do so and the employee should be encouraged to discuss this option with their employer.</p></div></div></div>
<p></p>
<div class=twisty><a name=bp01_L2GT_PPL_provided_by class=anchor></a>
<h2 id=bp01_L2GT_PPL_provided_by>PPL provided by the employer</h2>
<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>PPL funds will be delivered in advance to the employer, who will then provide PPL to the employee through their existing payroll cycle. Employers can elect to receive funding fortnightly or they may opt to receive funds 6-weekly in 3 instalments. This will display on the Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screen of the employee as 6WE (6-weekly).</p>
<p>Where the employer selects irregular/other as their pay cycle frequency, the employer will not be able to input pay cycle dates and funding will only be delivered in 6 weekly instalments.</p>
<p>It is important to note that payments from an employer will be aligned to the employer's payroll cycle. This means any PPL delivery information on an employee's record will reflect when payment was made to the employer, <strong>not</strong> when payment was delivered from the employer to the employee.</p>
<p>The first payment will not be provided to the employer unless the employee is PPL/CUR on the relevant strip date. The employer pay strip date is 2 working days before the employer pay delivery date.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> as employer payments are sent 7 days before the employer's pay cut off it is not unusual for some time to elapse between the claim being granted and the first payment to the employer being issued.</p>
<p>Employers are required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide back pay of PPL in the next available regular payday and withhold tax from the back pay under the usual Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding arrangements</li>
<li>pay PPL to their employee as part of their usual payroll cycle</li>
<li>provide the employee with a written record of the payment and any deductions (payslip)</li>
<li>withhold tax from the PPL under the usual PAYG withholding arrangements, and</li>
<li>include PPL in the total amounts on the employee's annual or part-year payment summary (statements produced and given to the employee for tax purposes)</li></ul>
<p>Letters are issued to the employer to advise them when an employer determination has been made for them to provide PPL to an employee, as well any changes to the determination.</p>
<p>It is not possible to issue urgent payments to employers or transfer the provider role to the agency because a payment is yet to be provided to the employee. The employer has no obligation under the scheme to provide payments at any time, other than the regular payday and once sufficient funds have been received by the agency.</p></div></div></div>

<h2 id=bp01_L2GT_PPL_provided_by01>PPL provided by Services Australia</h2>
<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>The agency will provide PPL to an employee, at commencement or during the PPL payment period, when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the conditions for an employer determination are not met, or</li>
<li>the employee is receiving an income support payment and claims PPL for a child born or entering care</li></ul>
<p>The agency may decide not to make an employer determination where the:</p>
<ul>
<li>child in respect of whom PPL is payable is stillborn or has died</li>
<li>employer does not have an Australian Business Number (ABN). For example, people who are not in a business and employ household workers such as cleaners, nannies or gardeners. In these cases, there is no requirement for the employer to have an ABN</li>
<li>employer does not have an Australian bank account</li>
<li>employer is not a fit and proper person</li></ul>
<p>PPL will also be delivered directly to the customer if they are an independent contractor, or self-employed with no additional employees.</p>
<ul>
<li>For children born or adopted before 1 July 2023:</li>
<ul>
<li>customer is a tertiary claimant</li>
<li>customer's PPL period has ended</li>
<li>primary claimant owes a debt in relation to an instalment paid in relation to a child and the customer is a secondary claimant for the same child</li>
<li>any Flexible PPL days that are not connected to the PPL period</li></ul>
<li>For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023</li>
<ul>
<li>where a customer has claimed a day on the weekend (ie: Saturday or Sunday)</li>
<li>any subsequent PPL days, including periods of 8 weeks or longer that are separated from the first period</li>
<li>where the customer is already current and a day or more is added before the continuous block and the new day(s) are not a continuous block of at least 8 weeks of consecutive weekdays</li></ul></ul>
<p>In these cases the agency will:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay PPL as fortnightly instalments to the customer into their nominated Australian bank account</li>
<li>withhold tax at a rate of 15% unless the customer specifies another amount</li>
<li>pay PPL to a nominee if requested by the customer (<strong>Note:</strong> when a customer has or requests a payment nominee, it may indicate the customer is not able to provide enough care for the child to meet <a href="../families/007-09020010-03.html">PPL eligibility</a>. If the customer is unable to provide this care it may be more appropriate for another person to claim PLP for the child)</li></ul></div></div></div>

<ul>
<li>an additional block consisting of a minimum 40 consecutive weekdays is claimed prior to the existing employer paid block period, and </li>

<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>If an employee is receiving an ISP at the time of the initial PPL claim determination (including where the ISP will cancel due to PPL payments) and the PPL claim is for a child that is born or entering care, the agency will be the PPL paymaster. No employer determination will be made.</p>
<p>Employees already in receipt of PPL that have had an employer determination made (either the PPL payment has commenced or has been scheduled to commence) and who are granted an ISP will have the paymaster role automatically transferred from the employer to the agency. The date of effect for the transfer will be the PPL date paid to + 1 day to ensure there is no overpayment raised against the employer.</p>
<p>Once the agency has been appointed as the paymaster, future reassessments will not change the paymaster, unless the employee makes a subsequent request to change the paymaster role <strong>and</strong> the employee is no longer receiving an ISP.</p>
<p>This automatic paymaster role transfer does <strong>not</strong> apply where an ISP is granted to the PPL employee’s partner. It only applies if the PPL employee themselves are granted an ISP.</p></div></div></div>

<h2 id=bp01_L2GT_Delivery_of_PPL01>Delivery of PPL over national public holidays</h2>
<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>Holiday processing arrangements apply to the delivery of PPL where employer delivery dates are impacted by a national public holiday.</p>
<p>The revised date of payment delivery is based on the employer's 'regular pay cut off date' and will generally be delivered a couple of days earlier than the usual delivery date in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Employers have an obligation to pay PPL to their employees when they are funded to do so and to provide PPL in line with their employee's normal pay cycle. If an employer fails to comply with these responsibilities normal <a href="../families/007-13030010-01.html" target=_blank>dispute resolution procedures apply</a>.</p></div></div></div>

<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>If it is known that an employer has shut down for a period of time (for example, Christmas shutdown period)<strong> and</strong> there is the possibility of a delay in the employer acceptance process, which will cause a delay in payment to the employee, it may be appropriate to revoke the employer determination and transfer PPL payment responsibility.</p>
<p>An employer is not expected to commence payments to the employee prior to receiving funding from the agency however, there is nothing to stop them from doing so. Employers are only required to pay an instalment to an employee if an employer determination has been made and they have received funds from the agency.</p></div></div></div>

<div class=collapsible_container>
<div class=block>
<p>If a third party receives a payment or payments they are not entitled to, they are responsible for repaying this amount. This includes when payment(s) have been incorrectly credited to a third party’s account, including a joint account.</p>
<p>Care must be taken if the payment was directed to an account nominated by the employee and the employee does not have legal access to. A refund should only be requested if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the employee made a genuine error when notifying the account details</li>
<li>the account details were changed without the authority of the employee, or</li>
<li>there was an agency error</li></ul>
<p>If payments have been incorrectly credited to a third party’s account, a request for refund is made under section 1234AA of the Social Security Act 1991, section 93A of the Family Assistance Administration Act 1999, section 169 of the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 or section 42A of the Student Assistance Act 1973. A Request for Refund (RFR) should be initiated on the employee’s record. Only whole payments can be requested and each payment must be requested individually. If there are multiple payments, the system totals the amount at the end of the day then sends a consolidated request to the financial institution.</p>
<p>Under Section 169 of the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, a third party debt is only a debt due to the Commonwealth if the incorrect payment was made by Services Australia. If an employer pays the Parental Leave Pay (PPL) into an incorrect account the amount is a debt due to the employer and the agency has no role in the recovery process.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if the agency pays the PPL funds which are intended for an employer account but are deposited into an incorrect account see <a href="../families/007-09010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Requesting_refu_Step01" target=_blank>PPL funds for employer paid to incorrect bank account table</a>.</p></div></div></div>
