		<ul>		<li>
be at least 15 years of age (a customer must be 18 years of age to access Small Business Coaching)</li>
		<li>
be an Australian citizen, or the holder of a permanent visa, or a nominated Visa holder (including a New Zealand Special Category Visa, Temporary Protection Visa Holder and a Safe Haven Visa Holder)</li>

<p>Business mentoring and support is an essential component of Self-Employment Assistance. Participants will receive business mentoring for 52 weeks under the Small Business Coaching phase. Participants will also receive advice about organisational, financial and marketing issues to support the development of their business.</p>

<p>Participants can receive Self-Employment Allowance for the first 39 weeks of the 52 week Small Business Coaching phase. The amount of Self-Employment Allowance payable will not be affected by income from the job seeker's business, as the allowance is paid by DEWR.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Most Self-Employment Assistance participants transfer from their income support payment to Self-Employment Allowance after they complete Small Business training and commence in Small Business Coaching.</p>

<p>Certain customers may be receiving a higher rate of income support than the amount paid under Self-Employment Allowance, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Special Benefit (SpB) job seekers who are single with a dependent child</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB single principal carers with long term exemptions</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers aged 60 and over, who have been in receipt of an income support payment for more than 9 continuous months, and</li>
		<li>
JSP and SpB job seekers who are assessed as either 'Illness Separated', 'Respite Care Couple' or 'Partner in prison'</li>
		</ul>
<p>These job seekers, if they have no affecting income, should be eligible to continue to receive a partial rate of their income support payment on top of their Self-Employment Allowance after the dollar-for-dollar reduction is applied.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of Austudy and Youth Allowance (job seeker, apprentice and student) will automatically cancel '<strong>CPP</strong> - Customer on Precluding Payment' when DEWR notify they are in receipt of Self-Employment Allowance. Other customers may cancel '<strong>SEA</strong> - Self-Employment Allowance' if they are no longer eligible for their income support payment due to receipt of Self-Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of the below payments can choose to remain on their income support payment while participating in Small Business Coaching, up to the maximum of 52 weeks. <strong>All</strong> other pension/payment <strong>and</strong> Small Business Coaching eligibility criteria <strong>must</strong> be met. Alternatively, they may elect to receive the Self-Employment Allowance and a partial rate of their income support payment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Carer Payment (CP)</li>
		<li>
Age Pension</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment (Partnered and Single)</li>
		<li>
Disability Support Pension (DSP)</li>
		<li>
Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Partner Service Pension, or</li>
		<li>
War Widow(er) Pension</li>
		</ul>
<p>Self-Employment Assistance rental assistance is available for up to 26 weeks to Small Business Coaching participants if eligible. Payment of this is determined by DEWR.</p>

<p>Self-Employment Allowance recipients who do not receive an income support payment may be eligible for a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06040000-01.html">Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).</a></p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Customers may concurrently participate in DES or PNX and Small Business Coaching. Once a job seeker is participating with DES or PNX, their DES or PNX provider may refer them to participate in Self-Employment Assistance, which includes Small Business Coaching.</p>

<p>Participating in Small Business Coaching and DES or PNX satisfies the mutual obligation or participation requirements for income support payments. Participants will still be required to report regularly to Services Australia to receive income support payments, including when they are on partial rates. Any business income <strong>must</strong> be declared and assessed as normal.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The amount of Self-Employment Allowance paid is equivalent to the 'single, 22 and over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP). Self-Employment Allowance reduces relevant income support (including add-ons) on a dollar-for-dollar basis, meaning some participants may no longer be entitled to their income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers receiving Self-Employment Allowance cannot obtain <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-09020000-01.html">early release of superannuation</a>. Self-Employment Allowance is specifically excluded by this legislation. Queries regarding this should be referred to Department of Employment and Work Relations National Customer Service Line.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The maximum period that Self-Employment Allowance is payable to a participant is 39 weeks from the start of the 52 week Small Business Coaching period.</p>

<p>As a result, these customers may contact the agency to test their eligibility for an income support payment for the final 13 weeks of Small Business Coaching. Provided these customers meet all other eligibility requirements, participation in Small Business Coaching does not preclude them from income support.</p>

<p>Participation in Small Business Coaching fully satisfies a customer's mutual obligation requirements or compulsory participation requirements. This means the job seeker will not be referred to a provider where they claim an income support payment during the last 13 weeks of Small Business Coaching, because they are already connected to a Self-Employment Assistance provider and not eligible for other employment services.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02100000-03.html">Process</a> page for coding procedures where a Small Business Coaching participant contacts the agency to claim an income support payment, or to have their rate of payment restored to the correct rate, following the cessation of their Self-Employment Allowance after 39 weeks. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Small Business Coaching participant will be prompted by their provider to supply their Self-Employment Allowance cessation letter as evidence.</p>

<p>Small Business Coaching participants who were receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Special Benefit (SpB) or Youth Allowance (YA) and whose payment was reduced or cancelled due to receiving the Self-Employment Allowance, will receive an advice from DEWR to verify that their Self-Employment Allowance has ceased.</p>

<p>After the 39 weeks, the system will automatically zero the Self-Employment Allowance on the Other Government Payments (<strong>OGP</strong>) screen. Staff may need to end any manual rate overrides that existed to continue partial rate payments during the 39 weeks of Self-Employment Allowance.</p>
