Retrospective backdating of income support to the year the child turned 4 years of age, where this occurs late in the 2nd lodgement year</li>
		<li>
Isolation/ remoteness issues relating to access to doctors/ nurses to conduct health checks, for example, access is only available through the flying doctor service and used for emergencies only. The Service Officer is to assess if it would be 'reasonable' for the customer to arrange for their child to undertake the health check given their circumstances</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Example of assessing special circumstance exemption</strong></p>

<p>Cecelia lives on a remote cattle station in the Northern Territory. Cecelia receives Parenting Payment Single and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for her child who turned 4 years of age in the 2017-18 financial year.</p>

<p>The nearest medical facility is several hundred kilometres away. The Royal Flying Doctor Service provides remote medical services online and by radio and provides a visiting service at least twice a year, as well as in emergency situations.</p>

<p>After receiving an FTB reconciliation letter informing her that HSFS requirements have affected her rate of FTB Part A supplement, Cecelia requests a special circumstances exemption on the basis that she will have to wait until the next available opportunity to organise a physical check for her child, which could be several months away.</p>

<p>Further, if circumstances prevent her from attending the next available appointment, she may have to wait again and she does not want to risk not being able to attend an appointment before the end of the lodgement year.</p>

<p><strong>Based on these facts, this would not constitute special circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>Using the 'reasonableness test' as detailed in <a href="../families/007-11010050-05.html#bp05_tbl_Special_circumstance_2">Item 2</a>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Were there multiple situations or events that the customer experienced which prevented her from arranging for her child to undertake the health check?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>No - only the one situation.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Was the situation unusual and/or extraordinary?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>No - this would be an expected circumstance living in a remote area.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Would the situations or events prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check before the end of the applicable timeframe for an automatic special circumstances exemption?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>No</strong> - <strong>even if Cecelia cannot get her child's health checked in the next couple of months, she still has until 30 June 2019 to get the health check completed and notify.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Would the general public consider it reasonable that the situation/s or event/s were sufficient to prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>No - the Service Officer may determine that the health check could be completed for the child. The check would just need to be delayed.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Has the customer explored all options in an attempt to satisfy the health check requirement?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>No - the customer has not advised if any attempt has been made to find other ways for their child to undertake the health check.</strong></p>

<p>If, in addition, Cecelia lives in a remote location and she also experienced other circumstances, such as her own recurring health issues that affected her ability to arrange a health check for her child, these other factors could together constitute special circumstances. These other factors could include that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Cecelia suffered from a major depressive disorder which meant that part way through the year her child turned 4 years of age she had to relinquish care to her child's grandparents, who lived in a town several hundred kilometres away</li>
		<li>
The grandparents had care of the child until the beginning of June 2019 (the applicable timeframe for a child turning 4 years of age in 2017-18) after the child turned 4 years of age and were not required to meet the health check requirement</li>
		<li>
In the meantime, Cecelia has recovered sufficiently from her illness and resumes care of her child at this time</li>
		<li>
As a result of a recent accident, Cecelia is temporarily without a vehicle and cannot take her child to the nearest town</li>
		<li>
Cecelia makes arrangements for her child to see a doctor from the Royal Flying Doctor Service, but as it is not an emergency, the visit will not occur for another month</li>
		</ul>
<p>Again applying the 'reasonableness test'&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Were there multiple situations or events that the customer experienced which prevented her from undertaking the health check for the child?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Yes - the customer experienced multiple situations at the one time.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Were the situations unusual and/or extraordinary?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Yes - some of them were. The customer did not expect to become ill or to lose care of her child.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Would the situations or events prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check before the end of the applicable timeframe for an automatic special circumstances exemption?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Maybe - the situations and/or events may make it difficult for the customer to arrange the health check before the end of the applicable timeframe.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Would the general public consider it reasonable that the situation/s or event/s were sufficient to prevent the customer from arranging for their child to undertake the health check?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Maybe - based on the time the child was in the customer's care the general public may determine that it would be difficult for the customer to arrange for their child to undertake the health check.</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Has the customer explored all options in an attempt to satisfy the health check requirement?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unknown. Need to discuss this with the customer to determine.</strong></p>

<p>The answers detailed above would not necessarily mean that special circumstances exist for Cecelia. The Service Officer would be required to use all the information available to make a decision about whether a special circumstance applies.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why do I need to have this Health Check for my child?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> A health check, for the Healthy Start for School initiative, is an assessment of the customer's child's physical health and general well-being and will include height, weight, hearing and vision. This basic health check promotes early detection of life risk factors, delayed development and illness which may make it more difficult for children to learn when they start school.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Why am I being asked to do this, when my friend has a child the same age and isn't being asked to do this?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The aim of a preschool health check is to improve the health and well-being of Australian children. Health checks are available for all children and may detect problems affecting hearing and vision that make it more difficult to learn. To ensure their children are healthy, fit and ready to learn when they start school, some families are being asked to have their child undertake a health check and notify the agency.</p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_FAQs_from_customers_3"></a>
<p>3</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How much is this going to cost me?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The health check can be done by a recognised health professional such as a doctor, practise nurse or Aboriginal health worker and the customer should discuss any cost or potential Medicare refund with them.</p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_FAQs_from_customers_4"></a>

<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What happens if my child didn't pass the Health Check - do I still get my supplement?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The requirement is for the customer's child to have a health check completed. The health check will be recorded as being completed, not the outcome of the health check. If the health professional identifies any issue that requires action or follow-up, they will discuss this with the customer.</p>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_FAQs_from_customers_5"></a>
<p>5</p></td>
<td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I have not been able to arrange a health check appointment before 30 June 2018 for my child who turned 4 years of age in 2017-18 as there are limited services and appointments in my area. Can I get an exemption from having to get the health check completed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> These circumstances do not qualify for an exemption. If the customer is unable to organise an appointment on or before 30 June 2018, they have until 30 June of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12) following the year in which the child turned 4 years of age. Re-reconciliation will occur to pay any FTB Part A supplement (if entitled) for the child for any day/s where they or their partner were receiving an income support payment in the financial year their child turned 4 years of age.</p>

<p>For children who turn 4 years of age on or after 1 July 2018, the HSFS requirement is linked to the customer’s rate of FTB Part A for that child. The health check and notification must be met by the child’s fifth birthday. See <a href="../families/007-18043001-01.html">Healthy Start for School (HSFS) requirements from 1 July 2018</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; My child turns 4 in early June. What happens if I cannot arrange a health check appointment until after 30 June?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> The FTB Part A supplement for the child will be withheld at reconciliation if the health check has not occurred. The customer then has until 30 June of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12) following the financial year in which the child turned 4 years of age to notify the health check has been completed for the child. If notification is received within the allowed period, the supplement entitlement will be re-reconciled.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I got my FTB reconciliation letter which says I have not had a health check completed for my 4 year old child and have not been paid my FTB Part A supplement. What can I do?</strong></p>

<p>Has a health check been completed since the child turned 3?</p>

<p>If response '<strong>No</strong>'&#58;</p>

<p>The agency will be able to re-reconcile the supplement entitlement if the customer arranges a relevant health check for the child and notify it has been completed. The customer has until 30 June of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12) following the financial year in which the child turned 4 years of age to notify the health check has been completed for the child to have the supplement entitlement re-reconciled.</p>

<p>If response '<strong>Yes</strong>'&#58;</p>

<p>The agency can update the details advising completion of the health check. If notification is received before the end of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12) the supplement entitlement will be included (if entitled) in re-reconciliation.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I/my partner no longer receive/s an ISP - do I still have to have the health check completed and notify for my 4 year old child?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> <strong>Yes</strong>, as the customer and/or their partner received an ISP for at least 1 day in the financial year in which their child turned 4 years of age the health check requirements apply. If the requirements are not met when reconciliation occurs for the financial year, the customer may not receive the FTB Part A supplement for the day/s the ISP was paid.</p>
