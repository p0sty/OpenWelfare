<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> principal carers combining suitable self-employment and other paid work, or self-employment and approved study must complete a combined total of 30 hours per fortnight.</p>

<p>Once the self-employment (<strong>SEL</strong>) is approved, it is coded on the job seeker's record, the details are sent to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and the job seeker will be suspended from Employment Provider Services. This suspension is automatic. There is no need for the job seeker to discuss this with their Employment Services Provider. However, the job seeker may choose to volunteer into Employment Provider Services. In these cases, the job seeker must discuss this with their provider.</p>

<p>If the self-employment does not satisfy the sufficient work test, the job seeker must do another approved activity entirely or may be able to combine their self-employment with another approved activity.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Services Australia can approve employment combinations for both Centrelink and provider managed job seekers. In the case of job seekers aged 55 and over, Services Australia can approve voluntary work and employment combinations. Services Australia can also approve a combination of self-employment, paid part-time work and/or approved study for principal carers. Only an Employment Services Provider can approve voluntary work or a combination of voluntary work and other activities for principal carers under 55.</p>

<p>If the job seeker is not doing activities that enable them to be Centrelink managed and they are not exempt from mutual obligation requirements, they must be referred to an Employment Services Provider if they have not already been connected.</p>

<p>Employment Services Providers are responsible for negotiating and maintaining the Job Plan for provider managed job seeker.</p>

<p>Advise the job seeker of the decision. Record decision and conversation with the job seeker on a closed <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Self-employment must equal 30 hours or more per fortnight for partial capacity to work (PCW) 15-29 hours per week, job seekers aged 55 and over and principal carers. In addition, net business income <strong>must also</strong> equal or be more than the national minimum wage per fortnight for the number of required hours.</p>

<p>Job seekers assessed with a PCW or temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week may fully meet their mutual obligation requirements through self-employment or a combination of self-employment and paid work within their assessed bandwidth.</p>

<p>Principal carers can also combine self-employment and other paid work, or self-employment and study totalling at least 30 hours per fortnight to fully meet requirements, as long as the total remuneration is sufficient for the agreed hours of self-employment.</p>

<p>Record the self-employment on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen in Process Direct using the following codes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For job seekers aged 55 and over doing a combination of voluntary work and self-employment, in Process Direct use both codes of '<strong>SEL</strong>' and '<strong>VWK</strong>' by&#58;</li>

		<li>
For principal carers doing a combination of self-employment and other paid work, follow the above steps and use the code '<strong>PWS</strong>'</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For principal carers doing a combination of self-employment and approved study, use the code of '<strong>SSE</strong>'</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>The start date used for the <strong>AEX</strong> screen should be the date of coding, to ensure details are transferred to DEWR system</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Self-Employment (<strong>SEL</strong>) should not be coded on the <strong>AEX</strong> screen for more than 12 months (363 days) at a time </li>
		<li>
After the AEX screen is updated, the system identifies if the Job Plan is to be updated. When a new job plan needs to be negotiated, an <strong>Action Item</strong> message will display stating&#58; “<strong>Job Plan requires at least one compulsory requirement. Ensure Job Plan is updated taking into consideration the job seeker's participation category</strong>”</li>

		<ul>		<li>
are fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements while they are doing the agreed approved activity</li>
		<li>
do not have job search efforts however, they still must declare their participation in the approved activity to Services Australia each fortnight</li>
		<li>
will be automatically suspended from Employment Provider Services, however they can voluntarily continue to participate with their provider</li>
		<li>
must advise Services Australia of changes about their participation in the agreed approved activity (e.g. cessation of self-employment or increase in income) within the <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-08040010-01.html">required timeframe</a></li>
		<li>
how their mutual obligation requirements may change if their circumstances change</li>
		<li>
if they are not connected to a provider or they are suspended from Employment Provider Services, they do not need to attend ongoing provider appointments</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers aged 55 and over are suspended from Employment Provider Services, however, they must stay connected to their provider and must accept full-time, suitable paid work or an increase in their work hours and must accept all referrals to suitable job interviews.</p>

<p>Job seekers who are self-employed <strong>and</strong> have had their business income assessed, only need to report they have met their mutual obligation requirements.</p>

If business income has been assessed and there have not been any significant changes to business activity, they only need to write 'as previously declared' in the earnings section if  reporting via a Reporting Statement (SU19) form. If the job seeker is reporting via self service, their business details will be displayed and the job seeker can advise if there has been any change.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> any changes to business activity must be notified along with other changes during the reporting process.</p>
