<p>Record the amount a school or scholarship provider contributes towards a scholarship in the <strong>Scholarship Contribution Amount</strong> field on the <strong>EYSB</strong> screen. This amount is normally a reduction or waiver in board and/or tuition fees.</p>

<p>The scholarship component waiving, exempting or reducing costs is not regarded as income for ABSTUDY purposes. Record details of scholarship on a <strong>Note</strong>/<strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Boarding school has not specified percentage of fees covered</strong></p>

<p>If a boarding school has not specified what amount of the total scholarship is attributed to a reduction in boarding fees and/or tuition fees, the boarding school must be contacted via phone and the information requested verbally. Where a boarding school advises that they are unable to provide the percentage of fees covered, send an email outlining the situation to the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030070-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Intranet_links">Program Management Students mailbox</a>. The Level 3 helpdesk will liaise with the school to determine coding requirements. Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Scholarship covers a portion of all fees</strong></p>

<p>Ensure the amounts keyed on the <strong>Annual Boarding School/Hostel Amount</strong> field and the <strong>Annual Fees/Tuition Amount</strong> field on the <strong>EYSB</strong> screen and/or <strong>Net Rent Amount</strong> field on the Accommodation History (<strong>ACS</strong>) screen is the net amount of the school charges after the scholarship has been deducted.</p>

<p>For example, if the school charge is normally $10,000 per annum for board and a scholarship contributes $4,000 per annum to the boarding fees, the correct amount to key on the <strong>Annual Boarding School/Hostel Amount</strong> field is the net amount of $6,000.</p>

<p>This ensures that the correct amount is paid to the boarding school or hostel, and any excess Living Allowance is paid back to parent/guardian/student.</p>

<p><strong>Scholarship covers 100% of all fees</strong></p>

<p>Where a boarding school pays 100% of a student's boarding and tuition costs, information must still be recorded on the <strong>EYSB</strong> screen to include the student in the family pool calculation and the payment on advice process.</p>

<p>The <strong>EYSB</strong> screen will need to be completed with the following information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Annual Fees/Tuition Amount to be recorded as $0.01</li>
		<li>
Boarding School/Hostel Action as '<strong>ASC</strong>' (Accepted to board at a boarding school)</li>
		<li>
Annual Boarding School/Hostel Amount as $0.01</li>
		<li>
Scholarship Contribution Amount as the total amount of the scholarship contribution (100% of board and tuition charges) from the school, or from the scholarship provider organisation for Third Party Indigenous Scholarship or a Transition School Scholarship</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Event Date</strong> and <strong>Actual Term Start Date</strong> fields are to be completed as per the customer's circumstances.</p>

<p>Record details of the coding of <strong>EYSB</strong> screen on a <strong>Note</strong>/<strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is a component of the scholarship paid for a purpose other than reducing/waving/exempting fees or boarding/lodging, that component is assessable as income. To key the income, see <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07030070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessment_of_s_Step04">Step 4 in Table 2</a>. Otherwise procedure ends</p>

<p>There are 8 'gap' scholarship providers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Rosemary Bishop Indigenous Education Scholarship (RBIES) delivered by Yalari organisation</li>
		<li>
Indigenous Youth Leadership Program (IYLP) delivered through the Young Australians organisation</li>

		<li>
Transitional School Scholarship (Melbourne Indigenous Transition School)</li>
		<li>
Woomera Education Scholarship Trust (WEST)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Centrelink has received written confirmation that these scholarships only constitute an amount up to the gap between the school's board/tuition charge and the amount ABSTUDY contributes. For example, if a school charges $10,000 for board and $10,000 for tuition and ABSTUDY contributes $9,000 towards board and $8,500 towards tuition, the scholarship will constitute an amount up to the gap of $1,000 board and $1,500 tuition.</p>

<p>Where the ABSTUDY contribution is at least equal to the school's board and/or tuition charges, the scholarship will constitute non-board/tuition assistance such as enrolment fees, books, excursions, camps etc.</p>

<p>Key the <strong>EYSB</strong> and <strong>ACS</strong> screens with the actual full school board and tuition charge in the knowledge that the scholarship will not constitute more than the gap.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> students who receive an Aboriginal Advancement League's First Nations Scholarship, reside at the Lady Gladys Nicholls Hostel, and attend Ivanhoe Grammar School are not charged tuition fees. The tuition charge on the <strong>EYSB </strong>screen should be coded as $0.01.</p>

<p>There is no need to ask for individual scholarship amounts for these scholarships. Do <strong>not</strong> key the Scholarship Contribution Amount on <strong>EYSB</strong> screen for any of these scholarships.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an Equity or Merit based Scholarship is coded as a fortnightly or periodic payment, the exempt income amount is spread out over the calendar year.

The relevant income test is then applied to any remaining amounts each fortnight or period.

<p>If the scholarship has ceased, select the scholarship from the <strong>OINS</strong> screen. Insert a new line with the following information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Event Date&#58;</strong> for annual payments, the event date will be one year later than previous entry (if the payment has been made for more than one year, the event date will be 12 months from the last payment). For periodic payments, the event date will be after the end of the period for the last payment. For example, if payments are made each fortnight, the date will be after the fortnight from the last fortnightly payment. For example, the last payday for the scholarship is 16/06/2019 and therefore the DOV to zero the income would be 30/06/2019</li>
