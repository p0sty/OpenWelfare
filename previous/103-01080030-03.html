<p>There are two parts to the process of assessing exemptions for customers with dependent children.</p>

<p>Part one of the exemption process requires a customer to demonstrate there have been no indications of financial vulnerability during the 12 month period ending immediately before the date of the exemption application.</p>

<p>The principles for determining that no indications of financial vulnerability were present during the previous 12 months are that the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Has been applying appropriate resources to meet their and their dependents priority needs</li>
		<li>
Had stable payment patterns and budgeting practices and is meeting priority needs from their income support and family assistance payments</li>
		<li>
Had control over their money and was not subject to financial exploitation</li>
		<li>
Did not regularly require urgent funds to pay for foreseeable costs, or did not frequently change their income support pay dates. Consideration is given to the reason for seeking the urgent payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information about the Financial Vulnerability test, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01080040-01.html">Conducting the financial vulnerability test for an exemption from Income Management for customers with dependent children</a>.</p>

<p>Part two of the exemption process requires a customer with dependent children of compulsory school age for the purposes of Income Management or younger to demonstrate they are undertaking responsible parenting.</p>

<p>Any exemption granted will remain valid for a period of 12 months.</p>

<p>At the end of the 12 months the customer will be advised they are eligible for Income Management and must contact Services Australia for an initial assessment. The customer can reapply for an exemption from Income Management at this time and will have access to the same engagement and grace periods as any other 'new' customer.</p>

<p>Although exemptions are not reviewed during the 12 month period, it may be reassessed prior to the end of the 12 month exemption period in cases where an individual's circumstances have significantly changed. See the <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01080030-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of when a review of an exemption would be appropriate.</p>

<p>The principles for determining responsible parenting in relation to each child of compulsory school age for the purposes of Income Management require one of the following to be met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
School attendance (less than 5 satisfactory absences)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The child is enrolled in and attending school</li>
			<li>
Has no more than 5 absences for each of the previous 2 school terms that are not satisfactory to the person responsible for the operation of the school, and</li>
			<li>
The customer provides evidence of school attendance. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01080030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Evidence_requir_1">Step 1 in the Evidence required for activity</a> table</li>		</ul>
		<li>
School attendance (five or more unsatisfactory absences)&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The child is enrolled in and attending school</li>
			<li>
Has 5 or more absences that are not satisfactory to a person responsible for the operation of the school, and</li>
			<li>
The customer is taking reasonable steps to ensure the child attends school as required. For example, they have taken action to stop truancy by addressing bullying at school</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Home schooling&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The child is approved to receive home based schooling, or other alternative schooling arrangement, in accordance with the relevant state or territory legislation, and</li>
			<li>
The customer must provide evidence of home schooling. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01080030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Evidence_requir_2">Step 2 in the Evidence required for activity</a> table</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Special circumstances&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If there are special circumstances preventing participation in schooling, the customer must provide evidence of special circumstances for non-enrolment and attendance. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01080030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Evidence_requir_3">Step 3 in the Evidence required for activity</a> table</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>In the case of changed care arrangements, a foster parent or dependent carer should not be held responsible for attendance patterns prior to the time the child entered their care. School attendance should be considered only from the time the child commences care with the foster parent or dependent carer.</p>

		<li>

<p>In cases where a child under compulsory school age for the purposes of Income Management has significant disabilities, three <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01080030-03.html#bp03050007_6">Health Related Activities</a> would be appropriate, due to the difficulty of finding appropriately supported social activities.</p>

<p>Evidence of significant disabilities would need to be provided to the agency in the form of a Doctor's Certificate or Treating Doctor's Report (TDR). The Income Management Exemption and Assessment Team (IMEAT) are the primary decision makers in granting an exemption in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Additional updates are required for customers impacted by the Healthy Start for School initiative. If they lodge evidence to support their Income Management exemption application which proves the child has completed a relevant health check since turning 3, their health check status should also be updated.

<p>Customers, with dependent children, not currently income managed but eligible for Income Management, are given a 28 day grace period to gather the evidence required to be granted an exemption.</p>

<p>This means, once the customer applies for an exemption, they will have 28 days to gather the required information before Income Management is applied.</p>

<p>This grace period is in addition the 28/56 day engagement period.</p>

<p>At the end of the grace period, if the exemption has not been granted, the customer is given an additional engagement period to complete an initial assessment for Income Management before Auto Income Management is applied.</p>

<p>Customers who are already income managed and are applying for an exemption, have 28 days to complete their application. At the end of the 28 days, if the required evidence has not been provided, the application will be rejected and Income Management will continue to apply.</p>

<p>Evidence of attendance at school is taken from the child's school report which, in the Northern Territory, includes the total number of absences.</p>

<p>Where the school reports show there have been <strong>more</strong> than 5 absences in either of the last two terms or semester, the customer will be asked to obtain evidence directly from the school. This is to determine whether the absences were satisfactory to the person responsible for the operation of the school.</p>

<p>The school report, together with other evidence provided by the school, would be considered definitive.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Parent/principal carer would not be able to provide evidence to the agency where the school has wrongly reported their child's attendance</li>
		<li>
If the parent/principal carer felt the school had misrepresented their child's attendance, they should be advised to follow this up with the school, and seek to have an amended report issued or a letter from the school correcting the information</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Customers with children attending a Northern Territory Department of Education school</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The parent/principal carer has to request the child's attendance report for Income Management exemption purposes</li>
		<li>
The individual student attendance record will be produced by school staff and forwarded to the Principal of the school</li>
		<li>
When the Principal approves the report it is emailed to the Income Management Exemption and Assessment Team (IMEAT) and where possible the parent/principal carer will be cc'd into the email</li>
		<li>
It is the responsibility of parent/principal carer to follow up with the agency to make sure the report has been received</li>
		<li>
Where a parent/principal carer disputes the record, they must contact the School Enrolment and Attendance Team and lodge their dispute</li>
		<li>
Burden of proof rests with the parent/principal carer</li>
		<li>
Where a parent/principal carer can prove their child was present, a school can change the record</li>
		<li>
Where a parent/principal carer attains a medical certificate or other evidence for dates marked with a 'U' or 'X' code after a 10 week period, the school will not change the record as this is not evidence of the timely notification of the absence</li>
