<p>Pre-birth and post-birth PPL claims can be made non effective (<strong>NEF</strong>).</p>

<p>In most cases, the NEF will occur automatically when processing the claim. However, manual coding can be completed in certain circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic NEF assessments</strong></p>

<p>For PPL pre-claims that have been assessed and are awaiting proof of the child's birth or entry to care, a reminder letter will be sent 14 days after the nominated start date to provide the proof.</p>

<p>If the proof of birth is not provided within 56 days of the nominated start date, the claim will be automatically assessed as NEF.</p>

<p><strong>PPL already claimed by customer</strong></p>

<p>For duplicate PPL claims lodged where the&#58;</p>

the secondary claimant claims the PPL entitlement.<br>Any subsequent claims lodged by the primary claimant will automatically assess as Not Effective <strong>NEF-PAO</strong> (PPL already claimed by other claimants)</li>		</ul>
