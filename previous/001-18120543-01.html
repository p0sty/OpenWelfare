<p>This document provides details on processing Reporting Statements (SU19).</p>

<p>Reporting via self service options is the preferred channel choice for Services Australia. Verbal reporting is the next preferred channel, with paper reporting by exception only.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Completing_and_"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Completing_and_">Completing and lodging Reporting Statement Application for payment</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Reporting Statement Application for payment (SU19) is only to be used by exception.</p>

<p>The Reporting Statement (SU19) allows Services Australia&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
to check if the Centrelink managed job seeker is complying with their mutual obligation or participation requirements</li>
		<li>
to check that no notifiable events have occurred within the reporting period, and</li>
		<li>
informs the agency of the job seeker's or participant's own (and/or their partner's) income</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the job seeker or participant is completing their report using the Reporting Statement Application for payment (SU19) form it must be completed in pen and be signed and dated by the job seeker. Any change of circumstances updated by the job seeker must be recorded on the job seeker's record.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Reporting_State"></a>
<h3>Reporting Statements for Variable reporters</h3>


<p>The Reporting Statement itself covers the whole variable report period and the reporting date. The Reporting Statement is issued as part of the Multi Attachment Template (MAT) with a cover letter advising the customers of their requirements to report changes in their circumstances (for example, employment income) by the end of each fortnightly entitlement period and not wait until the variable report due date. For example, if a customer is a 4 weekly reporter, the Reporting Statement will be for 12 weeks with the 3 due dates included. The Reporting Statement - MAT cover letter will list 6 entitlement periods and the dates the customer must notify Services Australia of any changes in their circumstances which occurred in that particular entitlement period.</p>

<p>Customers can view a summary of their due to report dates and reporting periods in their online account. The online account will display all reporting periods within 12 weeks of the date viewed.</p>

<p>Customers with mutual obligation or participation requirements who report via self service prior to being placed on variable reporting may also be exempt from personal lodgement requirements. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-18120543-01.html#bp01_L3GT_Permanent_exemp">Personal lodgement exemptions</a>.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Reporting_State01"></a>
<h3>Reporting Statement structure</h3>


<p>The Reporting Statement is structured as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>When to report</strong> block on the first page lists up to 6 entitlement periods and the day and date on which the customer must report for each period. The customer's payment is not issued unless they report</li>
		<li>
<strong>What to report</strong> information is directly under the <strong>When to report</strong> block on the first page of the Reporting Statement. The customer is given instruction on how to provide their employment income or mutual obligation requirements if applicable and what changes in circumstances they must declare</li>
		<li>
<strong>How to report</strong> information is at the bottom of the first page. It provides the telephone number and/or internet address for reporting</li>
		<li>
<strong>Changes you must tell us about</strong> block is on the second page of the Reporting Statement. It provides information regarding changes of circumstances which customers are required to notify Services Australia about, and confirms the reporting requirements regarding these changes</li>
		</ul><a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Questions_on_th"></a>
<h3>Questions on the Reporting Statement Application for payment (SU19)</h3>


<p>Reporting via self service options is the preferred channel choice for Services Australia, then verbal reporting, with paper reporting by <strong>exception only</strong>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Reporting Statement (SU19) is to establish entitlement on an ongoing basis by asking relevant questions. The following information is requested&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
details of income paid during the reporting period</li>
		<li>
any changes in circumstances</li>
		<li>
if the customer has completed an approved activity</li>
		<li>
if the customer has been incapacitated and unable to work or study</li>
		<li>
attendance at training courses or approved activities, and confirmation any mutual obligation requirements or Participation requirements have been met (unless exemptions exist)</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the job seeker or participant completes their report on their reporting day, they must answer all questions. Where the job seeker has not answered a question regarding their circumstances, this question needs to be followed up with the job seeker verbally and documented prior to the processing of the form to ensure they have met their mutual obligation or participation requirements.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Reporting_State02"></a>
<h3>Reporting Statement due date</h3>


<p>A customer must report on their due to report date because the questions in the Reporting Statement relate to the full fortnight period or the relevant period for <a href="../job-seekers/001-18120536-01.html">variable reporters</a>.</p>

<p>This document outlines information on the postal or fax lodgement of a Reporting Statement (SU19) form for customers who do not normally use self service (online account, Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or phone) and refers to those customers who choose to lodge a SU19 form in person for their payment to be generated and are normally required to lodge in person, but who have been granted a temporary exemption from reporting in person.</p>

<p>This document outlines information about the third party lodgement of Reporting Statement (SU19) forms. It is relevant for all customers who must lodge a Reporting Statement (SU19) form in person for their payment to be generated, including Parenting Payment (PP) customers with compulsory mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Processing_Repo">Processing Reporting Statements</h2>

		<div class="block">

<p>Use <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> to process the Reporting Statement (SU19) in person or verbally via phone. Payment will be issued (generally on the next working day) after the report has been finalised. This includes <a href="../job-seekers/001-18120536-01.html">variable lodgement</a>.</p>

<p>Encourage the customer to use self service facilities to process their application for payment when they present without their SU19. If the customer refuses or is unable to use self service, the Service Officer can take verbal declaration of income and confirmation of mutual obligation or participation requirements from the customer.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Reporting_optio"></a>
<h3>Reporting options</h3>


<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Self service reporting is the preferred option for customers in receipt of JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker), Parenting Payment (PP) and Special Benefit (SpB) (under JSP conditions) subject to mutual obligation or participation requirements.</p>

<p>Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an Exception applies.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Eligible_for_th"></a>
<h3>Eligible for third party lodgement</h3>


<p><strong>Principal carers</strong> or <strong>customers with a Partial Capacity to Work</strong> may authorise another person to lodge their Reporting Statement (SU19) form on their behalf on a regular basis, where they are fully meeting requirements, as set out in their Job Plan through&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
part-time work</li>
		<li>
self-employment</li>
		<li>
studying full time, but they or their partner report employment income, or</li>
		<li>
having an exemption, but they or their partner report employment income</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> consider the customer's capacity to report by one of the self service options prior to granting approval for customers to use a third party for reporting for payments</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L3GT_Third_party_lod"></a>
<h3>Third party lodgement process</h3>


<p>If another person is lodging a Reporting Statement (SU19) form on their behalf, the customer is required to attach a letter with the name of the person lodging the form for them and explaining&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
why they are unable to put their form in themselves, and</li>
		<li>
why they are getting someone else to do it for them</li>
		</ul>
<p>The form still needs to have all questions completed in pen, signed and dated by the customer on their due to lodge date.</p>

<p>The customer is only required to provide the signed authorisation documentation once. The customer or their partner is still required to report their employment income according to the agreed frequency. The customer should be advised that the initial letter needs to indicate that this 'agent' will be lodging on their behalf on an ongoing basis. On receipt of the initial Reporting Statement (SU19) form and authorising letter record a Display On Access (DOA) <strong>DOC</strong> on the customer's record with the 'Expiry Date' as either the date customer stated on the authorisation document or the end date of their approved activity or exemption, whichever is the earlier.</p>
