<p>When assessing the income from a sole trader business, there are some points to note&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a number of bank accounts are recorded on the Balance Sheet, identify which account is the working capital account</li>
		<li>
With the exception of bank accounts (for example, working capital account) and investments used as part of the ongoing operations of the business, financial investments (for example, cash on hand, shares, bank accounts, managed investments) are considered to be the customer's personal assets, and should be recorded separately on Savings (<strong>SVP</strong>), Managed Investment (<strong>MIP</strong>) or Securities and Investments (<strong>SIP</strong>) screens</li>
		<li>
Salary or wages paid by the business to the customer should not be assessed as the customer's salary. The amount should be added back on to the net profit of the business. This is because a sole trader cannot employ themselves as a bona fide employee</li>
		<li>
Not all deductions are allowable reductions for social security payments. Any non-allowable reductions should be added back onto the net profit of the business. The following non-allowable reductions are commonly claimed&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Prior year losses</li>
			<li>
Donations</li>
			<li>
Special building write off, and</li>
			<li>
Borrowing costs. These are also known as preliminary expenses, capital expenses or formation costs</li>
			<li>
see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03100020-01.html">Business Deductions</a> for more information</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Cash Flow Boost payments paid by the Australian Tax Office to eligible small and medium sized businesses as part of the Australian Government COVID-19 stimulus response are exempt from assessment under section 8(8)(zt) of the Social Security Act 1991, and are not to be included when assessing business income for a customer or their partner. Payments were made for the March to June 2020 and June to September 2020 quarters. If these payments have been included as income on the profit and loss statement for the sole trader business, they will need to be removed and disregarded in assessing the net income.</p>

<p>If the person runs more than one business within the sole trader structure, <strong>generally</strong> the losses of one business <strong>cannot</strong> be used to offset the profit of another. Losses within a sole trader business or partnership can be offset against the profits of other <strong>necessarily</strong> related activities if a customer is involved in a business or partnership which operates in more than one field or in 2 businesses, each operating under a different business structure. More information is available in the Social Security Guide, 4.7.1.30. See the <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03060020-04.html">References</a> page. <strong>See also&#58;</strong> <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03100070-01.html">Offsetting profit and losses between businesses</a>.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
It is generally not possible to determine the exact rate of income earned by a customer from a business due to the annual nature of assessment by the Taxation Office. The usual approach is to base the assessment of the likely current income received by a customer from a business on the most recently available financial statements and tax return</li>
		<li>
Check with the customer that the income arrived at, represents the current income of the business. For example, if the business has lost a contract or suffered some <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03130070-01.html">other reduction in income</a>, ask the customer to provide an interim Profit and Loss Statement for the business from the date of notifiable event. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03080040-01.html">Steps to assess an interim profit and loss statement</a></li>
		<li>
 Small income fluctuations should generally be ignored if they are part of normal trading. For example, if a retail store has a quiet period in January and the sole trader claims income support, it would be necessary to look at the pattern of trading. If business always reduces after the Christmas period then this would not be considered a significant event (this represents a true picture of the seasonal nature of the business activity)</li>
		<li>
From 1 July 2019, if the customer is eligible for Work Bonus it will automatically apply to the percentage of their business income derived from personal exertion.

<p>When assessing the income of a partnership business, consider the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Shares and financial investments&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
If these have been brought into the partnership as a partnership asset and held in the name of one of the partners, they should be regarded as the person's personal investment</li>
			<li>
Record separately on the Savings (<strong>SVP</strong>), Managed Investment (<strong>MIP</strong>) or Securities and Investments (<strong>SIP</strong>) screens</li>
			<li>
Ensure these amounts are not double counted when recording business assets</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Loans made by partners to the partnership&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
These are not regarded as loans</li>
			<li>
They are regarded as an injection of capital into the partnership</li>
			<li>
 The amount of such loans should be <strong>added back</strong> to the equity or the assessable value of the business partner's interest in the business</li>
			<li>
These amounts are not subject to deeming</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Drawings are not assessable income&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
They are withdrawals of capital previously advanced to the business</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Offsetting losses&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
When a partnership runs more than one business activity within the partnership, a loss on one activity cannot be offset against the profit from another activity unless the businesses are necessarily related. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03100070-01.html">Offsetting profit and losses between businesses</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Previous years' losses&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Losses from previous years cannot be offset against current year's profits</li>			</ul>			</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
Not all deductions are allowable reductions for social security payments. Remove any non-allowable deductions from the Profit and Loss Statement and tax return. The following non-allowable reductions are commonly claimed&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Prior years' losses</li>
			<li>
Donations</li>
			<li>
Special building write off, and</li>
			<li>
<a href="../business-and-employers/043-03100020-01.html">Borrowing costs</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
Salary or wages paid by the partnership to the customer are not to be assessed as the customer's salary. The amount is to be added back on to the net profit of the business. This is because a partner in partnership cannot employ themselves as a bona fide employee</li>
		<li>
Check the personal tax return - sometimes, additional expenses incurred in producing the income of a partnership will be detailed separately on one of the partner's personal tax returns, rather than on the partnership profit and loss statement</li>
		<li>
Check with the customer that the income calculated represents the current income of the business. For example, if the business has lost a contract or suffered some other reduction in income, ask the customer to provide an interim Profit and Loss Statement for the last 3 to 6 months. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03080040-01.html">Steps to assess an interim profit and loss statement</a></li>
		<li>
Small income fluctuations should generally be ignored if they are part of normal trading. For example, if a retail store has a quiet period in January and the partners claim income support, it would be necessary to look at the pattern of trading. If business always reduced after the Christmas period then this would <strong>not</strong> be a significant event (this represents a true picture of the seasonal nature of the business activity)</li>
		<li>
From 1 July 2019, if the customer is eligible for <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">Work Bonus</a> it will automatically apply to the percentage of their business income derived from personal exertion. The customer will be asked for the percentage in the Business details (MOD F) form. The percentage will need to be recorded on the Business Details (<strong>BUS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
If the partnership is being reviewed or updated, check the percentage of the income derived from personal exertion is still accurate</li>
		</ul>
<p>Notify the customer of the assessed income from the partnership business and advise them that if in the future there is a significant increase or decrease in the assessed amount, they should notify Services Australia immediately.</p>

A customer's interest in the assets of a business falls within the definition of 'asset'</li>
		<li>
A member of a business conducted as a partnership owns a share of the assets of the business. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03090010-01.html">Business assets</a></li>
		<li>
The amount to be taken into account for assets test purposes is the current market value of the assessable assets, less the 'business' liabilities (as listed on the business's financial statements and which are allowable encumbrances in accordance with section 1121 of the Social Security Act 1991). See the <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03060020-04.html">References</a> page</li>
		<li>
Unless there has been a significant change of circumstances, the asset position of the business is derived from the most recent Balance Sheet and Depreciation Schedule. Adjustments may need to be made to the business assets to reflect current market value, not depreciated value</li>
		<li>
The value of the customer's interest in a partnership will depend on the net value of the partnership assets, the proportion of the net assets the customer is entitled to receive and the net amounts contributed or withdrawn by the individual partners. (This will be shown on the Balance Sheet Capital Accounts.) See Assessment of income and assets from <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03110060-01.html">sole traders</a> and <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03120060-01.html">partnerships</a></li>
		<li>
Ensure any financial assets are separated from the business, as they are considered to be the customer's personal assets - with the exception of investments used in the ongoing operation of the business (for example, the working capital account used for trading)</li>
		<li>
Business assets and liabilities are assessed as either primary production or non-primary production. <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04100000-01.html">Primary production aggregation</a> rules allow for all primary production liabilities to be offset against all primary production assets. Non-primary production assets and liabilities are not covered by these aggregation rules. <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04020040-01.html">Non-primary production liabilities</a> can only be offset against the specific asset they are secured against as per the principles outlined in Section 1121 of the Social Security Act 1991</li>
		<li>
If there is real estate recorded on the Balance Sheet, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07100130-01.html">Assessing and coding real estate details</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Real estate should not be linked to a business unless advised and assessed by a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)</li>		</ul>
