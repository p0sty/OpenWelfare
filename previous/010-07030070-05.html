<p><strong>Exempt income for Equity or Merit based Scholarship</strong></p>

<p>The exempt income amount of $9,174 is spread out over the calendar year. The exempt income is divided by 26 fortnights.</p>

<p>$9,174 divided by 26 = $352.85 per fortnight.</p>

<p>A customer who has an Equity or Merit based Scholarship coded as fortnightly payments of $450 over 19 fortnights attract an equivalent proportion of the exempt income of $352.85 per fortnight. The income test is then applied to the remaining amount each fortnight of $97.15.</p>

<p>Even though the customer receives a total scholarship amount of $8,550 ($450 x 19 fortnights), they are only entitled to an exempt income reduction of $6,704.15 ($352.85 x 19 fortnights) as they are not receiving the scholarship over the whole calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>Griffith Connect Academic Excellence Bursary</strong></p>

<p>This scholarship is aimed at attracting high achieving students to study at Griffith University. It is a one-off payment of $3,000 paid within 6 weeks of the start of semester 1.</p>

<p>This bursary is awarded as a prize and is therefore an exempt lump sum and not considered ordinary income for social security and ABSTUDY payments.</p>

<p><strong>Long Tan Bursary</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) provides a bursary payable to eligible children of Vietnam Veterans through the Vietnam Veterans Trust.</p>

<p>The bursary has been established to meet the cost of tertiary education and help them obtain formal qualifications and skills needed to pursue their chosen career. Tertiary study includes vocationally oriented TAFE courses, business colleges and arts schools etc. The bursary is valued at up to $9,000 over 3 years and can be used to help cover costs such as enrolment, course fees, and textbooks. Fifty bursaries are awarded across Australia.</p>

<p>This bursary is treated as income of the individual and is assessed in the following manner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The lump sum amount paid at the beginning of the academic year (generally March) is assessed as income over 12 months from when the person was entitled to receive the amount</li>
		<li>
Similar treatment is applied to the receipt of a smaller lump sum paid for the commencement of the second semester (that is it is regarded as a lump sum for assessment purposes)</li>
		<li>
The remainder of the year's money is paid in 10 monthly equal instalments during the academic year (that is March to December inclusive) and are assessed throughout that period as periodic payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>This should be considered as an equity and merit scholarship (EMS) and it attracts the threshold exemption under subsection 8(8)(zjd) of the Social Security Act 1991. The scholarship should be keyed as the full scholarship amount. The system auto-reduces the income by the threshold amount.</p>
