<p>When assessing CITW, the possibility of undertaking training <strong>must</strong> be considered. Training for the purposes of these provisions include&#58;</p>

All mainstream training (that is, programs not restricted to people with disabilities), for example TAFE courses. This includes programs that accommodate people with disabilities through the provision of aids such as;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
audio recorders</li>
			<li>
monitors</li>
			<li>
other equipment or environmental modifications, or</li>

make concessions such as allowing unscheduled breaks or allowing the course to be completed at participant's own pace</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Training which is designed specifically for people with impairments, that is, where it is a prerequisite for acceptance into the course that the customer has a disability</li>
		<li>
Training programs that provide additional assistance to people as part of the program, solely because of their medical impairments, for example Disability Employment Services (DES)</li>
		<li>
Mainstream labour market programs. An understanding of the educational and vocational training available is essential</li>

<p>The concept of training extends to the types of work in which the customer has potential to perform.</p>
