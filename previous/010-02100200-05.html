<p>Leila is an ABSTUDY boarding student studying at Ipswich Girls Grammar. Leila is selected to attend the Queensland School Sport Basketball State Championships representing the Metropolitan West School Sport Girls basketball team.</p>

<p>During the school term, Leila will travel from Ipswich Girls Grammar to the Gold Coast to participate in the QLD School Sport Basketball State Championships, which runs over 5 days.</p>

<p>Jared, Leila's parent, will be travelling via private motor vehicle from their home address in Mount Marshall to the Gold Coast, via Ipswich Girls Grammar to pick up Leila. Leila and Jared will stay 4 nights on the Gold Coast to participate in the event. They will then travel back to Mount Marshall via Ipswich Girl Grammar to drop Leila back at the term address.</p>

<p>As Leila is representing the school or attending a school related activity at a location other than the term address, we regard it as a temporary change in study location. The study location is considered to have changed temporarily to the Gold Coast. Jared would be eligible for SPV travel to attend the event on the Gold Coast. In this scenario, it is Jared who is the approved ABSTUDY traveller.</p>

<p>As the permanent home is in Mount Marshall and the event is on the Gold Coast, the major routes between these locations pass through Ipswich, so it is reasonable and practical for Jared and Leila to travel together in the same vehicle.</p>

<p>When they reach the Gold Coast, Jared would be eligible for FAA to cover accommodation during the event, however Leila's accommodation is not covered under FAA.</p>

<p>While it may be reasonable for Leila and Jared to share accommodation while at the Gold Coast, if there is an additional charge for Leila to share the accommodation with Jared, this additional charge will not be covered by FAA.</p>

<p>Tamika is an ABSTUDY student from Aurukun, who intends to study at Peace Lutheran College, a secondary boarding school in Cairns.</p>

<p>In October, Tamika requested ABSTUDY Fares Allowance to attend a Year 7 enrolment interview with the new prospective school. This request was approved under the Orientation Travel entitlement and Tamika and their parent, Irene travelled from Aurukun to Cairns to undertake the interview process.</p>

<p>In January, just prior to the commencement of the school year, Tamika was invited to attend a Year 7 boarding orientation, enrolment and transition day to walk through the boarding school environment and familiarise themselves with the new study location.</p>

<p>A new Orientation travel request for the same school was submitted.</p>

<p>Tamika has had one previous Orientation travel request to attend Peace Lutheran College for an enrolment interview. Tamika is eligible for FAA, there is no limit on Orientation Travel.</p>

<p>A secondary school may require prospective students to attend interviews, or other selection processes, in the years prior to the student commencing. These processes can include screening or selection interviews as part of the offer of a scholarship. This is acceptable and the student can be approved as long as&#58;</p>

the secondary school or boarding facility provides a reasonable explanation as to why the selection process needs to occur so early, and</li>

<p>Yasmin is an approved ABSTUDY secondary boarder attending Ipswich Girls Grammar in Queensland.  She has been selected to attend Queensland (QLD) School Sport 16-18 years Basketball State Championships, representing the Metropolitan West School Sport Girls basketball team.  The event is being held in week 5 of Term 3.</p>

<p>Yasmin is required to travel from Ipswich Girls Grammar (term address) to Gold Coast to participate in the QLD Basketball State Championships.</p>

<p>Her Mother (parent) would like to support her and is travelling from their home address in Mount Marshall, Qld to Ipswich Girls Grammar via private motor vehicle.  She is going to pick up Yasmin from the school &amp; travel together from Ipswich Girls Grammar to Gold Coast.  Her mum has also offered to transport other students to the event.</p>

<p>Yasmin and her mum will need to stay 4 nights on the Gold Coast to allow Yasmin to participate in the event.   </p>

<p>They will then travel back to Ipswich Girl Grammar in the Mother’s car. Yasmin plus the other students will remain at the school.  Her Mother will continue her journey and return to Mount Marshall (home address).</p>

<p>Yasmin has accessed 2 other special purpose visit travels for sporting events in the calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility for fares allowance is as follows&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Yasmin can access fares allowance for up to three special purpose visit events events (excluding NAIDOC and graduation) per calendar year (for a reasonable number of approved travellers per event). She has already used two, so is able to access one more. </p>

<p>Yasmin is representing the school at an event that is at a location other than the term address, it is regarded  as a temporary change in study location. The study location can be considered to have changed temporarily to the Gold Coast. Therefore, Yasmin’s Mother is eligible for a return journey under Special Purpose Travel to attend the event at the Gold Coast. </p>

<p>As the permanent home is in Mount Marshall and the event is on the Gold Coast, the two major routes between these locations both pass through Ipswich, so it is reasonable and practical for the parent and Yasmin to travel together in the same vehicle.  Yasmin does not need to use a special purpose visit travel journey due to this reason, and it’s only the Mother who is the approved ABSTUDY traveller.   </p>

<p>When they reach the Gold Coast, ABSTUDY can be used to pay for the parent’s accommodation during the event (under Chapter 90.7.3). </p>

<p>ABSTUDY cannot be used to pay for Yasmin’s accommodation. The boarding school bears responsibility for her accommodation costs during the term when the student is undertaking part of the school curriculum, as the school is already being paid ABSTUDY to provide Yasmin with accommodation during the term.  While it may be reasonable for Yasmin and her Mother to share accommodation whilst in the Gold Coast, ABSTUDY can only be used to pay for the accommodation cost for the parent. If there is an additional charge for the students to share the accommodation with the parent then the school is responsible for paying this additional charge.</p>

<p>Nahem is an approved ABSTUDY secondary boarder attending St Teresa’s Catholic College in Abergowrie, Queensland.  The school has organised a sporting event in the middle of the school holidays in Townsville and Nahem is requesting ABSTUDY to assist with fare allowance plus 5 nights accommodation and meals to attend.  His Mother also wishes to attend the event to support Nahem.</p>

<p>Nahem’s permanent home is on Murray Island and is needing to travel from that location to the sporting event in Townsville. </p>

<p>Nahem has accessed one other special purpose visit travel (SPV) for a school music event the calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility for fares allowance is as follows&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Nahem can access fares allowance for up to three special purpose visit events events (excluding NAIDOC and graduation) per calendar year (for a reasonable number of approved travellers per event). He has used one, so is able to access two more. </p>

<p>The event is organised by the school therefore, the Townsville location can be regarded as a’ temporary change of study location’ and Fares Allowance is available to cover the costs of a return journey for Nahem and his travel supervisors (if they are required) to travel from home to the event location.  Special Purpose Visit entitlements can be used for fares and accommodation for reasonable number of Nahem’s family members or community members to attend the event also.</p>

<p>Accommodation for Nahem at the event would not be covered as there are no provisions to cover overnight accommodation for secondary students under Chapter 90.7.3.  While it may be reasonable for some students to share accommodation with a family member with SPV entitlements, ABSTUDY can only be used to pay for the accommodation cost for the SPV traveller. If there is an additional charge for the students to share the accommodation, then the school is responsible for paying this additional charge.</p></td>

<p>Nioka is an approved ABSTUDY secondary student attending Rockhampton Girls Grammer in Queensland. Throughout the school term, she has been playing Rugby Union on weekends as part of a Under 15 girls team affiliated with a local sporting club.</p>

<p>Nokia is very talented and has been selected in a representative squad to attend a Rugby Union tournament organised by Queensland Rugby Union.</p>

<p>The tournament being run over 4 days in Brisbane and over the middle weekend of the school holidays.</p>

<p>Nioka accessed vacation travel under ABSTUDY to return home to Yorke Island, Queensland, for the school holidays.  She is now requesting fares allowance to travel to the tournament and home again.</p>

<p>Nioka has not accessed any other special purpose visit travel (SPV) in the calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility for fares allowance is as follows&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Nioka can access fares allowance for up to three special purpose visit events (excluding NAIDOC and graduation) per calendar year (for a reasonable number of approved travellers per event). She has the full three still available as none have been used. </p>

<p>Although, as the sporting even is not organised by the school, nor is she representing the school at the sporting event, she does not meet the requirements for special purpose visit travel.       </p>

<p>Additional assistance is also considered for the journey, in lieu of Fares Allowance, as non-school related sporting events are not able to be approved under ABSTUDY Additional Assistance. </p>

<p>While Nioka’s participation in the rugby carnival maybe viewed as a positive factor in their ongoing engagement with school, there is no provision to approve Additional Assistance for this activity under ABSTUDY policy.</p>
