<p><strong>System generated text on the Account Payable letter</strong></p>

<p>The system generated text on the Account Payable (<strong>OPAOD</strong>) screen is mostly unprotected. This allows the user to give a more suitable reason for the debt, <strong>where appropriate</strong>.</p>

<p>The debt reason is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Ensure it is entered in the free text area on the <strong>OPAOD</strong> screen.</p>

<p><a href="../debts/107-04010030-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Debt_reason_cod">Table 2</a> contains examples of the text that the system will generate.</p>

<p>When the system generates text, the below message will show&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
'Check that default text is appropriate'</li>
		<li>
Press [<strong>Enter</strong>]. The message <strong>M5179</strong> will show, 'Press Enter to confirm the Advice details'</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check the system generated text and amend customer information and/or dates so it is correct. For example, the date populated in the system generated text for incarcerated customers will need to be changed from the debt DOV to the date the customer was incarcerated.</p>

<p>A decision maker may consider the tone of the default text is not appropriate for a particular case. Staff must check that the default text is appropriate in the circumstances, and apply the plain English principles set out below when entering free text.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> <a href="../debts/107-04010030-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Examples_of_pla">Table 3</a> contains a list of examples, which aim to illustrate how these principles should be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Plain English principles for entering free text on the Account Payable letter</strong></p>

<p>Add a few lines of text to &lt;<strong>DEBT REASON</strong>&gt; explaining why the debt occurred. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the debt period is now auto-populated under <strong>Details of your debt with us</strong>. It is no longer necessary to add the debt period in the <strong>free text</strong> field.</p>

<p>Use simple empathetic language.</p>

<p>When adding the reason for the debt, apply these principles&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Do not</strong> use accusatory language, for example 'You failed to'</li>
		<li>
Use plain English. This means&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
keep it simple</li>
			<li>
only include relevant information</li>
			<li>
keep sentences short, be concise</li>
			<li>
use words with no more than 2 syllables (where possible)</li>
			<li>
<strong>do not</strong> use jargon or acronyms</li>
			<li>
write in a friendly but professional manner</li>
			<li>
check spelling and grammar</li>
			<li>
capitalise letters only where required (for example, Reserve Bank of Australia)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The system generated text is a basis for the letter. Staff must add the relevant customer information, such as the name of the employer or the period of employment</li>
		<li>
Where the system generated text is determined to be sufficient, the inclusion of the auto populated (system generated) debt start and debt end date is acceptable</li>		</ul>
