<p>If a claim activity already exists, check claim has been indexed correctly. If the claim has not been indexed correctly, re-index the claim in <strong>Customer First</strong> using the correct details.</p>

<p><strong>Date of receipt&#58;</strong> Claims must always be coded and processed using the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010160-01.html">correct date of receipt</a>. For scanned claims, this date can sometimes differ from the 'capture date' used to confirm the date when the form was scanned. Confirm the correct date in Customer First using<strong> Workspace &gt; New Document Tools - Digitisation &gt; Document Tools</strong>. Selecting this provides a search for all documents in the ECRM Environment and displays both the 'date of receipt' and the 'capture date'.</p>

<p>The start date for FTB is generally not the same as the date of receipt of the claim due to backdating provisions. FTB may be backdated to 1 July of the relevant financial year or back to the date of birth of the child.</p>

<p>If the child is not listed, search for child via Link Child (<strong>LCH</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>Ensure that a thorough search has been completed to find any existing child record. This will minimise the risk of creating multiple records. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07030010-01.html">Searching for a customer on the system</a> for further details.</p>

<p><strong>Adopted children</strong></p>

<p>If the child was not previously known to the customer or linked on the customer's record, create a new child record and Customer Reference Number (CRN), even if a CRN already exists, and link the new record to the adoptive parent. This protects the privacy of the adoptive parent, birth parent and the child. Follow up action to avoid multiple records will still need to be taken on the previous child record. See <a href="../families/007-07010010-03.html">Claiming payments for children entrusted to care as part of the process of adoption or a surrogacy arrangement</a>. Record the previous child CRN in the claim <strong>DOC</strong> on the adoptive parent's record for audit, data quality and QOL check purposes.</p>

<p>If a new child record is created, no information about the adoptive parent or child (including CRNs) is to be noted on the birth parent or previous carer's record.

<p>If the claim spans current and previous financial years a separate claim may be required for each financial year. A Centrelink Lump Sum will be automatically created to assess entitlement if it is identified that <strong>potential</strong> eligibility exists for a previous financial year.</p>

<p>If an early claim has been lodged and the child was born/adopted in the previous financial year but the proof of birth/adoption and extra details are lodged in the following financial year, provided this is within 28 days of the child's expected date of birth/entry into care, the FTB claim is to be assessed from the birth/care date. <strong>Do not</strong> make the CLK LSC (FTB/ASS-AIU activity) not effective. A lump sum claim is not required in this circumstance.</p>

<p>If FTB was cancelled in the previous financial year, restore if criteria is met. See <a href="../families/007-07090030-01.html">Restoration of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if FTB is assessing for a previous year not claimed, FTB for the previous year is to be made not effective within the current year activity on the FTB Status Override (<strong>FYSO</strong>) screen&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
code the <strong>Start Date</strong> and <strong>End Date</strong> fields with the dates of the previous financial year (For example, 1 July XX - 30 June XX)</li>
		<li>
update the <strong>Status</strong> to '<strong>NEF</strong>' (Not Effective)</li>

If the customer subsequently makes a claim for the previous financial year, the entry on the <strong>FYSO </strong>screen will need to be deleted or changed to enable the claim to be assessed appropriately</li>
