<p>Batchelor College delivers an Associate Diploma in Indigenous Language course via a combination of external study and intensive on-campus residential schools. Approximately 75 students undertake four 10 day residential schools during the academic year. Batchelor College submit an ABSTUDY Submission for Away From Base Activity Funding form (SY034) for Away from Base assistance for meals and accommodation for the residential schools. Batchelor College request that Services Australia pay travel allowance to each participant for the period of the residential school because their administrative person will be on leave for the first residential school and cannot organise a residential expenses package.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The activity would not be approved for Away from Base funding without inclusion of a residential expenses package for the cost of meals and accommodation.

The University of Technology advises that they cannot arrange a residential expenses package for individual students in multiple locations.</p>

This course is a one year enabling course for alternative entry into mainstream courses. The testing programme is a two day activity. Monash has lodged an ABSTUDY Submission for Away From Base Activity Funding form (SY034) seven weeks prior to the activity and is seeking assistance for meals and accommodation costs for students. The activity meets all the approval criteria, except Monash has advised that it cannot provide a residential expenses package for students because it has not had time to make the necessary arrangements. Monash has requested that assistance for meals and accommodation be paid directly to the students.</p>
