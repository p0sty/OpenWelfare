accurately guide decisions about portability, and</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the Portability Script cannot be run for child-only absences, Child Care Subsidy, ABSTUDY, Farm Household Allowance, Double Orphan Pension or non-income tested Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) holders.</p>

<p>Only issue the Pre Departure - Portability (XOB101) letter if the customer is definitely leaving Australia and has specifically requested a letter.

<p>As well as the portability rules, <strong>most</strong> payments require a customer to remain an Australian resident to continue to qualify for payment. If they leave Australia to live overseas, qualification is lost on departure as they are no longer an Australian resident.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this does not apply to people receiving Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP), (for customers exempt from the ongoing residence requirement), <strong>unless</strong> they are receiving the payment because they are a refugee and have a qualifying residence exemption (that is, they do not qualify for payment under the usual rules such as 10 years residence in Australia but rely on the refugee visa for qualification). Customers who have qualified for Age or DSP under these exemptions are not entitled to payment if they leave Australia to live overseas.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Before running the Portability Script - Departures and Returns identify if the carer or care receiver will be travelling overseas without the carer continuing to provide care. If this is the case, as respite will occur, check the Absences Enquiry (<strong>ABCE</strong>) screen to calculate manually when respite will be fully depleted.</p>

<p>Where respite applies, insert the day following the last date of respite when the script stops to ask <strong>'Do you know or the customer know of any event that will happen and cause them to lose entitlement to Carer Payment/Carer Allowance before dd/mm/yyyy?'</strong> This date will appear in the letter issued when the script is finalised. Consider respite provisions independently and code manually where applicable. If the care receiver is going overseas without the carer, record the absence on the <strong>ABCE</strong> screen.</p>

<p>There is a current system limitation, which continues to count Temporary Cessation of Care (TCC) after expiration of portability. Where the carer's payments will suspend after 42 days the TCC end date should reflect only 41 days if care is provided on the day of departure. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, accept care was provided on the date of departure and TCC will commence from the following day. Code respite with start date equal to day after departure and end date equal to the end of the limited portability period. Therefore, the TCC period is 41 days, provided the carer has this number available.</p>

<p>Respite provisions do not apply when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the carer is travelling overseas with the care receiver, or</li>
		<li>
the carer receives CA and is travelling by themselves, but the care receiver is a child and the child is remaining with the carer's partner. Respite will still apply to CP in these cases. Code these absences using the 'child with partner' code '<strong>CWP</strong>' which will calculate a respite absence for CP but not CA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Respite provisions apply when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the carer is leaving Australia and an adult care receiver is remaining in Australia. <strong>Make sure respite is applicable and not cessation of care altogether</strong></li>
		<li>
the care receiver is going overseas without the carer</li>
		<li>

<p>The script will ask the Service Officer to select all payments they want assessed. All payments received by the customer will usually be preselected.</p>

<p>The following payments may be preselected&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Supplements (for example, Energy Supplement)</li>
		<li>
Add-ons (for example, Rent Assistance)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check they are eligible for the preselected payment(s). Some payment types may need to be removed from the list (for example, if not grandfathered for Energy Supplement) using the <strong>Add or Remove Payments</strong> function of the script.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Energy Supplement grandfathering provisions apply for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers and Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) holders. An overseas absence of longer than the allowable portability period for these payments means the customer will not be eligible for Energy Supplement if they reclaim FTB or CSHC when they return to Australia.</p>

<p>Once the options are chosen, the script will prompt the Service Officer to ask questions based on their record, departure dates and country of destination.</p>

<p>If they are leaving Australia for more than their available portability period, DSP may be payable if they are&#58;</p>

terminally ill</li>
		<li>
assessed as meeting the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, or</li>
		<li>
going to an agreement country that covers DSP</li>
		</ul>
<p>If they are noted on the Medical Conditions Details (<strong>MC</strong>) screen as manifestly qualified (excluding conversion CNV) or assessed under the 'no future work capacity' (NWC) portability provisions on the Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) screen, the script will automatically assess portability accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is manifestly qualified for DSP and is advising of a departure after the departure, they may not be eligible for indefinite portability under NWC provisions. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03120040-01.html">Assessment for Disability Support Pension customers going overseas under the no future work capacity portability provisions</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the script prompts the Service Officer to enquire whether they want to be assessed under the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Service Officers must inform the customer&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
this assessment requires a full review of their DSP qualification under current impairment tables (this means it is possible that as a result of the review, the customer will no longer qualify for DSP and their payment will be cancelled)</li>
		<li>
if they do not wish to undergo a DSP Medical Review, for assessment under the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, they will be assessed under regular portability rules</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a customer who is manifestly eligible for DSP does not need to undergo a full medical assessment.</p>

<p>Medical information may be required if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are going to an agreement country that covers DSP, and</li>
		<li>
their payment will cease either on departure or during their absence. For example, they are a former resident or a refugee departing Australia to live overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>If they will <strong>definitely return to Australia within their available portability period</strong> (usually <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03120000-01.html">4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period</a>) <strong>and DSP will be payable for the whole absence</strong>, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Updating_record_Step03">Step 3 in Table 4</a>. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if they have indicated the reason for travel may be for an approved reason, assessment can be made under those provisions even if there are sufficient days of general portability remaining for the planned travel. See <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Other_rules_to_Step01">Step 1 in Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>If they have already been <strong>assessed as terminally ill, or satisfying the</strong> 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, no medical assessment is required, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Updating_record_Step04">Step 3 in Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>If they are manifestly eligible for DSP, but have not previously been assessed for indefinite portability (NWC is not already coded on the <strong>RSCD</strong> screen), <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determining_cir_Step04">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

<p>If they (not a refugee or former resident) indicate they are terminally ill, or wish to be assessed under the 'no future work capacity' portability provisions, <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Determining_cir_Step03">go to Step 3</a></p>

<p>PP <strong>and/or</strong> Family Assistance Act payment.</p>

<p>PP customers who are subject to compulsory mutual obligation requirements have an automatic exemption from these requirements if they are payable whilst absent overseas. If they have an interview scheduled during their absence, reschedule it for a date after their return to Australia.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Tell them about the procedure for <a href="../separated-parents/277-51190000-01.html">Reconciliation of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)</a>, and</li>

<p>They may have to continue to update their income estimate. Even though they are leaving to live overseas, their estimate must include <strong>all</strong> income they will earn during the entire income year, including any <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03040060-01.html">foreign income</a>.</p>

<p>If they have returned to Australia after an absence that resulted in their PP, Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Subsidy (CCS) being stopped for portability reasons, then PP, FTB or CCS is not payable for any reason if they leave Australia again within 6 weeks of their latest return to Australia.</p>

<p>The script will normally pick this up as long as the previous absence is recorded. If PP or FTB is cancelling for this reason and the Service Officer believes they should be payable, the problem could be incorrect recording of residence, arrivals or departures. Code the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>), Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) and/or Customer Advised Travel Details (<strong>RSCD</strong>) screens.</p>

<p>Absences on the <strong>RSIM</strong> screen provided by the Department of Home Affairs cannot be amended. If they dispute an absence from Australia, the CIS must follow up.

<p><strong>Give the customer the correct advice</strong> about whether they will lose entitlement before they leave Australia or while they are overseas.</p>

<p>The Portability Script does not assess if a customer will remain qualified during their absence, so when a customer calls to advise they are travelling overseas, it is essential to look at their situation. Determine if they will lose entitlement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before they leave Australia or</li>
		<li>
while they are overseas</li>
		</ul>
<p>If they will lose entitlement, when the script asks if any circumstance will result in loss of entitlement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
answer '<strong>Yes</strong>', and</li>
		<li>
advise the date and a brief reason</li>
		</ul>
<p>The script will use this information in the XOB101 letter, which may be issued, if required, to give the person the correct date of cancellation. They must be manually advised of the reason for the cancellation during the portability interview.</p>

<p>If they are changing payment types before going overseas (for example now on PPS but will be on JSP before departure), use the <strong>Add or Remove payments</strong> button to select a different payment type.</p>

<p>The script will make a decision based on the choice of payment and give them correct information based on this payment type.</p>

<p><strong>Important changes to consider include&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Reporting and Employment Income&#58; A 2 weekly reporting customer will be re-profiled as a notification reporter once the departure date is reached. The system will issue any entitlement calculated for the prior period. If they have employment income to declare before their departure, they must report their income on the business day before departure so they do not incur an overpayment. They will not be required to report while overseas unless they have overseas earnings. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-03.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for more details</li>
		<li>
PP customers may lose eligibility due to the age of their youngest child. If their youngest child is turning 6 (PPP) or 8 (PPS), their PP will stop regardless of the portability period unless they are eligible to transfer to another payment which is portable for that absence</li>
		<li>
If a care receiver is temporarily leaving Australia, respite may apply to the carer's payment</li>
		<li>
If a medical certificate ends</li>
		<li>
Make sure all customers understand if they have to contact when they have returned to Australia</li>

			<ul>			<li>
The Portability Script - Departures and Returns will code the person's departure, <strong>however</strong> the departure will not be assessed until Home Affairs confirms they have left Australia</li>
			<li>
In some circumstances, their departure may not be coded immediately but a review will be created by the script on the Future Activity List (<strong>FAL</strong>) screen. When the review comes due and is received via WLM, re-run the Portability Script - Departures and Returns, which will ask if the Service Officer wants it to code the absence defaulting to 1 of 4 options, based on the previously collected information. If their details have not changed, select 'Next' and it will pick up the data <strong>DOC</strong> and automatically record the travel details provided on the <strong>RSCD</strong> screen</li>
			<li>
If they leave Australia more than 3 days either side of the date advised (and recorded by the script) the country of destination will be recorded as '<strong>XX</strong>' ('Unspecified'), even if they have provided details of their destination country</li>
			<li>
If they are receiving a restricted payment (Disability Support Pension (DSP), JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy, ABSTUDY or Special Benefit (SpB)), and change their departure date by more than 3 days, any approved reason for the absence will not be recorded. The system will place '<strong>OTH</strong>' in the <strong>Code</strong> field, which will cause payment to suspend on departure (or after 4 weeks in 12 months for DSP). The reason for this is that the customer's approval may no longer be relevant, therefore they <strong>must</strong> advise of changes to their departure dates so the reason for approval remains valid. It is therefore important to advise them to tell Services Australia if they change their date of departure</li>
			<li>
If the customer has already left Australia and the departure is on the <strong>RSIM</strong> screen, but they disagree with the departure date, see <a href="../australians-overseas/061-02010000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Investigating_a">Table 6</a></li>

<p><strong>Customer advises of alternative travel date</strong></p>

<p>The date of departure and arrival on the <strong>RSIM</strong> screen is the date the customer passes through Australian customs, as advised via the Immigration Datalink.</p>

<p>Portability rules apply according to the date recorded on the <strong>RSIM</strong> screen, therefore if a customer did not actually travel on that date, they may be disadvantaged by the date of advised through the datalink. In these cases, a customer may request an update to their travel date.</p>

<p>This most often occurs when the customer passes through customs on the evening of one day, but the flight departs the following day. See Resources for an example. It may also occur when a person travels on a cruise.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the customer cannot request a change to the departure date before leaving Australia, even if they believe the booked flight time may meet this situation.</p>

<p>Is the customer advising of an alternative date because they have travelled on a cruise?</p>
