<p><strong>Lump sum agreement, Notional Assessment (partial offset), Child Support collect, Modified Disbursement Method</strong></p>

<p>Agreement is for periodic payments, plus lump sum payment that is to be offset against 50% of the amount payable under the private child support agreement.</p>

<p>Remaining lump sum payment at the start of the financial year is $46,800 (this amount will not be transmitted to Centrelink).</p>

<p>Agreement annual rate for whole financial year is $10,000.</p>

<p>Notional Assessment annual rate for whole financial year is $5,000.</p>

<p>After crediting of lump sum, remaining amount payable is Child Support collect.</p>

<p>The Child Support collect amount received is $7,000. This includes payment of arrears for the previous financial year. In the first 6 months of the financial year Child Support collects $4,000.</p>

<p><strong>Notional assessment</strong></p>

<p>$5,000 pa / 365 = $13.69</p>

<p>$13.69 x 365 = $4,996.85</p>

<p><strong>Agreement entitlement</strong></p>

<p>$10,000 pa / 365 = $27.39</p>

<p>$27.39 x 365 = $9,997.35</p>

<p>This is the amount payable under the agreement for the financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Lump sum amount offset against private child support agreement</strong></p>

<p>$9,997.35 x 50% = $4,998.67</p>

<p><strong>Recalculating the rate under the Modified Disbursement Method</strong></p>

<p>The next 5 steps will be constantly recalculated throughout the financial year. To demonstrate this, the next 4 steps have been divided into assessment during the year and assessment after the end of the financial year.</p>

<p><strong>Agreement received to January</strong></p>

<p>The value of the lump sum apportioned for the financial year will remain unchanged. The amount of child support received will need to be annualised under the Modified Disbursement Method.</p>

<p>Child Support collects $4,000 in the first 6 months of the financial year.</p>

<p>This is above the $2,499.34 that Child Support was required to collect.</p>

<p>The extra $1,500.66 is arrears and needs to have the notional factor applied.</p>

<p>= $4,996.85</p>

<p>This is $2,001.33 ($7,000 - $4,998.67) above what Child Support was required to collect.</p>

<p>The extra $2,001.33 is arrears and needs to have a notional factor applied to it.</p>
