a continuous PPL period of up to 12 weeks, plus</li>
		<li>
30 Flexible PPL days</li>

<p>Customers will be eligible for Flexible PPL if they have met the eligibility requirements to receive the PPL period. <a href="../families/007-09020010-01.html">Eligibility for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) as a primary claimant for children born or entering care before 1 July 2023</a>.</p>

		<li>
primary claimants that are not eligible for a PPL period due to transferring it to a secondary claimant</li>
		<li>
claimants that are not eligible for the PPL period due to losing their Newly Arrived Resident’s Waiting Period (NARWP) exemption between the child’s date of birth/entry into care and the PPL period start date</li>

<p>Once a customer’s eligibility is determined, they will have a balance of&#58;</p>

up to the number of Flexible PPL days the primary claimant has given permission for another person to claim, if they are a secondary claimant</li>

<p>To be eligible to get Flexible PPL on a day nominated by the customer, the customer must, on the nominated date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have a PPL child born or entered care before 1 July 2023</li>
		<li>
be the primary carer of the PPL child</li>
		<li>
not be working (they can be on paid or unpaid leave).<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> exemptions apply for work performed for permissible purpose and Keeping in Touch (KIT) days.

meet Australian residence requirements, and</li>

have completed the Flexible PPL declaration</li>

they or another person are being paid PPL for the same child</li>
		<li>
they are receiving or have been paid Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) for the child</li>
		<li>
is before or during their or their partners PPL period (even if they are ineligible for the PPL period e.g. returned to work during the PPL period).

		<li>
is before the child’s date of birth/adoption</li>
		<li>
is after the child’s second birthday/anniversary of adoption</li>

<p>In most cases, customers cannot nominate dates that are more than 42 days in the past. Exceptions apply for customers that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in limited circumstances (such as to correct an unfavourable decision that has been reviewed)</li>
		<li>
have claimed a Flexible PPL day within the required timeframe, however the claim/ activity was not finalised in time</li>

<p>When claiming a Flexible PPL day the customer must declare via the Flexible PPL Declaration that they met or will meet the eligibility requirements on the claimed date. The declaration is located in the&#58;</p>

<p>Before the payment is generated, the customer’s residence and primary care status is checked. If the customer has&#58;</p>

asked to get Flexible PPL on a date they do not meet residency or care requirements, the day will be rejected</li>

advised they do not meet residency, or care requirements and have already been paid Flexible PPL for this day, it will be raised as an overpayment</li>

<p>When a day is rejected, it&#58;</p>

is returned to the balance of unclaimed days, and</li>

claim,</li>

meet eligibility criteria, and</li>

<p>Connected Flexible PPL days will be paid on the weekdays immediately following the last day of their PPL period. Customers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are not required to nominate specific dates for these days. They will be determined based on the customer’s PPL period end date</li>

<p>Connected Flexible PPL days will be delivered in the same way as their PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Exception&#58;</strong> The PPL employer paymaster role automatically ceases 52 weeks after the child’s date of birth/adoption. If the number of connected Flexible PPL days results in the continuous block of PPL extending beyond this date, the Flexible PPL days payable after this date will be delivered by Services Australia. The <a href="../families/007-20030334-05.html">Resources</a> page contains an example.</p>

<p>Customers can change the number of connected Flexible PPL days connected to their PPL period up to the day before their PPL period start date. They can do this by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
using the Parental Leave Pay Circumstances online service,</li>
		<li>
using the Flexible Parental Leave Pay Express Plus mobile application or</li>
		<li>
contacting Services Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the customer’s PPL period has commenced, they cannot increase the number of Flexible PPL days connected to their PPL period. However, they can decrease their number of connected days to the end of the PPL period to the date of notification. Any connected days prior to the date of notification cannot be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Connected Flexible PPL days will be paid after the PPL period as an unbroken continuous block.</p>

<p>The continuous block of PPL is broken if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
loses eligibility for PPL (for example they return to work), or</li>
		<li>
claims a Flexible PPL day that is on a Saturday or Sunday between 2 connected Flexible PPL days. If this happens the continuous block of PPL will be broken. The claimed days will not be changed, and will still be paid for the days nominated by the customer. However as they are no longer connected they will be delivered by Services Australia</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of return to work on connected Flexible PPL days</strong></p>

<p>If a customer returns to work before the end of the PPL period or connected Flexible PPL days, all connected Flexible PPL days after the return to work date will be reassessed. These days will be rejected or withdrawn and returned to the customer’s balance of unclaimed days.

<p><strong>Customer or partner receives an income support payment (ISP)</strong></p>

<p>PPL (including Flexible PPL days) is treated as ordinary income for determining eligibility and calculating the rate of ISP.</p>

<p>Customers may incur an overpayment of their ISP, if paid PPL for the same period. This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their PPL period, and/or</li>
		<li>
Flexible PPL day/s</li>

choosing a start date for their PPL period in the future, and/or</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Customer or partner receives family assistance</strong></p>

<p>FTB Part B is not payable on days that the customer or their partner receives PPL, including Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>If a customer advises of working on a Flexible PPL day and the day is withdrawn/rejected for a day in the past, the customer/partner may be entitled to FTB B on that day.</p>

<p>Customers should include PPL as part of their estimated taxable income used for family assistance payments.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support deductions</strong></p>

<p>Child support deductions (for example, payments of child support to another person) can be made from PPL, including Flexible PPL days for future days. Flexible PPL days that are not connected to the PPL period or are paid in arrears are not subject to child support payer deductions.

<p><strong>JobKeeper Payment</strong></p>

<p>The JobKeeper scheme ended on 28 March 2021</p>

<p>Customers could not receive JobKeeper Payment for the same period they received PPL. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>JobKeeper Payment did not preclude PPL entitlement. However, PPL did preclude entitlement to JobKeeper Payment for the same period.</p>

<p>It is the customer’s responsibility to advise their employer the dates they have claimed PPL, including their PPL period and Flexible PPL days. If a customer has queries or questions about JobKeeper payment tell them to discuss with their employer.</p>

<p>If a customer has multiple open (OPN) claims (for example, if they have a newborn or newly adopted child and have not finished receiving Flexible PPL for an older child), the benefit status line will reflect the most recent claim for PPL.

<p>It is recommended that customers with a NARWP exemption due to receiving an eligible payment connect all of their Flexible PPL days to the end of their PPL period. This will prevent them from losing eligibility if their exemption ends before they have claimed all of their Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>Customers need to receive an income support payment for each day from the child’s date of birth or entry into care until the day immediately before their PPL period start date for this exemption to apply.</p>
