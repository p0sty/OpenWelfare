<p>An online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for CCS/Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) cannot be submitted until all required supporting documents have been uploaded.</p>

<p>The exception is where the customer will provide bank account or Tax File Number details within 28 days. See <a href="../families/007-17103105-01.html">Exemption from providing Tax File Numbers when claiming Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a>.</p>

<p>When a paper claim is scanned to the customer's record, a Social Online Application (SOA) is created. Staff must manually code the information directly into the SOA using details from the paper claim.</p>

<p><strong>Service Centre Staff</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer lodges an offline (paper) claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Check all required evidence has been included with the claim</li>
			<li>
Scan the paper claim together with any supporting documents to the customer's record. This will generate an activity which will be allocated to an appropriately trained Service Officer for processing</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the customer is lodging evidence for a submitted claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Scan the document onto the customer's record</li>
			<li>
Access the customer's record in Process Direct</li>
			<li>
Select the <strong>Transactions</strong> icon and the <strong>Claim ID</strong> hyperlink. The <strong>Claim Application</strong> screen displays</li>
			<li>
Select the <strong>Tasks</strong> icon and update the status of documents required to <strong>Accepted</strong>. Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
			<li>
Select the <strong>Status</strong> icon. If <strong>all</strong> required documents have been provided and the <strong>Claim Status</strong> is On hold, update by selecting <strong>Edit</strong> and selecting <strong>In Process</strong>. Select <strong>Save</strong>.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the Service Officer changes the claim status the work item will be assigned to them. If they are not trained to process the claim, the Service Officer will need to return the claim to the pool. Go to the work items list and select <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/Multi_Select_icon.PNG" alt="Multi Selection" title="Multi Selection" />. Check the box for the relevant work item, and select <strong>Unassign</strong> to return the claim to the pool</li>		</ul>

<p>Most CCS online and ACCs are automatically assessed by applying the information provided with the eligibility criteria. Customers are advised of the outcome without the need for staff to manually review the claim.</p>

<p>Claims that require exception management, validation of selected data items, and new claims after a customer has been cancelled due to the second deadline will not auto assess. These claims will be allocated via Workload Manager to staff with the appropriate skill tag to manage.</p>

<p>All ACCS applications (Grandparent, Transition to Work, Temporary Financial Hardship and Child Wellbeing) require appropriately skilled staff to validate the information provided within the claim for the claim to be assessed.</p>

<p>Service Officers may need to re-index a claim if the customer has provided additional information after the claim is rejected, cancelled or there is an appeal. When the claim is re-indexed, it will include all the claim information.</p>

<p>CCS online claim re-index functionality is available to allow reassessment where the following criteria is met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The CCS Benefit Status is either <strong>Rej</strong>ected or <strong>Can</strong>celled. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>where the rejection or cancellation is at the child level, re-index functionality is not available</li>
		<li>
The CCS Claim has a status of <strong>Completed</strong></li>
		<li>
The customer has not withdrawn the original claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>To re-index an online claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the original claim via the <strong>Transactions</strong> icon or by <strong>Inbox</strong></li>

On the Transaction Summary (<strong>TS</strong>) screen, select <img src="../resources/images/process_direct_small/more%20options.png" alt="" title="" /> &gt; <strong>Re-Index Claim</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>This will generate a new work item using the claim information with a status of <strong>In Process</strong>.</p>

<p>As the work item is a change of circumstance activity (rather than a claim) it will display the following dates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Within the Claim Overview&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Date of Receipt&#58;</strong> the Deemed Date of Receipt (DDOR) is displayed</li>

			<li>
<strong>Receipt Date&#58;</strong> the DDOR is displayed</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Where a CCS claim is re-indexed&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The reasons outlining why the claim requires reassessment should be clearly recorded in Progress and Claim Assessment <strong>Notes/DOC</strong>s</li>
		<li>
When processing the recreated claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
check the Service Reason is CCP before selecting assess, and </li>
			<li>
ensure the outcome is correct before finalising, including checking any CCS arrears generated</li>
			<li>
See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08170000-01.html">Payment of arrears after reassessment and stopping a payment</a></li>		</ul>

<p>Where a CCS claim requiring reassessment has a <strong>Cur</strong>rent Benefit Status, re-index functionality is not available. For example, there is an incorrect rejection or period of cancellation at the child level. If a claim cannot be re-indexed to reassess entitlement, a CCS Social Online Application (SOA) can be indexed. Service Officers must manually input all relevant data to allow correct assessment. See <a href="../families/007-17103136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Regenerate_re_3">Item 3</a> for more details on indexing a CCS SOA.</p>

<p>For claims requiring reassessment, a CCS SOA can be indexed if the following circumstances present&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where reindex claim functionality is unable to be used due to the CCS Benefit Status. For example, when the customer has a <strong>Cur</strong>rent Benefit Status</li>
		<li>
A claim requires a backdated Date of Receipt (DOR). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> for claims or SOAs requiring a Deemed Date of Receipt (DDOR) more than 3 years in the past, see <a href="../families/007-17103136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Regenerate_re_4">Item 4</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>A CCS SOA should not be used&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in place of an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) where customers have requested to lodge a verbal claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>To index a CCS SOA&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the Process Direct home page and select <strong>SOA Shell</strong> under the <strong>Reports</strong> tab. Complete the following fields&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>Benefit Type&#58;</strong> Select Child Care Subsidy</li>
			<li>
<strong>Customer CRN&#58;</strong> Key the Customer Reference Number (CRN) without spaces</li>
			<li>
<strong>Date of Receipt&#58;</strong> Enter the date the claim was lodged as DD/MM/YYYY. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>the date of receipt of the original claim will display as the <strong>Submitted</strong> date. Use this date, <strong>not</strong> the <strong>Received</strong> date, to ensure claim correctness</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Where a CCS SOA is indexed, a CCP Claim Progress <strong>Note/DOC</strong> is auto-created. Record the reason, outlining why the claim requires reassessment, in Progress and Claim Assessment <strong>Note/DOC</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>When processing a CCS SOA&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
manually get the AIR data for each child in the claim to avoid gaps and ensure correct backdating of entitlement. While in the claim&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
take note of the postcode of the parent</li>
			<li>
from the child/ren record, go to the <strong>CIM</strong> table via the <strong>Super Key</strong> and select <strong>Add </strong></li>
			<li>
select <strong>Get AIR Data</strong> and <strong>Save</strong> the result, confirming the provisional AIR date of notification now matches the date of receipt (<strong>DDOR</strong>) of the claim. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the immunisation link should already be established but if linking issues present enter the customer postcode first then, if needed, include the Medicare number if available</li>		</ul>
		<li>
check the Service Reason is CCP before selecting assess, and </li>
		<li>
ensure the outcome is correct before finalising, including checking any CCS arrears generated</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08170000-01.html">Payment of arrears after reassessment and stopping a payment</a></li>
		<li>
If the incorrect outcome presents at <strong>Assessment Results</strong>, do not finalise the claim</li>
		<li>
Check the <a target="_blank" href="../Process-direct/ProcessDirect.html">Process Direct support page</a> for any current issues. If the issue cannot be resolved, escalate to ICT via Roxy Digital Assistant</li>

<p>A handoff process applies for situations where combined claims (CCS and FTB/PPL/DAP) are allocated to a Service Officer trained in CCS only. Families claims are to be processed in the order of submission by the customer, except where there is a CCS claim and a Families claim (e.g. FTB/PPL/DAP) on the record with the same submission dates. In this case the Families claim is to be processed first.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this handoff process is to be used <strong>only</strong> when staff do not have all the skills required to action a customer's Families claim first before actioning the CCS claim. Service Officers proficient in all the payment types are to process all claim types in the required order at the time the claim is first allocated.</p>

<p>Partner and child relationships must be reviewed/updated before starting to process a CCS claim.</p>

<p>Relationship updates must be done before selecting <strong>Process</strong>, otherwise significant errors will present during claim processing.</p>

<p>View/update details on the Transaction Summary (<strong>TS</strong>) screen in the following tables&#58;</p>

<p>CCS will reject for children who do not meet the immunisation requirements at the time of claim determination, unless an immunisation exemption is approved or the child is under 3 months.</p>

<p>Claims should not be rejected where the immunisation status is unknown because a link with the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) has not been established. Where a 'W' (wait) response is received from AIR, place the claim on hold for two business days. This allows time for AIR to attempt to manually complete the link, regardless of the age of the child.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
the partner is CCS current for a child that the customer is claiming for, or</li>
		<li>
an ex-partner was CCS current for a child that the customer is claiming for. For example, where the customers separation date is after their CCS claim DDOR</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Only one member of a couple may be CCS current for a child</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a customer has lodged a claim and the partner is already CCS current, the&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
current member of the couple will need to cancel their CCS entitlement for the child from a CCS Sunday following last attendance lodged to allow the customer to claim from the next CCS Monday, see <a href="../families/007-17103136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_claim_an_Step20">Step 20 in Table 3</a>, or</li>
			<li>
customer will need to withdraw their CCS claim for the child to allow partner to remain CCS current, see <a href="../families/007-17103136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_claim_an_Step20">Step 20 in Table 3</a></li>
			<li>
party who is to become/remain CCS current will need to contact their service provider(s) to ensure the child's enrolment and session reports are under their CRN. Contact with customer/partner is required to determine who remains CCS current</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the customer's start date (CCS Monday) is before the&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
ex-partner's separation date, the customer's CCS start date will need to commence from the CCS Monday following the separation, or</li>
			<li>
partner's cancellation date, the customer's CCS start date will need to commence from the CCS Monday following the cancellation</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The start date of the claim will need to be adjusted to a later CCS Monday&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Go to the <strong>Decision Unit</strong> line to display Change Child in CCS Claim (<strong>CCC</strong>). Select <strong>Edit</strong> on the relevant line to change the <strong>Start date</strong> to the CCS Monday following the partner's cancellation or separation date</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For example, where the customer and partner separated 5 February 2023 and the claim was submitted 13 February 2023, the DDOR applied by the claim is 23 January 2023. As the DDOR for the customer falls on a date where the ex-partner was CCS current for the child, the SR906 error correctly presents. To resolve this error, the CCC start date should be amended to 6 February 2023, which is the first CCS Monday following separation.</p>

<p>If the customer and partner are switching entitlement from one party to the other and the cancellation has already been recorded, but has not been recorded from a date other than the requested CCS Sunday, a SOA may be required to reassess the period between the date of cancellation and the CCS Sunday. See <a href="../families/007-17103136-03.html#bp03_tbl_Review_claim_an_Step20">Step 20 in Table 3</a>.</p>

new information is correct, contact the customer to confirm before accepting the new information, and advise the customer the impact this will have on their other payments</li>
