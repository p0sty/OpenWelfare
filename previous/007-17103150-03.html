<p><strong>ACCS claims/applications</strong></p>

<p>ACCS combined claims are processed by the ACCS Processing Team (ACCSPT). Staff have no delegation to process ACCS claims unless they are members of an ACCSPT. This includes combined CCS/ACCS claims where the ACCS component is embedded within the CCS claim.</p>

<p>The work item will be mapped to appropriately trained staff. If a Service Officer is allocated an ACCS work item they are not appropriately skilled to action, unassign and return it back to the national allocation pool.</p>

<p>This includes CCS claims with 'I do not want to be assessed for Additional Child Care Subsidy (Transition to Work)' in the claim details and have a TTW keyword. This may occur when a customer starts to claim CCS and ACCS TTW online, but change their response before submitting it. Pending system enhancements the ACCSPT will need to undertake extra checks.</p>

<p>Customers are required to have an active or current Job Plan or a Participation Plan (where applicable) for an ACCS (Transition to Work) application to be effective and eligibility to be determined. This <strong>must </strong>be entered into within 28 days of the application being lodged.</p>

<p>Customers receiving DSP must have an active <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090060-01.html">DSP Participation Plan</a> to be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>Customers with an active Job Plan for their income support payment, or an active voluntary Job Plan, do <strong>not</strong> need to enter into a new Job Plan for ACCS (Transition to Work).

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ACCS (Transition to Work) processing staff do not need to check for a Job Plan and it does not need to specify the ACCS (Transition to Work) activity.

<p>Upon submission of an ACCS (Transition to Work) application or claim, Process Direct will detect if the customer does not have an active Job Plan and will request they enter into a Job Plan within 28 days. Generally, there will be no requirement to issue a letter requesting a Job Plan.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> Customers are required to submit evidence before they can submit a combined CCS/ACCS (Transition to Work) claim (online or via the ACC). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> excludes CCS claims combined with FTB or PPL.</p>

<p>Customers can submit some CCS/ACCS claims and ACCS applications without uploading evidence for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
standalone ACCS applications (as it is considered a Change of Circumstances), or</li>
		<li>
CCS/ACCS claims combined with another families payment e.g. FTB or PPL. For these applications, customers are advised what evidence is required, and the due date, on their Receipt. This request is deemed a request for information, so a further request is not needed unless additional information is required</li>
		</ul>
<p>Expand the related documents by clicking the <strong>Show Documents</strong> icon and open the '<strong>text/html receipt</strong>' image. You may need to scroll across if there are several images on file.</p>

<p>This will open the receipt which presented to the customer when they submitted their online application, including evidence required and the timeframe in which it was to be provided.</p>

<p>Evidence <strong>must</strong> be provided&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for an ACCS (Transition to Work) application to be effective, and</li>
		<li>
to enable eligibility for ACCS (Transition to Work) to be assessed</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the customer is participating in more than one eligible ACCS (Transition to Work) activity, evidence is required for<strong> all</strong> activities included in the application, even if the activities are of the same type e.g. 2 paid work activities. If not provided for <strong>all</strong> activities, the application will be not effective. This is because the application is assessed as a whole, and not separated depending on evidence provided.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer later withdraws an activity from the application, evidence is no longer required for that activity to assess the claim, evidence is still required for all other activities. The provisional line for the withdrawn activity must be deleted from the TTW table and the decision clearly noted in the progress/finalisation <strong>DOC</strong>. See <a href="../families/007-17103150-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reviewing_the_c01_Step01">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Documents</strong> icon to display all documentation attached to the record.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> before requesting documents, review all evidence provided, and any evidence accessible on the customer's record which may be suitable to support the customer's application. This will ensure only one letter requesting documents is sent to the customer.</p>

<p>Where evidence has not been provided <strong>and</strong> has not been previously requested, issue a Q888 - Request for information - CCS and Additional CCS letter to request evidence for each of the ACCS (Transition to Work) activities. Where an ACCS application or claim requires evidence, the majority of applications or claims will request this as part of the application process. There is rarely a requirement to issue an initial request for evidence.</p>

<p>Evidence requirements need to be met for an effective claim and to determine an outcome. A claim or application cannot be given a rejection outcome when all outstanding evidence has not been provided. Where required evidence was lodged outside of the requested timeframe, but the claim has not yet been determined, it is still an effective claim and should be processed as normal (noting different rules apply for Job Plan/Participation Plan).</p>

<p>There may be circumstances where the timing limit has been reached previously, whether by means of prior ACCS (Transition to Work) or JETCCFA funding (for study activity only). This should be discussed with the customer to advise that if they choose to proceed with their application or claim, the outcome will likely be rejection. This information should be clearly documented in <strong>Progress Notes</strong>.</p>

<p>Where evidence has been provided, or may be accessible on the customer's record, confirm it meets the evidence requirements for each of the activities below&#58;</p>

<p>Study completed or commenced includes courses within Australia or overseas. For example, if a customer completed a Diploma in Education in New Zealand 5 years ago, a Diploma would be their highest level of study for the purposes of ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>The ten year time period is applied from the date the customer completed the higher level of previous study.</p>

		</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../families/007-17103150-05.html">Resources</a> page for external links used for verification. Although an institution may not be VSL and/or HELP approved, they are an approved institution if they are an RTO.</p>

<p>When Proof of enrolment does not contain all the required fields, staff may utilise approved websites on Resources and Educational Institution handbooks to confirm course start and end dates.</p>

<p>A course Letter of Offer issued by an Educational Intuition cannot be accepted as sufficient proof of enrolment. Further evidence confirming offer acceptance lodged collectively with a Letter of Offer may be considered if all minimum evidence requirements have been met.</p>

<p>People studying with Open Universities Australia&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Must provide the name of the Educational Institution they are registered with to complete a qualification level</li>
		<li>
If the customer is only studying units, they must provide evidence of the qualification they are studying towards, and evidence of undertaking the equivalent of least a 25 per cent study load to meet the part-time study requirements</li>
		<li>
If they are unable to provide evidence they are studying towards a qualification, they are not eligible for ACCS Transition to Work</li>
		<li>
Proof of enrolment requests evidence of both units and evidence of the qualification they are studying towards, there is generally no requirement to request further documentation</li>

<p>Full-time and part-time study may qualify, as long as it meets <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-17103151-05.html">the study levels for ACCS (Transition to Work)</a> at the secondary or preparatory level, or between levels 2 and 8 of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) study levels.</p>

<p>For ACCS (Transition to Work), the course does not need to be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
provided by a VET Student Loan (VSL) Approved Provider</li>
		<li>
provided by a Scholarship approved Institution, or</li>
		<li>
regarded as a VSL Approved Course</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a customer has periods of ACCS (Transition to Work) for full-time and part-time study, an assessment line will need to be recorded for each period.</p>

<p>If the customer is studying two courses at the same time, for example, Cert II and Cert III, the higher level course must be used for their application.</p>

<p>The Undergraduate Certificate may be used to transfer into an existing qualification at AQF levels 5, 6 or 7 and staff should process based on the most beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>For example, where a customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has no previous qualification, this should be considered an <strong>AQF level 5</strong> qualification, so as not to prohibit them from accessing further periods of ACCS (Transition to Work) at a later date due to the Step Up rule</li>
		<li>
has a previous qualification at level 6, the Undergraduate Certificate should be considered at Level 6 for any time limit not already exhausted, and a level 7 thereafter</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the customer has lodged an FA085 application form&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the Transition to Work (<strong>TTW</strong>) screen &gt; <strong>TTW Assessment</strong> table</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Add </strong>and complete all details from the information on the form</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Review evidence and confirm the educational institution and course are approved. See the <a href="../families/007-17103150-05.html">Resources</a> page for links to external organisations to verify institution and course details.</p>

<p>If the customer is studying with Open Universities Australia, they must provide evidence they are studying towards a qualification. Where the customer is enrolled in units only, the course cannot be considered an approved course of study or training for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p><strong>Is the course an approved course of study?</strong></p>

<p>The study load requirements for ACCS (Transition to Work) are the same as the study load requirements for income support payments for study activities. In some cases, study load may be recorded on the Proof of Enrolment.</p>

<p>If a customer meets the study load requirements for their income support payment, they will also meet the study load requirements for ACCS (Transition to Work). To be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work), the customer needs to be studying at least&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
25 per cent of the full-time study load to be considered part-time</li>
		<li>
75 per cent of the full-time study load to be considered full-time</li>
		</ul>
<p>The study load can affect the overall time limit for study. See the <a href="../families/007-17103150-05.html">Resources</a> page to view the approved activity time limits table.</p>

<p>If a customer meets the exceptional circumstances requirement of their income support payment, such as for Austudy where 66 per cent of the full-time study load is considered full-time, they would also be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work) for a full-time study activity. For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-04050040-01.html">Assessing eligibility for the 66% concessional study load for Austudy</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer is studying less than 25 per cent of the study load, they are not eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>Where the study load varies between part time and full time periods for the full course of study, the <strong>Activity Start Date</strong> and <strong>Activity End Date</strong> fields will need to be coded to reflect the full course start and end dates, respectively for each line. The <strong>Payment Start Date</strong> and <strong>Payment End Date</strong> are to be used to assess the relevant period of payment. For example, customer is studying a Bachelor degree which commenced 1 February 2017 and is anticipated to end 1 December 2020. Prior to the first semester in 2019, study is considered full time study, and from the first semester in 2019 ongoing, study is considered part time. To code the assessment on the<strong> TTW</strong> screen, a separate line is required for the differing study loads. The lines will need to be updated as follows&#58;</p>

<p>Full time line&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Activity Start Date</strong>&#58; 1 February 2017</li>
		<li>
<strong>Activity End Date</strong>&#58; 1 December 2020</li>
		<li>
<strong>Study Load</strong>&#58; full time</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment Start Date</strong>&#58; 2 July 2018</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment End Date</strong>&#58; 24 February 2019</li>
		</ul>
<p>Part time line&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Activity Start Date</strong>&#58; 1 February 2017</li>
		<li>
<strong>Activity End Date</strong>&#58; 1 December 2020</li>
		<li>
<strong>Study Load</strong>&#58; part time</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment Start Date</strong>&#58; 25 February 2019</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment End Date</strong>&#58; 14 December 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p>When calculating time limit, periods of part time study will need to be converted to full time equivalent (FTE) to ensure consistent calculation, for example 2 weeks of part time study = 1 week of full time study.</p>

<p>Further instruction on coding changes in study load is available in <a href="../families/007-19070952-01.html">Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work) change in circumstances and reviews</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer is undertaking two or more approved activities for ACCS (Transition to Work), the highest time limit available is applied. This is referred to as the Most Beneficial Activity Principle.</p>

<p>The system will have determined the most beneficial activity based on information recorded for each activity in the ACCS Transition to Work (TTW) Table. The hierarchy, based on the highest period being applied first is&#58;</p>

<p>1. Study</p>

<p>2. Training - vocational</p>

<p>3. Training - non vocational</p>

<p>4. Work - paid work, unpaid work (including a work experience placement or an internship) and setting up a business</p>

<p>5. Job search</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>&#58; Georgie is working and studying a Certificate III. As this type of study has the highest time limit, Georgie's study activity will be <strong>G</strong>ranted for ACCS (Transition to Work), and a 104-week time limit applied.</p>

<p>However, the Service Officer processing the application is responsible for ensuring the activities are recorded appropriately so the time limit applied will be of the greatest benefit to the customer.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, the activity selected for ACCS (Transition to Work) may not be appropriate or the most beneficial, requiring manual updates to the activity row(s) enabling the system to select the correct or most beneficial activity for ACCS (Transition to Work). For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Training, other program or volunteering was assessed by a Service Officer as not improving customer's work skills or employment prospects. In these cases, update the relevant row with an activity <strong>Start Date</strong> more than 28 days in the future</li>
		<li>
Customer is commencing study within 28 days, but has a work activity which has already commenced, therefore the system incorrectly identifies work as the most beneficial activity</li>
		<li>
Customers may be participating in an activity which has two components. For example, Self-Employment Assistance/New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) has components of training and setting up a business. Rather than recording solely as training, it could also have an additional component of work (setting up a business)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Do activity details need to be updated to apply the Most Beneficial Activity Principle?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>

<p>Where it was identified a customer received JETCCFA and/or ACCS (Transition to Work) for the level of study for which ACCS (Transition to Work) has been <strong>G</strong>ranted, the Grant Weeks may need to be manually updated.</p>

<p>The following formula is used to calculate remaining ACCS (Transition to Work) timing limit where JETCCFA was paid in the past&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Funding limit for AQF level <strong>minus</strong> JETCCFA weeks granted (converted to FTS equivalent) minus prior paid TTW weeks (converted to FTS equivalent) <strong>equals</strong> Eligible TTW Full-time remaining timing limit in weeks</li>
		</ul>
<p>To calculate the eligible ACCS (Transition to Work) full-time remaining timing limit&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Calculate the number of weeks for the same course AQF level that JETCCFA, and/or ACCS (Transition to Work) was previously granted, ensuring weeks are converted to full-time equivalent. For further assistance in determining periods of JETCCFA, see the <a href="../families/007-17103150-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link to the Business Processing Branch page. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> select the <strong>Child Care</strong> icon and check the <strong>Entitlement</strong> table to ensure non-payment periods are accounted for</li>
		<li>
Deduct the number of weeks from the full timing limit for the relevant AQF level, as below&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Secondary course / Preparatory course / Certificate II / Certificate III / Certificate IV / Diploma / Advanced Diploma or Associate Degree&#58; <strong>104 weeks for full-time study for each level of the AQF</strong></li>
			<li>
Bachelor Degree&#58; <strong>156 weeks for full-time study</strong></li>
			<li>
Bachelor Honours Degree / Graduate Certificate / Graduate Diploma&#58; <strong>104 weeks for full-time study</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Susie is studying part-time for a Certificate III course. However, Susie also received JETCCFA for 66 weeks of part-time study for a prior Certificate III course</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Calculate weeks of prior JETCCFA funding at full-time equivalent. As Susie previously studied at part-time, the number of weeks are divided by 2, i.e. 66 weeks part-time divided by 2 is equivalent to 33 weeks full-time<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the calculation of full-time equivalent does not result in a whole number, the figure can be rounded down</li>
			<li>
Minus the JETCCFA full-time equivalent weeks already received from the total number of ACCS (Transition to Work) funding for this type of study (104 - 33 = 71)</li>
			<li>
Susie has 71 weeks full-time ACCS (Transition to Work) funding</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>A determination will need to be assessed as to whether the JETCCFA weeks will impact the ACCS (Transition to Work) assessment and need to be deducted. Where the number of weeks already received for JETCCFA will not result in ACCS (Transition to Work) entitlement exceeding the study time limit, the JETCCFA weeks do not need to be deducted from the Grant Weeks, because the combined grant weeks are less than the maximum time limit for the activity.</p>

<p>For example, if the customer is due to finish their Cert II course in 6 weeks' time, yet had previously had 4 weeks of JETCCFA, the amount of JETCCFA will not have any bearing on the ACCS (Transition to Work) timing limit.</p>
