If a new maintenance group is required, an error shows on <strong>SWE </strong>after selecting Assess. Go to the <strong>MNGS</strong> screen and code the necessary updates</li>

In most cases, a customer will be given an automatic DMA period of 13 weeks (91 days) for a child from the relevant date of event. A manual workaround may be required to simulate a DMA period for the customer</li>
		<li>
In Process Direct, go to <strong>MNGS </strong>screen. Select the relevant child using the drop down option, go to Maintenance Action Results (<strong>MNMA</strong>) table. On <strong>MNMA</strong> table, if the DMA period has not stimulated correctly, escalate the case to the National ICT Referral Officer (NIRO).

<p>PPL/DAP is treated as income for ISP. Granting PPL/DAP may have resulted in a reduced ISP rate, an employment income nil rate period or ISP cancelling.</p>

<p>If PPL/DAP is granted from a date in the past, an ISP debt may have been calculated. Attempt to make one outbound contact to affected customers to discuss potential payment impacts claiming PPL/DAP will have on their income support payment. Where appropriate, the customer may change their nominated start date to another date in the future to prevent being overpaid their income support payment.</p>

<p>If contact is unsuccessful complete processing and action the debt shell. See <a href="../debts/107-04010000-01.html">General debt raising information</a>.</p>

<p>To enable ISP entitlement to be followed up at the end of the PPL or DAP period, in Customer First create a review<strong> DOC</strong> on the ISP customer's record using the Fast Note template <strong>Families</strong>&gt; <strong>Claims</strong>&gt; <strong>PPL/DAP income and ISP</strong>.</p>

<p>PPL is treated as income for ISP. Granting PPL may have resulted in a reduced ISP rate, an employment income nil rate period or ISP cancelling.</p>

<p>If PPL is granted from a date in the past, an ISP debt may have been calculated. Attempt to make one outbound contact to affected customers to discuss potential payment impacts claiming PPL will have on their income support payment. Where appropriate, the customer may change their nominated start date to another date in the future to prevent being overpaid their income support payment.</p>

<p>If contact is unsuccessful complete processing and action the debt shell. See <a href="../debts/107-04010000-01.html">General debt raising information</a>.</p>

<p>To enable ISP entitlement to be followed up at the end of the PPL period, in Customer First create a review <strong>DOC</strong> on the ISP customer's record using the Fast Note template <strong>Families</strong> &gt; <strong>Claims</strong> &gt; <strong>PPL income and ISP</strong>.</p>

<p>Add the appropriate PPL keyword and the payment type as per the keyword information provided on the Resources page in <a href="../families/007-17100603-05.html">Processing standalone and combined claims for family assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments</a>.</p>

<p>If the primary claimant is the biological father or partner of the birth mother and they have submitted a pre-birth claim, prior to processing, further checks must be undertaken to determine if the claimant meets the exceptional circumstances criteria, see <a href="../families/007-09020010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Primary_claiman_Step02">Step 2 Table 1 Eligibility for Parental Leave Pay (PPL) as a primary claimant</a>.</p>

<p>Attempts to contact the claimant should be made to determine if the claim has been incorrectly made (for example, customer meant to claim DAP instead of PPL).</p>

<p>Before calling, Desktop Electronic Messaging Capability (DEMC) may be used to advise the customer they will be receiving a phone call. See <a href="../self-service/133-05000000-01.html">Centrelink letters online and Electronic Messaging</a>. If the claim was incorrectly lodged, assist the claimant to withdraw the claim.

the FTB pre-birth claim more than 56 days after the child's expected date of birth&#58;</li>

the system assesses the claim as NEF-PCB/NEF-POB. As the customer has proof of birth a NEF-PCB/NEF-POB outcome is not appropriate</li>

<p></p>

<p>After finalising the pre-birth claim use the Add Newborn workflow to process the proof of birth. Go to via <strong>Workspace&gt; Claims Online&gt;Add Newborn</strong></p>

<p>If the customer has lodged other proof of birth contact them to collect all other post birth information. For PPL claims, see <a href="../families/007-07030020-03.html">Assessing Parental Leave Pay (PPL) claims</a>.</p>

<p>Use the Fast Note to record the claim outcome - auto text <strong>Families</strong> &gt;<strong> Claims</strong> and select the relevant claim outcome option.</p>

<p>For PPL claims when processing the 'Add newborn child' service, the system checks the nominated start date. It updates this to the date of birth if it is between the expected date and actual date of birth. This is the earliest possible start date for the child. Do not update <strong>if the customer lodged an incomplete FA081</strong>, contact them to collect the missing information.
