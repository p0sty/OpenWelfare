<p>This document outlines the steps to take when a customer advises they have purchased another residence or previously advised of selling a home with the intention to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate a new principal home with the proceeds. If they have since purchased another residence or built a new residence, previously exempt assets must be updated. It is important to determine whether they still own the previous residence or if they sold it.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Once a customer <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04070050-01.html">sells their principal home</a>, the portion of the proceeds which the customer intends to use to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate a new principal home are an exempt asset for up to 12 months.</p>

<p>If a customer purchases or starts to build a new home before selling their existing home, there are no sale proceeds to exempt until they sell their old home. Undertake an assessment to determine which property is their primary residence.</p>

<p>If the proceeds from the sale are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
held as a financial investment including a non-grandfathered account-based income stream, they are subject to deeming. If proceeds are invested elsewhere, they will be assessed according to usual Income Test rules</li>
		<li>
invested in a Cat 9 deemed account-based income stream, record the product on the <strong>SVDI</strong> screen with the Investment Type as '<strong>OTH</strong>'. This will enable deeming to apply to the adjusted account balance. Code the amount used to purchase a new principal home in the <strong>Assets Test Deduction Amt</strong> field. Once the customer has purchased the new home, or as they make progress payments on building a new home, update the <strong>Asset Test Deduction</strong> field.</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Extended_exempt">Extended exemption up to 24 months</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An extended exemption of the sale proceeds may, in some circumstances, happen for up to a maximum 24 months from the time of sale. Extended exemption applies if the property sold on or after 1 July 2007 and applies to all income support payments.</p>

<p>To gain an extended exemption of up to 24 months for the principal home sale proceeds, the customer must have a continuing intention to apply the proceeds of the sale to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate a new principal home and provide documentary evidence to support they have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
made reasonable attempts to obtain a new principal home, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
been making those attempts within a reasonable period after selling the principal home (that is, 6 months), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
experienced delays beyond their control in obtaining a new principal home</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer cannot meet <strong>any</strong> of the above criteria, they <strong>cannot</strong> gain an extended exemption on the principal home sale proceeds.</p>

<p>A customer meeting the extended exemption conditions is considered to be a homeowner during the extended exemption period.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Land purchased by the customer from the principal home sale proceeds, on which they intend to build a new principal home, may be exempt from the Assets Test. This applies whether the land is owned outright or mortgaged. The maximum total asset value to be exempt must not exceed the sale price of the former principal home. For example if the principal home sells for $250,000, only assets up to the value of $250,000 can be exempt, this includes the value of the land. The <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04070020-05.html">Resources</a> page has an example.</p>

<p>The property the customer temporarily occupies in this situation continues to be an assessable real estate asset (it is not assessed as their principal residence).

<p>If, after purchasing a new principal home, a customer still owns their previous principal home, the previous home must be assessed under the Assets Test.</p>

See the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04070020-04.html">References</a> page. This may be either a secured loan or an unsecured loan if the customer can demonstrate the loan is an encumbrance on that particular asset.

<p>The sale of home provisions <strong>cease</strong> once the customer has purchased their new principal home. If the customer has purchased their new principal home but does not move in immediately, the property becomes an assessable asset. The customer's homeowner status will be dependent on where they are currently living. If the customer is living in a home they own, this will become their principal home and they are a homeowner. If the customer is living in a home they do not own, they are a non-homeowner.</p>

<p>The temporary home vacation provisions cannot apply, as the customer has not previously resided in the new home. If a customer is unable to move in to their new home due to unusual circumstances beyond their control refer the case to Level 2 Helpdesk for advice. For example, customer is unable to move to their new home due to COVID-19 border closures.</p>
