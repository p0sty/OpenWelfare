<p>This document outlines when a non-pension customer and/or concession card holder needs to advise of a return to Australia, the action to be taken by Service Officers in a service centre or Smart Centre, and the effect on a customer's payments when they return to Australia.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a Centrelink customer or child leaves or returns to Australia through the Immigration Datalink. The portability of the payment is automatically assessed by the system, regardless of whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled.</p>

<p>Services Australia uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Immigration Datalink. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. Services Australia should consider applying the alternative dates, if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>In most cases, customers <strong>do not need to advise</strong> Services Australia they are leaving Australia temporarily or have returned from a temporary absence. However, there are situations when customers should advise of a departure before leaving Australia or contact when they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p>If a customer remains outside Australia after their payment has stopped for a <strong>portability related reason</strong>, continuation of payment on their return to Australia may be possible.

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) in addition to their primary payment, PES will suspend (EPF/SUS) if the primary payment suspends. PES cannot be restored if there is a gap in entitlement, the customer will need to reclaim PES. PES may need to be cancelled to allow restoration of the primary payment (if applicable).

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the customer is repeatedly absent from Australia for long periods with short returns to renew their portability, it may indicate that they are actually residing overseas.</p>

<p>For non-pension payments, the customer must remain an Australian resident to remain qualified. The Service Officer must be satisfied of this each time a customer leaves Australia, or payment should be cancelled immediately on departure. If an absence, or a period of multiple absences with short returns to Australia between the absences, exceeds approximately 3 years, continuing Australian residence is questionable.</p>

<p>If a customer whose payment has been suspended or cancelled returns to Australia after multiple absences, ensure they are still a resident of Australia before their payment is restored or re-granted. If payment is restored or re-granted, any future absences should be checked very carefully before making the portability decision to ensure that they customer is still an Australian resident.</p>

<p>Most customers do not have to remain in Australia for any minimum period before payment is portable again and, if the customer is paid a proportional rate, their rate will increase from the date of their return to Australia. However, some payments are affected by return rules and other payments may be affected by former resident rules.</p>

<p>Customers who cease to be Australian residents and lose entitlement to Centrelink administered payments will need to return to reside in Australia before they can lodge a proper claim for payment. They will need to be <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-06010010-01.html">assessed as an Australian resident</a> to qualify for payment.</p>
