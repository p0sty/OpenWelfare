<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_POA">POA, Guardianship Orders and Administration Orders</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>POA, Guardianship Orders and Administration Orders give people, or entities, the legal authority to act on behalf of someone else. The difference between these types of arrangements is the way in which a person has been appointed to act on behalf of another individual.</p>

<p>Authorised Representative arrangements give people the authority to act on behalf of someone else for Medicare purposes, but they are not legal documents.</p>

<p>For release of Medicare and PBS claims history information requests under POA see <a href="../your-health/011-40050000-01.html">Release of information for Medicare</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> POA and Authorised Representative arrangements are not transferable across the agency. See the 'Someone to deal with us on your behalf' page on the Services Australia website for specific programme requirements. The <a href="../your-health/011-40030000-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to this page.</p>

		<div class="block">
		<ul>		<li>
an<strong> individual</strong> can appoint someone as a <strong>POA</strong> to act on their behalf in specified circumstances</li>
		<li>
<strong>a court or tribunal</strong> can appoint someone to act as the <strong>legal guardian or administrator </strong>of an individual who is unable to manage all or some of their affairs due to accident, illness, disability or mental incapacity</li>
		</ul>
<p>POA, Guardianship Orders and Administration Orders will vary on a case by case basis. This means each new document needs to be considered in order to determine whether it allows a person to do business with the agency on behalf of someone else.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
POA documents sighted <strong>must</strong> be original or a certified copy of an original</li>
		<li>
Advance personal plans in the Northern Territory <strong>replaces</strong> enduring power of attorney</li>
		</ul>
<p>A POA drawn up in one state is acceptable nationwide for the purposes of Medicare, unless the POA clearly states it is restricted to the state of origin. If clauses are present in the POA, see <a href="../your-health/011-44015000-03.html">Escalation process for Medicare Eligibility</a>.</p>

<p>If a POA has been drafted in another country, it must be verified and confirmed by an Australian legal entity (lawyer, solicitor etc.). Written advice by the legal entity must state that the POA is acceptable in Australia and must accompany the POA document.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>The following is a list of definitions related to POA, Guardianship Orders, Administration Orders and Authorised Representative arrangements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>POA&#58;</strong> a written document given by one person to another authorising them to act for him/her on their behalf</li>
		<li>
<strong>Guardianship and Administration Orders&#58; </strong>a written document given by a court or tribunal appointing a legal guardian or administrator to act on behalf of an individual</li>
		<li>
<strong>Authorised Representative&#58;</strong> arrangements which allow a person to act on behalf of an individual for Medicare purposes who is unable to manage their own affairs or make decisions</li>
		<li>
<strong>Public Trustees&#58;</strong> are government departments established to provide a range of services to the public in their particular state or territory. The legal entity provides financial and administrative services to those who cannot manage their own affairs under Financial Management Orders (FMO) issued by a court or tribunal</li>
		<li>
<strong>Attorney&#58;</strong> the person authorised to act (also called donee)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Donor&#58;</strong> the person who has given the POA, that is, the person for whom another person is acting</li>
		<li>
<strong>Donee&#58;</strong> the person authorised to act (also called attorney)</li>
		<li>
<strong>Jointly and severally&#58;</strong> the attorneys can make decisions together or separately</li>
		<li>
<strong>Severally&#58;</strong> any one of the attorneys can make decisions independently of the other attorneys</li>

<p>Family and domestic violence is conduct that is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
violent</li>
		<li>
threatening</li>
		<li>
coercive or controlling</li>
		<li>
intended to cause the family or household member to be fearful</li>
		<li>
abuse of older Australians (also known as elder abuse) is a form of family and domestic violence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Family and domestic violence can include, but is not limited to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
physical violence</li>
		<li>
sexual assault and other sexually abusive behaviour</li>

<p></p>

<p>Consideration <strong>must</strong> be given when assessing a Power of Attorney, Guardianship, Administrative Order or Authorised Representative for Medicare where family and domestic violence (including abuse of older Australians) may be a concern. If family and domestic violence appears to be evident, a referral to the social worker must be made.

an original or a certified copy of the POA document</li>

a written letter of request which includes the attorney/donee's Medicare number and signature</li>

POA is not for a specific purpose, such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Health - this refers to medical treatment or a decision made in relation to medical treatment. This does not authorise a person to interact with the agency</li>
			<li>
Conveyancing - this refers to the sale, purchase or rental of a property. This does not authorise a person to interact with the agency</li>		</ul>
		<li>
POA is enduring (permanent), general, financial or limited - usually found on the front of the document</li>
			<ul>			<li>
A general POA may be for specific periods or events and usually has an end date. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> end dates are recorded by the agency</li>
			<li>
Financial POA allows interaction with the agency</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Attorney/donee&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Has expressly consented to act and accepts appointment as attorney/donee. This is found in a signed statement, usually at the back of the POA</li>
			<li>
Signature is witnessed by a third party. In some cases, two independent witnesses (cannot be witnessed by the donor)</li>
			<li>
Cannot witness the donor's signature</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Donor's signature requires two independent witnesses. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if there is only one witness and the form allows for one witness, this is acceptable by the agency</li>
		</ul>
<p>When processing a new POA, relevant details of the POA must be included in the CDMS. In particular&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
General POA - do not record an end date unless it is recorded in the document</li>
		<li>
Enduring POA, Guardianship and Administration Orders - do not record an end date</li>
		<li>
Limited POA - record an end date</li>
		</ul>
<p>POA documents do not need to be sighted annually once they are recorded in the CDMS. The <strong>Sight POA due date</strong> field is now obsolete and is <strong>not</strong> to be completed.</p>

<p>There is a risk to the agency of the POA being revoked without its knowledge, but this is considered a low.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the power has been given jointly to more than one attorney/donee, photo identity for all attorneys/donees must be provided and details of each attorney/donee must be recorded in the <strong>POA</strong> field in <strong>CDMS</strong>. A POA is <strong>not valid</strong> when the donor is deceased.</p>

<p>Where a POA indicates it only becomes valid when the donor becomes incapacitated, a letter from a medical practitioner which states this information <strong>must</strong> be sighted. If a letter is not provided, the POA details will not be included on the donor's record in CDMS. See <a href="../your-health/011-44015000-03.html">Escalation process for Medicare Eligibility</a>.</p>

<p>If a POA is presented at a Service centre, Service Officers scan all documentation, together with a certified copy of the POA into PaNDA, by selecting the <strong>Medicare Eligibility Enrolment</strong> work type.</p>

<p>A second letter is sent to the legal entity to advise of their client's Medicare number and expiration date once the POA has been recorded. See <a href="../your-health/011-40030000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Letters">Registration of Public Trustee</a> letter.</p>

<p>The guardian/trustee's address is recorded at group (card) level and the personal (consumer) mailing address is recorded as the person’s mailing address. This allows for the customer to change their address at the personal level. This will not cause the group address to change and will not affect the guardian/trustee receiving correspondence.</p>

<p>Customer who are under a Financial Management or other guardianship orders cannot change their bank account details without first consulting with the relevant legal entity. Service officers should seek advice before updating or storing bank account details. Request to store banking details permanently from a trustee can be recorded in CDMS. See <a href="../your-health/011-43120020-01.html">Store, confirm and end date bank account details for Medicare EFT payments</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-40030000-03.html">Process</a> page contains details on how to record this information.</p>

<p>A person (aged 14 years and over) who is unable to manage their own affairs, make sound decisions or give reasonable instructions, may be able to have an Authorised Representative to act on their behalf for Medicare purposes. Evidence must be shown that the customer is unable to manage their own affairs due to their intellectual or physical disability.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a person already has a Power of Attorney, Guardianship Order or Administration Order, they have the legal authority to act on behalf of the customer. The Power of Attorney, Guardianship Order or Administration Order should be registered (if not already) with the agency. A person cannot apply (nor is there any reason to apply) to be an authorised representative if a legal authority is already in place.</p>

<p>Authorised Representative arrangements allow an Authorised Representative to interact with the agency on behalf of a customer as if they were the customer themselves.</p>

			<li>
not acting in the customer's best interest (for example, allegations of misuse have been made or the authorised representative arrangement is inappropriate)</li>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Evidence of similar arrangement</strong></p>

<p>This can include one of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

		<li>
evidence of Centrelink nominee arrangement</li>
		<li>
evidence of similar arrangements with another organisation or government agency, for example, bank or financial institution, or</li>

<p>Service Officers must be aware that if a customer has a POA recorded in CDMS, this doesn't apply to their Medicare online account. This only gives them the legal right to act on behalf of the customer with Medicare.</p>

<p>There is no Nominated Representative process for Medicare online accounts. If a person is provided access through POA, there is no way of knowing who is using the online account.</p>

<p>It's a major privacy and security breach if a third party is given access to a customer's Medicare online account.</p>
