<p>If <strong>contract</strong> income is received by employees periodically, as a wage or retainer, or as lump sum for a period of 52 weeks or less, treat the commission income as employment income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the income on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen using the Employment Type code 'Earnings from Employment’ (<strong>EAR)</strong></li>
		<li>
Use the frequency ‘Income for one period’ (<strong>IOP</strong>) or ‘Long Period’ (<strong>LOP</strong>) to record the income using the date paid as the event date</li>
		<li>
The income is assessed from the <strong>EPSD</strong> of the period in which the payment was paid, for a number of days equal to the period that the payment represents or for the length of the entitlement period (whichever is longer). This is the known as the assessment period</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for assistance with coding the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>If <strong>contract</strong> income is received by employees as a lump sum for a period greater than 52 weeks&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the remunerative lump sum on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen under a separate employer entry. For the new employer entry&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Use the Employment Type code 'Earnings from Employment’ (<strong>EAR)</strong></li>
			<li>
Enter the employer’s name and add ‘lump sum’ at the end, for example ‘Services Australia lump sum’. If repeating for multiple lump sums, add each lump sum using a new employer entry and add the date the lump sum was received to create a unique employer name</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Use the frequency code ‘Daily’ (<strong>DAY</strong>) to record the income using the Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) of the period in which the payment was paid as the event date</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Use a combination of the Payment Calendar and the customer’s Payment Delivery (<strong>RAD</strong>) and Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>) screens to determine the EPSD of the period if required</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The income is assessed from the <strong>EPSD</strong> of the period in which the payment was paid, for a number of days equal to the period that the payment represents. This is the known as the assessment period</li>
		<li>
Divide the amount received by the number of days in the period that the payment represents. Record this figure in the <strong>Amount</strong> field</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For example, a lump sum of $5,000 for a period of 1,000 days is a daily amount of $5</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The income must be ceased from the assessment period end date plus 1 day. Use the <a href="../debts/107-03040000-01.html">Perpetual Centrelink Calendar</a> if required to determine the end date of the assessment</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If this date has not yet passed, record a manual review in Customer First/Customer Record including details of the income received, the assessment period and the date from which the assessment is to be ceased. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-06090030-01.html">How to code and action a manual review</a>. Use review reason ‘Earnings Review’ (INC) and add the keyword <strong>OVER52WK</strong></li>
			<li>
If this date has passed at the time the income is being recorded, record and cease the income in the same activity, no review is required</li>		</ul>
		<li>
To cease the income, record an amount of zero using the assessment period end date plus 1 day as the event date. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-03.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for assistance with coding the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>The table on the <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03050030-05.html">Resources</a> page explains how to assess commission income for employees after 7 December 2020.</p>

<p>No deductions can be made for expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an employee, such as a taxi driver, has takings including Goods and Services Tax (GST), the amount of GST is not considered income if the amount is remitted to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This is similar to the treatment of business income where GST is forwarded to the ATO.</p>
