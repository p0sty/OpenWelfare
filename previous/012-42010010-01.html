<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Definition_of_a">Definition of a provider number</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A provider number is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Allocated by Services Australia (the agency) to a registered medical practitioner or non-medical health professional (dentist, optometrist, nurse practitioner or midwife). It identifies the person and their health profession at the practice location/s where the person practises their profession</li>
		<li>
Sometimes referred to as a provider/registration number for allied health professionals</li>
		<li>
Generated by the PDS on processing of an application for a provider number and is allocated from a provider number stack held in the database tables</li>
		<li>
<strong>not</strong> automatically granted with access to Medicare benefits. The issuing of a provider number does not mean the following are eligible to attract Medicare benefits for their professional services&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
medical practitioner</li>
			<li>
non-medical health professional, or </li>
			<li>
allied health professional</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>'Provider number' refers to the number issued by the agency to identify health professionals in the Medicare PDS system.</p>

<p>A provider number may allow the health professional to either, or all of the below&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
refer their patient to another health professional (usually a specialist or consultant physician), or </li>
		<li>
request diagnostic imaging or pathology services where their patient can claim Medicare benefits at the referred rate, or</li>
		<li>
attract Medicare benefits for their services at particular practice locations or at all practice locations Medicare benefit eligibility is determined by the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) and supporting Regulations and Determinations. The <a href="../health-professionals/012-42010010-04.html">References</a> page contains a link to this Act.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Refer all enquiries about a health professional's eligibility to access Medicare benefits for their services to Provider Registration staff. Only give advice about a health professional's eligibility after a security check is completed, to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the health professional, or</li>
		<li>
a third party</li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Structure_of_a_">Structure of a provider number</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A provider number consists of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
6 numerals referred to as the <strong>provider stem</strong>, for example 123456</li>
		<li>
an alpha or numeric character that identifies the practice location, for example 1234561</li>
		<li>
an alpha check digit, for example 1234561A</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>the 8 character provider number is calculated using an algorithm. All 8 characters must be included in written correspondence to the provider, including any leading zeros.</p>

<p>A provider number can be allocated where the health professional&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
can access Medicare benefit rebates for their services (subject to any legislative restrictions or requirements)</li>
		<li>
can refer or request services for which their patient can claim a Medicare rebate</li>
		<li>
has relevant qualifications or eligibility as set out in the Act and supporting regulations or related program guidelines</li>
		</ul>
<p>Eligible health professionals are issued a provider number for providing services included under the Medicare program.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Provider_number">Provider number for each location</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A health professional should have a provider number for every practice location where they provide services. This policy is supported by the Health Insurance Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to this rule, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Locum Tenens provisions, see the <a href="../health-professionals/012-42010010-05.html#bp05_L2LL_MBS_Online">Resources</a> page for MBS Online</li>
		<li>
Mobile services</li>
		<li>
Home visits and telehealth</li>
		</ul>
<p>These exceptions <strong>do not</strong> apply when the health professional is subject to any restrictions on accessing Medicare benefits or are participants in an Other Medical Practitioners Program (OMPS).</p>

<p>Health professionals can request an additional provider number, even if they have an existing provider number at the same location, for the purpose of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Medicare Urgent Care Clinics (UCC), or</li>
		<li>
a General Practitioner Respiratory Clinics (GPRC)</li>

<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Provider_locati"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Provider_locati">Provider location address</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A practice address is recorded in PDS and is known as the provider number or provider location address. The address in PDS is available to authorised recipients, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
private health funds</li>
		<li>
Department of Health and Aged Care (DHAC)</li>
		<li>
Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Recording the correct practice address in PDS allows payment of Medicare incentive items. The incentive payment is linked to the Rural, Remote, and Metropolitan Area (RRMA) and the Modified Monash Model (MMM) 2019 geographical classification system for the location where the service is performed.</p>

<p>For more details, see <a target="_blank" href="../health-professionals/012-42010020-01.html">Provider location details for health professionals in Medicare</a>.</p>

<p>Legislation requires a claim for a Medicare benefit must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the name of the health professional and the address of the place of practice, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
the provider number of the health professional for the practice location</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more details, see <a target="_blank" href="../your-health/011-43010030-01.html">Account and receipt documents for Medicare claims processing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Use of a home address as the provider number location address</strong></p>

<p>The agency is unable to suppress a provider number address. Therefore, health professionals should carefully consider using a home address for a provider number, as the provider number location address may be publicly available. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
viewable on pay doctor via claimant (PDVC) cheques. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>health professionals can request a pay group link to direct payment of Medicare benefit cheques to a PO Box address. See <a href="../health-professionals/012-40010000-01.html">Payment pay group link for Medicare benefit cheques</a> for more details and the form required</li>
		<li>
requests for pathology services</li>
		<li>
available to private health funds for the purposes of their business</li>
		</ul>
<p>Information for health professionals about using a home address as a practice location with the address being publicly available is included in the Application for a Medicare provider number (HW019 and HW093).</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> provider addresses are <strong>no longer</strong> visible in a patient's myGov or My Health Record claims history, effective February 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Requests from health professionals to use an alternative provider location addresses (such as a PO Box)</strong></p>

<p>Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), an increasing number of health professionals are providing COVID-19 specific telehealth services (currently included in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) until 30 June 2022 from their home address.</p>

<p>The agency is aware some health professionals have expressed safety concerns following their move to home-based consultations.</p>

<p>Under the COVID-19 arrangements, health professionals can continue to use their <strong>current</strong> practice location number and address while delivering telehealth services from home. They do not need to apply for a new provider number.</p>

<p>The agency may consider recording an alternative address (such as PO Box), for a health professional where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the home is the <strong>only</strong> practice location, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the health professional is only providing telehealth services or mobile consultations</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the agency does <strong>not</strong> accept parcel lockers as an alternative address. The PO Box must be registered to the health professional.</p>

<p>All health professionals requesting an alternative address <strong>must</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
submit a signed request, and</li>
		<li>
include the below details&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
current practice location arrangements. For example, the physical practice is closed due to COVID-19 and only providing telehealth services from the home location</li>
			<li>
reason for using an alternate address. For example, safety concerns</li>
			<li>
proposed alternative address. For example, a PO Box (this cannot be a parcel locker)</li>
			<li>
physical practice (home address). This is recorded in the Notes section of PDS</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the process for requesting a provider number for a new location, including home addresses, remains the same.</p>

<p><strong>Medical or non-medical practitioner requests to use alternative provider location address</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
All requests from medical practitioners and non-medical health professionals are escalated to the Services Australia corporate office</li>
			<ul>			<li>
See <a href="../health-professionals/012-42010070-01.html">Provider number registrations in PDS for health professionals in Medicare</a> for details on provider registration enquiry escalations</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis to make sure legislative requirements are met</li>
		<li>
The use of an alternative location address may affect eligibility with other programs. For example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)</li>
			<li>
Prescription Shopping Programme (PSP)</li>
			<li>
Practice Incentives Program (PIP)</li>
			<li>
Workforce Incentive Program (WIP)</li>
			<li>
Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)</li>
			<li>
Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Allied health professional requests to use alternative location address</strong></p>

<p>Service Delivery assess requests from allied health professionals. For details on eligibility criteria and process, see <a href="../health-professionals/012-19052715-01.html">Allied health and non-medical professionals provider number applications and requests</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Provider_Servic">Provider Service Rules (PSR)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A Provider Service Rule (PSR) is a code applied to a health professional’s record in PDS. These are created by the Provider Eligibility team in Services Australia corporate office. These are applied at the time of processing a provider number application or by Services Australia corporate office when required.</p>

<p>A PSR can be used for the following reasons&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a health professional is restricted from accessing Medicare benefits for certain services following a determination by Professional Services Review</li>
		<li>
to prevent access to Medicare benefits&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
where the health professional is not eligible to provide Medicare for services in that location, but may require a provider number for other reasons. For example, to write referrals for diagnostic imaging or pathology tests, or refer a patient on to another health professional</li>
			<li>
for medical practitioners who are not eligible to provide Medicare services for a period of time at a particular location. For example, there is a gap period between the cessation and commencement dates of a 19AB exemption</li>
			<li>
where business structure requirements have not been met</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p></p>

<p>PSRs are applied, where applicable, to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
restrict Medicare claiming by a single item or by a range of items</li>
		<li>
individual or all practice locations (location specific)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Multiple PSRs can be used at the same time.</p>

<p>PSRs hinder electronic claiming and should not be used unless there is a genuine need.</p>

<p>Only PSR 618 can be removed over the phone. This applies where the 618 service rule was placed on the location when initially created as the business structure and banking details were not supplied for allied health, non-medical and standard medical providers only.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>service rule is not to be removed from nurse practitioners, midwives, medical practitioners subject to section 19AB or General Practitioner Respiratory Clinics (GPRC) locations.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Important changes resulting from the Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Act 2018 (the Act) took effect 1 July 2018. The Act amends the Health Insurance Act 1973.</p>

<p><strong>Shared Debt Recovery Scheme</strong></p>

<p>The Act also introduced the Shared Debt Recovery Scheme (SDRS) on 1 July 2019. The Scheme allows the Commonwealth to hold both a practitioner (primary debtor) and another party (secondary debtor) responsible for repayment of compliance debts, arising as a result of incorrectly claiming Medicare benefits, through the making of a shared debt determination. The Scheme was introduced because Medicare billing is often delegated to non-health professionals, administered through centralised billing areas and can be influenced by organisational processes and policies. In some instances, this has led to incorrect billing practices.</p>

<p>The agency assesses Provider Registration applications in the date order received unless exceptional circumstances apply. For these, the agency can prioritise the application for quicker processing. This is done to support customers in getting continued access to medical and psychological services or if a practice/community is affected by a disaster.</p>

<p>An exceptional circumstance applies if one or more of the following affects an applicant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the only health professional in a community or rural/remote practice leaves, and an urgent replacement in one of the following professions is required&#58;</li>

Nurse Practitioner</li>

a disaster has occurred, and&#58;</li>

the community needs urgent health care near the disaster</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the practice is a Commonwealth-approved respiratory clinic</li>
		<li>
the medical practitioner has reached their scaling end date but is unable to create locations via HPOS due to a future moratorium end date</li>

have had current registration, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
relevant access to Medicare benefits at the time of the requested location start date</li>
		<li>
the application is for a provider number for a General Practitioner Respiratory Clinic (GPRC) requesting an earlier start date. Do not back date to before 30 June 2023</li>

<p>A request to backdate may be where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a provider number application is received, requesting a <strong>new</strong> provider number location start date before the date of lodgement, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
a written request is received, requesting an <strong>existing</strong> provider number location start date be amended before existing start date</li>
		</ul>
<p>A written request can be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an email, providing the email is received from the email address recorded on the stem in PDS</li>
		<li>
a letter signed by the health professional</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the health professional <strong>meets </strong>these requirements, the Service Officer can start/backdate the location as per the application or written request. Services Australia corporate office approval is <strong>not </strong>required. There is no restriction on how far a provider number can be backdated if the health professional meets these requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>requests to backdate can be processed via the phone, under the following conditions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A full security check has been performed successfully, by either the provider or a third party</li>
		<li>
A provider is eligible and is unrestricted from the requested start date (add note to stem)</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>If the health professional <strong>does not </strong>meet the above requirements, the start date of the location should be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date the health professional held current registration, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
the date when the relevant access is required</li>
		</ul>
<p>The above process <strong>does not apply</strong> for locations with <strong>3GA placements</strong> or for medical practitioners subject to <strong>section 19AB of the Act</strong>. Follow current processing requirements for these health professionals.</p>
