<p><strong>Update employment status online service</strong></p>

<p>Carers who use the Update employment status online service to notify that work commenced or carer activities changed, more than 14 days ago will be asked to contact Services Australia.

		</ul>
<p><strong>Paid employment</strong></p>

<p>When assisting a customer to report, make a genuine attempt to transition them to reporting via self service options, unless an exception applies.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-21050030-01.html">Earnings and reporting tool</a> to code employment income if the carer is not relinquishing CP.</p>

<p>See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> and <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010040-01.html">Determining the Date of Event (DOV) for employment income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notification reporters</strong></p>

<p>Except where the carer is eligible for recording employment income as MTE or is paid in Environment I, place carer notification reporters onto 2 weekly reporting if they advise they or their partner have commenced or changed their paid employment. This includes when employment income will be paid at a regular amount. </p>

<p>Use the Earnings and reporting tool to record activity hours since commencement and any employment income amounts already paid prior to their first reporting date. Record employment income as <strong>IOP</strong> or <strong>LOP</strong> as applicable.</p>

<p>Assist carers with self-service options and advise their next reporting date.</p>

<p>Carer notification reporters who exceed 25 hours per week will be unable to complete their report online using Update Employment income. A work item/activity will be created for staff to complete when the customer contacts.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Earnings and Reporting workflow</strong></p>

<p>If the carer has started paid work but has not yet been paid, select <strong>Carer Activity</strong> (<strong>CPAD</strong>) <strong>Only</strong> as the <strong>Type of Employment Details Update</strong>.</p>

<p>If <strong>IOP</strong> or <strong>LOP</strong> are keyed as the <strong>Type of Employment Details Update</strong>, select <strong>Save Response</strong> and select <strong>Carer Activity (CPAD) Only</strong> to record hours. See <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-21050030-01.html">Carer Payment (CP) processing in the Earnings and reporting tool</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other actions</strong></p>

<p>If coding manually, correct/update/code&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
employment income via the Employment Income Paid Summary (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen, and</li>
		<li>
weekly hours worked and travel time on the Carer Payment Activity Details (<strong>CPAD</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the carer and/or their partner receive Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Subsidy (CCS), check if they need to <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05030020-01.html">update their income estimate</a>. Explain to the carer the choices available to help reduce the chance of an overpayment.</p>

<p>The decision to cancel CP is because the carer no longer provides constant care and attention.
