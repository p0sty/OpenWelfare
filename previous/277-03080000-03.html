<p>Before a child turns 18 years of age, an automatic letter is sent to customers (both private collect and child support collect). The letter advises customers of their options in relation to their 18 year old child. The letter also advises customers that their Family Tax Benefit (FTB) payments may be affected and that more information is available on the Services Australia website.</p>

<p>Where the letter is issued online, customers will receive a myGov message (below) encouraging them to take action. The message will differ slightly where the child is a child of the assessment or a relevant dependent child. The message contains a link to view the relevant letter, and links to the application form and information on how to apply on the servicesaustralia.gov.au website.</p>

<p><strong>Message in relation to child of assessment&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Hello (customer name)<br>We know that you have a child/ren turning 18 years of age soon.<br>Child support ends when a child turns 18. However, if the child continues in full-time secondary education after they turn 18, you can apply to extend child support to the end of the school year. You must do this before they turn 18.<br>What you can do<br>Read the letter below and apply before <strong>your child turns 18</strong>. To apply, click on the link below ‘Apply to extend child support past a child’s 18th birthday’<br>Regards<br>Child Support</p>

<p>If a customer is on tracing, or no payments have been received in the last 12 months, an <strong>Over 18 advice Letters Pended</strong> intray item is generated and routed to the customer's owning case officer. These cases will need further investigation.</p>

<p>In some cases, this letter is not automatically generated, or is sent incorrectly, offering an ineligible parent the option of extending the child support assessment for the child turning 18 years of age.</p>

<p>In the event a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
customer makes contact about an incorrectly issued letter, apologise for any confusion that may have been caused and advise them of their options</li>
		<li>
over 18 advice letter does not generate, consideration should be given to accepting a late application in accordance with the <strong>exceptional circumstances</strong> provisions. Contact a Service Support Officer (SSO) to discuss any cases that arise</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Lodging an application to extend child support/relevant dependent</strong></p>

<p>An application to extend an assessment beyond a child's eighteenth birthday should be made by the carer entitled to child support for that child before the child turns 18 years of age.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a parent may be a carer entitled to child support for a child, but be assessed as the overall payer because of other children in the other parent’s care. The payer is able to lodge an application for the child in their care.</p>

<p>Where both parents are eligible carers, neither parent may have a liability to pay child support if the annual rate for both parents is $0. In such cases, either eligible carer can apply to extend the assessment for the child. An application to have a relevant dependent child recognised in the child support assessment beyond the child’s eighteenth birthday should be made by the child’s parent before the child turns 18 years of age.</p>

<p><strong>Care suspensions</strong></p>

<p>A customer may lodge an application to extend the assessment beyond the child’s eighteenth birthday when they are not a carer entitled to child support due to a pending care determination. For more information on taking an application see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Record_and_revi_Step05">Step 5 in Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>‘Claimed for’ children</strong></p>

<p>If a customer applies on a day on which the assessment is later suspended due to a change in care advised outside of 28 days, the application cannot be accepted. The system will automatically set the application to invalid via an overnight batch run and issue letters to the customers.</p>

<p>If the automatic process cannot be run due to case circumstances, intrays will generate to prompt eligibility to be manually run or letters to be manually issued.<br><strong>Do not manually set the application to invalid</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant dependent children</strong></p>

<p>If a customer applies for a relevant dependent child to be included in a child support assessment beyond their eighteenth birthday and the customer’s care of the child drops below 35% due to a change in care advised outside of 28 days, <strong>do not</strong> accept the application. Manually reject the application and document the application is invalid. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010110-01.html">Child over eighteen Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lodgement after a child turns 18 years of age</strong></p>

<p>Although an application can be made after the child turns 18 years of age, the assessment/relevant dependent allowance can only be extended if there were <strong>exceptional circumstances</strong> which prevented the making of the application before the child’s eighteenth birthday. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-04.html#bp04_L2LL_Policy">References</a> &gt; Policy.</p>

<p>Immediately consider whether exceptional circumstances exist and document that decision in Cuba. If a decision is made that exceptional circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>do exist</strong> (or may exist, but evidence is required), follow the usual process steps ensuring the correct application status is keyed as outlined in the <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010110-01.html">Child over eighteen Cuba Process Help</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>do not exist</strong>, immediately refuse the application, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_a_decision_Step02">Step 2 in Table 3</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>A late application <strong>must always</strong> be recorded, regardless of whether the application may be accepted or refused.</p>

<p>Offer customers the option to apply for a late application when they enquire. Explain when and how a late application is accepted. The delegation to accept or refuse to accept a late application for assessment or agreement to continue beyond the child's 18th birthday is APS4 and above. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Record_and_revi_Step05">Table 2 Step 5</a>.</p>

<p>Where an application is made via Child Support online account, the details will automatically load to the Customer Application List window in Cuba, with a <strong>Pending</strong> status. A letter will automatically be sent to the other party. The letter will advise they have 14 days to contact Child Support if they disagree.</p>

<p>If the application is not disputed within 21 days, most applications will automatically be accepted and applied. Service Officers will not receive notification and generally, no manual actions will be required. If contact with both parents is made prior to the 21 days, and the application is not disputed, advise the customers the application will be accepted automatically in 21 days from lodgement and they will receive letters to confirm. No further action is required.</p>

<p>There are known issues where this outcome is not automatically applied by Cuba, and manual intervention is required. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_a_decision_Step05">Step 5 in Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer applies on a day on which the assessment is later suspended, due to a change in care advised outside of 28 days, the application cannot be accepted. The system will automatically set the application to invalid via an overnight batch run. Where the automatic process cannot be run due to case circumstances, intrays will generate to prompt eligibility to be manually run, or letters to be manually issued.</p>

<p>If customers apply to extend an initiating agreement, it must be in writing or on the form. There are different application rules depending on the type and terms of the agreement.</p>

<p>The <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link to the form.</p>

<p>Extending an assessment where an agreement is in place is not available when applying via Child Support online account.</p>

<p><strong>Initiating Binding Agreement - with no end date</strong></p>

<p>If the agreement has initiated the child support assessment and the agreement does not specify an end date or specifies an end date <strong>after</strong> the child’s eighteenth birthday, both customers must apply in writing to extend their agreement past the child’s eighteenth birthday. The agreement will continue until the end of the school year in which the child turns 18 years of age. Unless a joint application is made, a terminating event occurs when the child turns 18.</p>

<p><strong>Initiating Binding Agreement - with end date</strong></p>

<p>If the agreement has initiated the child support assessment and it specifies that the agreement is to end when the child turns 18 years of age or some other specified date prior to the child’s eighteenth birthday, the agreement cannot be extended, even if both customers apply. If the child is not yet 18 years of age, the customers may make a new agreement to end the agreement and then either enter into a new agreement or make an application for an administrative assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the agreement has initiated the child support assessment and the agreement ends, the assessment will end when the agreement ends. Check if an assessment registration has been recorded and is active. If so, update the end date of the assessment registration so that it ends on the same date as the initiating agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Non - initiating agreement (Binding Agreement or Limited Agreement) - no end date</strong></p>

<p>If the agreement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
was accepted when there was an administrative assessment on the case, and</li>
		<li>
does not specify that the agreement ends when the child turns 18 years of age</li>
		</ul>
<p>The carer entitled to child support can apply to extend the assessment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
as modified by the agreement</li>
		<li>
to the end of the school year in which the child turns 18 years of age</li>

<p>If the agreement was accepted when there was an administrative assessment on the case and the agreement specifies that the agreement ends when the child turns 18 years of age, the carer entitled to child support can apply to extend the underlying <strong>formula assessment</strong> to the end of the school year in which the child turns 18 years of age.</p>

<p>For departure orders, the order to change the assessment will end under section 142 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 when a terminating event occurs. The effect of an application to extend child support is to delay that terminating event, so the Court Varied Assessment lasts for as long as the assessment does.</p>

<p><strong>Repeating a school year</strong></p>

<p>If a child repeats a year of secondary education, the Registrar can continue a child support assessment for the child, up to the last day of the repeated secondary school year where the child's 18th birthday will occur in that repeated school year.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Example 1</p>

<p>James completes Year 12 on 30 November 2023. James turns 18 on 2 January 2024. James repeats Year 12 in 2024 and that school year ends 15 December 2024. The assessment can be extended to 15 December 2024.</p>

<p>Example 2</p>

<p>Oliver completes Year 12 on 30 November 2023. Oliver turns 18 on 15 November 2023. Oliver repeats Year 12 the following year and that school year ends 10 December 2024. The assessment can be extended to 30 November 2023. Even though Oliver will enrol in a full-time secondary education the next year, he turns 18 2023 calendar year and the assessment can only be extended to the last day of the 2023 school year. </p>

<p><strong>Child turns 18 during end of year holiday period</strong></p>

<p>Example 3</p>

<p>Uma completes Year 11 on 15 December 2023. Uma will commence Year 12 on 1 February 2024 and finishes Year 12 on 30 November 2024. Uma turns 18 on 31 January 2024. The assessment can be extended to 30 November 2024as Uma turned 18 in the 2024 calendar year.</p>

<p>Example 4</p>

<p>James completes Year 11 on 15 December 2023. James will commence Year 12 on 1 February 2024. James turns 18 on 20 December 2023. The assessment cannot be extended as James turns 18 in the 2023 calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>School year or year level spanning 2 calendar years - including examples</strong></p>

<p>For most students the school year falls within a calendar year. Some secondary schools have a school year that spans 2 calendar years. This may include a school that elects to commence year 12 in the final term of the preceding year or a school in the northern hemisphere. The Registrar can continue a child support assessment for a child attending these schools up to the last day of school in the calendar year in which the child turns 18.</p>

<p>Commencement of a school year is determined by the secondary school at which a child is enrolled.</p>

<p>Example 5</p>

<p>At Charlie’s school, year 12 commences in Term 4 (October 2023) and the last day of classes for the year is 30 November 2023. Charlie turns 18 on 5 November 2023. Charlie continues year 12 studies in 2024 and the last day of classes for year 12 is August 2024. The assessment can be extended until 30 November 2023 as this is the last day of classes in the calendar year in which Charlie turns 18.</p>

<p>Example 6</p>

<p>At Jo’s school, year 12 commences in Term 4 (6 October 2023). Jo turns 18 on 15 February 2024. Jo continues year 12 studies in 2024 and the last day of classes for year 12 is September 2024. Jo is required to sit year 12 examinations in October 2024. The school has advised the last day of exams is 31 October 2024. The assessment can be extended until the end of October 2024 as this is the last day of exams and this date falls within the calendar year in which Jo turns 18. </p>

<p>Example 7</p>

<p>At Jesse’s school, year 12 commences in Term 4. Term 3 finishes on 1 October 2023 and Jesse commences Year 12 in Term 4 on 18 October 2023. Jesse turns 18 on 12 October 2023 during the school holidays. The assessment can be extended to the last day of classes in the 2023 calendar year.</p>

<p>Example 8</p>

<p>Astrid lives in the UK where the school year starts in July and ends in June the next year. Astrid turns 18 in November 2023. The assessment can be extended to the last day of classes in 2023 as the calendar year in which Astrid turns 18.</p>

<p><strong>Exact date not provided</strong></p>

<p>If the exact date of the commencement or last day of the secondary school year has not been provided, contact the customer to request this information. As the customer may need to contact the school or relevant educational authorities to determine the date, ask the customer to provide a date within 7 days (or 14 days if the customer cannot be contacted by phone, and a please contact letter is sent).</p>

<p>If the customer cannot provide the exact date for the last day of the secondary school year, they should provide a date as close as possible to the actual last day. Explain to the customer, it is their responsibility to advise Child Support, if they later find the date will be different. If they <strong>do not advise</strong> of the change, there could be adverse effects such as arrears or overpayments, (depending on whether the correct date is earlier or later than the date originally provided).</p>

<p>Advise the customer if an exact date, or a reasonable approximate date, is not provided within the specified timeframe, a decision will be made to refuse the application. Document this advice.</p>

<p><strong>Revised date provided after application accepted</strong></p>

<p>If Child Support is later notified of a revised last day of the secondary school year (and that date is accepted to be more accurate), the Service Officer must take action to change the date via the <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a> process. This is not the same as a child withdrawing from full-time secondary school prior to the last day of the school year. If that occurs, it is a terminating event.

<p>The other party may not be able to obtain independent evidence about the child/ren in the applicant's care. In these cases, the primary source of independent evidence could be the secondary school the child is attending.</p>

<p>Third parties, such as schools, can be contacted to request information such as the commencement date or last day of that school’s year. The Department of Education of the relevant state/territory can be contacted to determine the last day of the exam period for the child’s year level. If necessary, request the information using a notice issued under section 161 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989.</p>

<p>In this context, the term independent evidence can include evidence obtained from independent third parties by the parent. For example, the parent may have documents from the school with details of their child’s studies.</p>

<p>If there is a dispute about an easily proven fact, such as the name of a course, it may be appropriate to put the onus on the parent to substantiate their claims before accepting the application.</p>

<p>Some education institutions conduct both secondary and tertiary courses. Contact the institution and ask if the child's course is classified as secondary education. A school year may extend beyond a calendar year but the assessment can only be extended to the last day of classes or exams in the calendar year in which the child turns 18 If required, contact the institution and confirm the commencement date of the school year.</p>

<p>When reviewing or actioning an application at any stage, there are several potential issues to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Case is about to end</strong></p>

<p>When manually recording an application, check the date the case ends. If the application is pended within 21 days of the child turning 18 years of age and the case is due to end before the application can be automatically accepted by Cuba, manual intervention is required. A <strong>Liability Calculation Required</strong> intray sometimes generates as a prompt, but this does not always occur.</p>

<p>If it is identified that the case will end prior to the application being finalised, create a General Follow Up intray (including notes about the application, case end date and the potential need to give effect to the decision manually). At the end of the 21 day period check the assessment and, if required, save eligibility manually to give effect to the decision. If required seek <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">SSO support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic acceptance does not occur</strong></p>

<p>A known Cuba issue exists where some applications are not automatically accepted 21 days after the application is first pended. This issue can occur at all times (that is, regardless of whether it is a formula or departure assessment, or the application is pended manually or via Child Support online account, or the pending occurs more or less than 21 days prior to the case ending). When this issue occurs, one of the following 2 intrays will generate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Liability Calculation Required</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Manual Decision Required</strong> with the following intray notes&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Cuba cannot automatically finalise a pended application. Check the application details and the eligibility pre-confirmation results. If a departure is in place, seek support from your SSO to ensure the extension is applied correctly. Eligibility must be saved manually to give effect to the outcome</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Both of these intrays should be actioned the same way because they are a prompt about&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
checking the application details and outcome displayed in the eligibility pre-confirmation window in Cuba, and</li>
		<li>
applying the decision by manually saving eligibility</li>
		</ul>
<p>If required seek <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">SSO support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Letters did not generate in the automatic process</strong></p>

<p>In some situations when the application is made invalid, the automated process will not generate letters. Where this happens the following intray generates&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>CLKCARE&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
There will be a notepad in the intray confirming that invalid letters need to be generated manually</li>
			<li>
See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Make_a_decision_Step08">Step 8 in Table 3</a></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Agreement, court order or COA extension</strong></p>

<p>If an application is made to extend an agreement, court order or change of assessment, <strong>manual intervention</strong> may be required to key the application and make the final decision, including the extension of any modifications to the formula. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010110-01.html">Child over eighteen Cuba Process Help</a> for further information and seek <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">SSO support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Late applications made after the child turns 18 years of age</strong></p>

<p>The delegation to accept or refuse a late application, after a child's 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, for assessment/agreement to continue in exceptional circumstances is APS4 and above.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> late applications <strong>must</strong> be recorded, regardless of whether the application may be accepted or refused.</p>

<p>If exceptional circumstances exist which prevented the making of the application before the child turned 18 years of age, <strong>manual intervention</strong> may be required to key the application and make the final decision. <a href="../separated-parents/277-03080000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Record_and_revi_Step01">Go to Step 1</a> or see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010110-03.html">Child over eighteen Cuba Process Help</a> and seek <a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">SSO support</a>.</p>

<p>If a decision is made that no exceptional circumstances exist and the application is refused, document the decision on the system immediately after the application is refused.</p>

<p>For all Child Support online account and phone applications (that are not disputed), Cuba will automatically update the status from 'Pending' to 'Accepted' and run eligibility after 21 days. This automated process means the extension of the assessment as well as the generation of the decision letters and assessment notices to both parties will generally occur without Service Officer intervention. A notepad will not generate for this type of automatic transaction.</p>

<p>If a customer applies on a day on which the assessment is later suspended due to a change in care advised outside of 28 days, the application cannot be accepted.</p>
