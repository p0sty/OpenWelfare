<p>A closely held employee is an individual directly related to the entity from which they receive income. For example&#58;</p>

Family members of a family business </li>
		<li>
Directors or shareholders of a company </li>
		<li>
Beneficiaries of a trust</li>
		</ul>
<p>Director's fees are assessed as employment income as they are received for remunerative work performed.</p>

<p><strong>If director's fees or other employment income is paid to a closely held employee&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
periodically, they are assessed as ordinary employment income and coded with frequency IOP or LOP from the date paid, for the period they represent. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a></li>
		<li>
as a lump sum, they are assessed from the entitlement period start date of the period in which they are paid for the period they represent, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-01.html">Treatment of lump sums</a> </li>
		</ul>
<p>These payments should only be recorded using continuous income frequencies if either the 1WE or 2WE exception or Pension Monthly Exception (MTE) Rule are met.</p>

<p>If recording a continuous income frequency for a lump sum paid prior to 7 December 2020, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-05.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> for instruction on how to convert this to variable income.</p>

<p><strong>When to refer to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) </strong></p>

<p>Employment income paid to a closely held employee is a deduction which may be claimed against business income for a private trust or private company. Changes to employment income paid may indicate a change of circumstances for the private trust or private company, which needs to be reviewed by a CAO. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a private trust or private company record is not linked to the customers record and the customer and/or their partner have received employment income paid to them as a closely held employee&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Code the employment income </li>
			<li>
Place the customer (and/or partner) onto statement reporting</li>
			<li>
Request customer (and partner, if applicable) tax returns, entity tax returns and financial statements along with a completed MOD PC or MOD PT form</li>
			<li>
See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05070010-03.html">Identifying and making suitable referrals to the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)</a> to create a referral to a CAO</li>
			<li>
Document the action taken on the customer's record</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the net income of the business will be different from the information being used in a current assessment due to changes in employment income paid&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Code the employment income </li>
			<li>
Place the customer (and/or partner) onto statement reporting</li>

<p>Employment income paid to a prisoner's dependants is regarded as employment income for assessment purposes. This may affect the rate of the partner's payment.</p>

<p>Work release from prison helps the prisoner contribute towards the cost of their upkeep and maintenance of their family. Prison authorities usually decide how much of the prisoner's employment income is given to the prisoner's family.</p>

<p>Although prisoners may go out to work each day, partnered people in this situation are still legally in prison. Their partners are still qualified for their payments, such as Parenting Payment Partnered, subject to all other eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>Long term prisoners granted approved study leave attend educational institutions for lectures, reading and research, and in some cases, live at work release hostels. During vacations, they are encouraged to seek part-time or casual work. Those who obtain work must contribute to their expenses and fees and may also contribute to the maintenance of their family.</p>

<p>In NSW, non-teaching support staff (teachers’ aides, library assistants or other non-teaching staff), are employees of the NSW Department of Education. As they are unable to work during term breaks, they receive a stand down payment, which is based on them meeting certain criteria.</p>

<p>Stand down payments are not, and have never been considered as leave payments for Social Security Purposes. Before 20 April 2010, stand down payments were assessed as a remunerative lump sum and held for a 52 week period from the date the customer received it. From the 20 April 2010, these payments are <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">assessed as ordinary employment income paid in the customer’s entitlement period</a>.</p>

<p>If a self-employed contractor or sub-contractor is without a contract and unemployed, Services Australia does not need to take into account business income, as the customer currently has no work and no employment income. When they do have work, generally the work can be classified in one of two ways&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>As an employee&#58;</strong> The customer gets casual employment where they are an employee. They work for an employer and are paid an hourly or daily rate. They do not need to provide materials or use their own equipment to do the work. In this case, the customer is treated as a casual employee. The customer declares their employment income on their Reporting Statement and the gross amount is assessed under section 1072 of the Social Security Act 1991, that is, with <strong>no allowable deductions</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>As a self-employed contractor or sub-contractor&#58;</strong> The customer is contracted to undertake a job for which they provide the material and equipment and are responsible for providing a service rather than just labour. In these cases, the agency must be rigorous in establishing the customer is still unemployed and this is not part of an ongoing pattern of contract/sub-contract employment; if the latter, the customer would stop to qualify for JobSeeker Payment for example</li>
		</ul>
<p>If satisfied this is just a one-off, short contract for a small job, there is some discretion to treat the customer as still unemployed. In these cases, the customer is operating as a contractor/sub-contractor, that is, self-employed rather than an employee. Therefore, income from the contract is treated as business income, and allowable deductions <strong>would</strong> apply as per section 1075 of the Social Security Act 1991.</p>

<p>The Support for Adult Australian Apprentices Payment is considered income. This payment has an effect on an apprentice's income according to the Income Test. The amount paid is $150 a week for the first year and $100 a week for the second year and is paid to their employer to subsidise wage costs or Australian Apprentices to boost their income. There is no multiple entitlement exclusion.</p>

<p>If the apprentice is 25 years and over and eligible for the Support for Adult Australian Apprentices (SAAA) payment, it must be coded on the Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) screen as '<strong>2WE</strong>' (regardless of how often they receive the payment) and a review coded for 1 July 2015 to end-date the income. If a customer advises SAAA will be paid directly by the employer as part of the customer's regular income, it must not be coded on <strong>OINS</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> SAAA payments will stop from 1 July 2015. Payments that fall due before this date will still be paid.</p>

<p>Sometimes customers may have employment agency fees deducted from their after tax income or they may have to pay an agency a percentage of their gross employment income. If so, agency fees must be treated like any other employment expense and be included in the customer's gross employment income used for social security purposes.</p>

<p>Sometimes employment agencies will have a contract with the employer and their fees are negotiated with the employer. The fees are deducted before payment of the customer's income and deduction of tax. These fees must not be included in the customer's gross income.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1&#58;</strong> A customer, who uses an agency to obtain casual employment placements as a nurse with a number of hospitals, may be charged a fee for every placement the agency provides. The fee is deducted from the after tax income of the customer and must be included in the customer's gross employment income.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2&#58;</strong> An employer negotiates a fee with a labour hire agency to provide five labourers for a local building site. The fee is paid per labourer. The customer receives an amount representing wages only and tax is deducted from this amount. The gross income of the customer is the amount paid before tax is deducted. The agency fee is not included in the customer's gross employment income.</p>

<p>An industry based lump sum payment may be conditional upon the customer discontinuing any involvement in that industry. Lump sum amounts may be paid to a customer because of their association with a particular industry. For example, payments under the Pork Producers Exit Payment.</p>

<p>Consideration will need to be given to whether the lump sum is remunerative or non-remunerative, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-03.html">Treatment of lump sums</a>. Generally, because receipt of the income is tied to a person’s (past) employment, amounts are considered remunerative. </p>

<p>If an amount is paid not in respect of a particular period, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exception</strong>&#58; Some industry based lump sum payments are <strong>not</strong> treated as income as they have a section 8(11) exemption, usually granted on the basis that a recipient needs to exit an entire industry. For example, a dairy farmer must exit farming, not just dairying.</p>
