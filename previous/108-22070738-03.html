<p>Before STP employment income can pre-fill for customers and staff, a successfully linked STP employer status is needed.</p>

<p>The standalone <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow can be used to <strong>confirm</strong> or <strong>reject</strong> a new STP employer, or update an existing STP employer’s record status. Service Officers can also make the same updates on the <strong>EMCF</strong> screen when using the Earnings and Reporting workflow.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Key <strong>START</strong> into the <strong>Super Key</strong></li>
		<li>
Select the <strong>STP Employer Update </strong>workflow from <strong>Task Selector</strong></li>
		<li>
 Select <strong>Start</strong></li>
		<li>
On the <strong>EMCF</strong> screen, select <strong>Edit</strong> to launch an <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> window. </li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Confirmed</strong> or <strong>Rejected</strong> from the <strong>Status</strong> drop down&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If confirming, the <strong>Employer</strong> drop down will list all current employers from <strong>EANS</strong>. </li>
			<li>
Select the existing employer name or New Employer, then <strong>Save</strong>. Selecting <strong>Cancel</strong> will go back to the original screen</li>
			<li>
If linking as a New Employer, it will pre-fill to <strong>EAPP</strong> with a pay event of <strong>0.00</strong> with <strong>DOV</strong> as the Entitlement period start date (EPSD) that the update is being made</li>		</ul>
		<li>
When selecting <strong>Save</strong>, a <strong>Receipt Date and Channel</strong> window shows. Complete the details and select <strong>Save</strong></li>
		<li>
The <strong>EMCF </strong>screen will show the provisional updates. Check the details are correct, then select <strong>Next</strong> to continue</li>
		<li>
The <strong>EANS</strong> screen will show the updated employer with <strong>Employer Verification</strong> field as <strong>STP</strong></li>
		<li>
Select <strong>Assess</strong> and <strong>Finalise</strong> the task</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the STP employer status is <strong>rejected</strong> and STP data is available when next reporting, the STP employer name and ABN/WPN will show again for the customer to review. If the customer rejects the employer a second time, an <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22111400-01.html">STP intervention</a> activity will be created for follow up by trained staff.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when an STP employer has been confirmed and linked to an existing employer from <strong>EANS</strong>, the pre-filled ABN will override the <strong>Employer ABN</strong> field of the linked employer. The ABN field of the STP verified employer will become greyed out and unable to be updated from <strong>EANS</strong>.</p>

<p>If an incorrect employer was linked, run the <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow to update the STP employer status to <strong>rejected</strong>. This will remove the overridden pre-filled ABN. When the activity is complete, the <strong>Employer ABN</strong> field of the incorrectly linked employer will revert to its previous status. The <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow may need to be run again to re-confirm the STP employer and link the correct employer from the existing employer list or select <strong>New Employer</strong>.</p>

<p>An update to an existing STP employer may be required when&#58;</p>

a customer contacts to correct their previous rejection of an STP employer</li>
		<li>
it is identified that the incorrect employer from the customer’s existing employer list has been linked to the STP employer</li>

a fix is required to resolve an error that may show when there are multiple employer entries (STP and non-STP) for the same employer and ABN/WPN that is preventing the customer from reporting in self service</li>
		<li>
the previously confirmed status appears incomplete, for example <strong>Status</strong>, <strong>Confirmed On</strong> and/or <strong>Linked Employer</strong> fields are blank</li>

<p>The <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow must be run to either re-confirm or reject the employer status. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-03.html#bp03_tbl_STP_Employer_Up_3">Item 3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the workflow is run to reject the link of an incorrect employer, the workflow must be run again to re-confirm the STP Employer and link to the correct employer. Staff cannot reject and confirm in the same transaction. Each action must be completed separately before the next action can occur.</p>

<p>To resolve errors, including <strong>E009EA - You cannot enter a duplicate ABN/WPN</strong> and <strong>E016CQ - Details for this type of income already exist</strong> when multiple entries of the same employer and ABN/WPN exist, complete these steps&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Review the employer and ABN entries on <strong>EANS</strong>. Identify all matching employer entries</li>
		<li>
Identify the correct employer entry. Things to consider are&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Do any of the employer entries have an <strong>Employer Verification</strong> status of '<strong>STP</strong>'?</li>
			<li>
Is there a recently added employer entry with <strong>Employer Verification</strong> status of <strong>STP</strong> when there was already an existing employer entry with income coded?</li>
			<li>
Earliest income recorded and volume of data on each employer entry</li>
			<li>
Evidence of previously verified employment income (for example, random samples survey, employment income reviews)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Once determined that an incorrect employer was selected, or duplicated employer details are causing <strong>E009EA</strong>, reject the STP employer details on <strong>EMCF</strong> and then re-confirm</li>
		<li>
Run the <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow</li>
		<li>
If <strong>EMCF</strong> shows multiple employers with the same ABN on the <strong>Employment Income data</strong> table&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
go to <strong>EANS</strong></li>
			<li>
select <strong>edit</strong> for the employer that is not STP verified and remove the ABN, select <strong>Save</strong> and go back to <strong>EMCF</strong></li>		</ul>
		<li>
From <strong>EMCF</strong>, select the <strong>edit</strong> button to <strong>reject</strong> the current STP employer status, select <strong>Save</strong> and finalise the activity</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If <strong>E016CQ</strong> occurs, check if there is another employer entry on <strong>EANS</strong> with the duplicated ABN. If so, make sure the ABN is updated on <strong>EANS</strong> before making updates to <strong>EMCF</strong>, or if there is no ABN duplication</li>
			<li>
Check there was an existing employer entry on <strong>EANS</strong> for the STP employer. After rejecting the employer status on <strong>EMCF</strong>, it removes the linked ABN to the existing employer that the STP employer was linked to. Copy the ABN from the ABN field on <strong>EMCF</strong> and enter it in the ABN field of the existing employer entry on <strong>EANS</strong>, and select <strong>Save</strong></li>
			<li>
When all troubleshooting has been applied, finalise the activity</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Run the <strong>STP Employer Update</strong> workflow again to <strong>confirm</strong> the employer status and link the correct STP employer. See I<a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-03.html#bp03_tbl_STP_Employer_Up_3">tem 3</a>. Select <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Next</strong></li>
		<li>
When on <strong>EANS</strong>, merge any pay events that were coded on the incorrect or duplicate employer entry onto the correct STP employer entry. To do this, use the Snipping Tool to take a snip of the income details coded on the ‘incorrect or duplicate’ employer. Replicate the coding from the snip onto the STP employer record. When income is merged to the correct STP employer entry, delete the income from the incorrect or duplicate employer. For more help with coding employment income, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a> </li>
		<li>
When all employment income updates have been made, finalise the activity</li>		</ul>

<p>Customers have control over the STP data that is applied in their reporting task. They can adjust the pre-filled details and add pay components that have not pre-filled yet if required, before confirming the STP employment details and continuing with their report.

<p>When STP data is available when reporting, it has a provisional status. Customers can change the pre-filled STP details, if required, before confirming the data. It is important that customers check their payslip/s carefully, if they are unsure about the pre-filled details.</p>

<p>Customers can select <strong>Edit or add pay</strong> to change each pay event that has pre-filled. For example, they can adjust the amount of a pre-filled pay component or add an additional pay component paid in the same pay event. If a customer is paid weekly and only one pay event has pre-filled, they can select <strong>Add pay</strong> to add the second weekly pay event details.</p>

<p>If a customer has more than one STP employer, the details will pre-fill one employer at a time. Customers are required to check and confirm the pre-filled details from the first STP employer, before details from the second STP employer can be shown. Customers can only make updates to the STP data for the employer they are currently reviewing in the workflow.</p>

<p>Customers are not able to declare other non-STP employment income or hours worked while in the STP confirmation service. This can be done after the STP data has been reviewed and accepted, and the customer has continued to the REI service to complete their report.</p>

<p>Employees may have their employment status reported by their STP employer. A full time employment status may pre-fill up to two times of the data first being reported. Customers can select <strong>Edit employment status</strong> to update this, if needed. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the definition of Full time employment is not the same for the ATO and Services Australia.</p>

<p>When the STP declaration is accepted, no more changes to the confirmed pre-filled STP data can be made by the customer.</p>

<p>Customers are directed to the <strong>STP confirmation service</strong> to review and accept or change the pre-filled STP data.

When submitted, customers are not able to make any more changes to the confirmed STP data. If the customer realises after that a separate pay event didn’t pre-fill from their STP employer, the customer can add this in the second part of their report.</p>

<p>If there is more than one STP employer, the STP data will show one employer at a time for the customer to review and confirm. The customer must confirm the STP data paid from the first employer before the employment details reported by the second employer can be shown to review and confirm.</p>

<p>If a customer is paid more than once in a reporting period by their STP employer, the pay events are shown one at a time for the customer to check. For example, Pay 1 of 2, Pay 2 of 2.</p>

However, they are not able to change the STP data that has already been confirmed.</p>

<p>They can add any other employment income paid by non-STP employers for themselves and their partner and report any hours worked, if required. The fortnightly report is only finalised when the customer also submits the REI declaration.</p>

<p>After the customer submits the REI declaration successfully, they will see the Receipt page confirming their report has been finalised. It will include, a receipt number and details of their next payment.</p>

<p>A <strong>DOC</strong> will generate on their record with the captured STP data and other details. If the customer exits the reporting service after only submitting the STP data at the first step, a <strong>DOC</strong> will still generate with the STP data only. If a Service Officer helps the customer complete their reporting, a separate <strong>DOC</strong> is generated. This <strong>DOC</strong> may show <strong>no income declared</strong> if no more income details are added by Service Officers. This is because the customer has already confirmed STP data which can be viewed on <strong>EAPP</strong> and <strong>EMGI</strong>, as well as the earlier <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

Changes on <strong>EMGI</strong> are being correctly applied to <strong>EAPP</strong>. Where duplicated amounts have been adjusted to <strong>0.00</strong>, the income that had mapped to <strong>EAPP</strong> must be deleted</li>
		<li>
Income hasn’t been doubled up from having STP data applied and manually coded income, with <strong>NVE</strong> code. Where manually coded income results in duplication of a pay event, delete the manually added entries. Any updates to cessation payments on <strong>EMGI</strong> may insert a new entry on <strong>IMPS</strong>. Make sure to delete the previous coding that had mapped</li>
		</ul>
<p>If multiple reporting periods need updating, the workflow repeats until all reporting periods have been actioned.</p>

<p>Any changes to confirmed data must be discussed with the customer and noted in a <strong>DOC</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Duplicated STP data</strong></p>

<p>Where a customer has accepted pay events that have been duplicated, evidence is not required <strong>when it is clear</strong> the data has been duplicated. Service Officers must <strong>Update past periods</strong> and zero out each duplicated pay component on <strong>EMGI</strong> so that only the singular pay event remains.</p>

<p>Once <strong>Accept income</strong> is selected, the <strong>Gross STP Income</strong> field will show the duplicated total and the <strong>Gross Income Reported</strong> field will show the correct singular total for the reporting period.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When going to <strong>EAPP</strong>, Service Officers must delete the duplicated components so only the singular pay event remains, as system functionality doesn’t allow a correction of <strong>$0</strong> to be inserted.</p>

<p>Service Officers using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct <strong>must add notes</strong> about any changes made before finalising the reporting activity. Staff <strong>must</strong> also consider <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Request_informa04_Step04">requesting payslips</a> where the customer consistently makes changes to the pre-filled STP data that is reported by the employer.</p>

<p>STP data reported by employers to the ATO is prepared by Services Australia in near real time to pre-fill in reporting channels. For more details, see Data and Digital Gateway.</p>

<p>The below circumstances may result in STP data not pre-filling in a reporting statement&#58;</p>

		<li>
the customer has previously had an employment type of <strong>SWS</strong>, <strong>ADE</strong>, <strong>AOE</strong>, <strong>SAC</strong>, <strong>PSS</strong> or <strong>PSG</strong> recorded on <strong>EANS</strong>. STP data will only pre-fill in a customer’s report when there is only an <strong>EAR</strong> employment type on <strong>EANS</strong>. (STP data would then only be accessed through staff assisted reporting in Process Direct)</li>
		<li>
the confirmed STP employer reports payroll later on the day that the customer reports. This may include where one weekly pay event is pre-filled, but a second weekly pay event is not available</li>
		<li>
the confirmed STP employer has not reported payroll yet when the customer reports early due to a public holiday or travelling overseas. Employers may delay reporting payroll during shutdown periods</li>
		<li>
inconsistent reporting dates from the employer</li>
		<li>
missing data attributes resulting in filtering out of pay events</li>

<p>Depending on when a customer reports, there may be times when all pay events paid in the reporting period are not pre-filled. The most common scenarios are where customers are paid weekly, or fortnightly payroll which is reported by the employer to the ATO on the same day the customer reports.</p>

<p>Customers who are paid weekly by their STP employer, may have only one pay event pre-filled at the time of their report. Even if an employer has reported their payroll data on the same day, the STP data needs time to be prepared for it to pre-fill.</p>

<p>The customer must add pay details that haven’t pre-filled. In some cases, it may be appropriate to discuss with the customer about changing their reporting day. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-05030000-01.html">Changing Entitlement Period End Dates (EPED)</a></p>

<p>Unused leave and termination payments may pre-fill in a reporting task when a customer ceases work. The cessation date and reason may also pre-fill. The cessation reason cannot be changed. Customers subject to mutual obligation requirements will be required to give an explanation of why they ceased work, when the cessation reason is voluntary or dismissal. Service Officers must manually generate a <strong>UNPP</strong>, where required.</p>

<p>When customers are reporting through self service channels, they will be asked to give the number of days the unused leave or termination payments are paid for, or their average weekly wage. This will determine the duration of an <strong>Income Maintenance Period</strong> (<strong>IMP</strong>) for customers and/or partners on an <strong>IMP</strong> affected payment.</p>

<p>For staff using the <strong>Earnings and Reporting</strong> workflow, enter the start and end dates for the duration of each of the cessation payments, as advised by the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
select <strong>edit </strong>for the <strong>cessation payment/s</strong> component</li>
		<li>
enter the start date for the period in <strong>Adjusted Period Start Date </strong>field</li>
		<li>
enter the end date for the period in <strong>Adjusted Period End Date </strong>field</li>
		<li>
select <strong>Save</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p>Staff must make sure the duration provided is reasonable. for example, for an unused leave payment of $900 (annual leave), a 1 day duration would be considered unreasonable, but 5 days would be reasonable.</p>

<p>Verification, such as an SU1, payslip or letter form the employer is required where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer makes changes to the cessation payments</li>
		<li>
there is doubt about the number of days/duration provided.</li>
		</ul>
<p>When unused leave or redundancy payments are pre-filled, the confirmed data will map to the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen when a cessation date and reason are also pre-filled. Customers or their partners who are not subject to an Income Maintenance Period assessment will not be affected by the coding on the <strong>IMPS</strong> screen.</p>

<p>Where unused leave and/or redundancy payments are pre-filled and there is no cessation reason and date reported, the amounts will map to <strong>EAPP</strong>. For customers reporting online, they will be asked if they are still working for the employer. If they answer <strong>No</strong>, an online task is created to provide an SU1. When the SU1 is returned, the employment cessation details can be updated, as needed. Customers who are not subject to an <strong>IMP</strong> will also be asked <strong>Do you need to advise of any change to your income and assets details?</strong> in the reporting workflow, to prompt them to update their circumstances. If they answer <strong>Yes</strong>, a new <strong>Update your income and assets</strong> task is added in self service.</p>

<p>When a customer has confirmed ceasing employment with the STP employer, the <strong>Employer verification</strong> field on <strong>EANS</strong> will update from <strong>STP</strong> to <strong>STC</strong>.</p>

<p>Compensation reported through STP will update to <strong>EAPP</strong> for the first 2 reporting periods when there are no compensation details recorded for that employer on the Compensation Management Summary (<strong>CMS</strong>) screen. This allows time for the customer to provide a MOD C and for it to be assessed by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT).</p>

<p>Where compensation income has already been assessed on CMS and the amount has updated to <strong>EAPP</strong>, it may be how the employer has reported it to the ATO. Compensation components should be reported as <strong>Paid leave - worker’s compensation</strong>. If it has been reported as <strong>Salary and Wages – Income Gross Amount</strong>, adjust the pre-filled amount to <strong>0.00</strong> and consider escalating through mySupport.
