<p><strong>Q999 - Primary claimant only has lodged a claim - customer is transferring their full PPL entitlement and has returned to work before lodging PPL claim</strong></p>

<p>'In your claim you indicated that you have returned to work and intend to transfer your full Parental Leave Pay entitlement to another person. Before we finalise your claim for Parental Leave Pay, the person you intend to transfer your payment to, must lodge their claim. If they do not lodge their claim within 14 days of this notice being issued, Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for &lt;child's name&gt;.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 NEF text to secondary claimant - primary claimant did not submit an effective PPL claim</strong></p>

<p>'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; has not submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for &lt;CHILD NAME&gt; you will need to contact us once &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; has submitted their claim.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 NEF text to primary claimant - secondary claimant did not submit an effective PPL claim</strong></p>

<p>'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to&gt; has not submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for &lt;CHILD NAME&gt; you will need to contact us once &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to &gt; has submitted their claim.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 text to secondary claimant when claim cannot be finalised until closer to the PPL nominated start date</strong></p>

<p>'As the nominated start for your Parental Leave Pay is not until &lt;date&gt;, we cannot finalise your claim until &lt;Nominated Start Date&gt;. If &lt;your partner&gt;&lt;the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you&gt; changes their nominated start date for the Paid Parental Leave to an earlier date, you will need to contact us on 136 150 so we can assess your claim sooner.'</p>

<p><strong>Q999 NEF text to Secondary Claimant when Secondary claimant is applying for PPL and primary claimant has not transferred any PPL period or Flexible PPL days to them (pre-birth claims only)</strong></p>

<p>'In your claim you indicated that you are claiming Parental Leave Pay.</p>

<p>We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because no-one has transferred any Paid Parental Leave to you. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for your newborn you will need to lodge a new claim for Paid Parental Leave if your partner transfers some of their entitlement to you.'</p>

<p>If you wish to claim Dad and Partner Pay, go to Servicesaustralia.gov.au and search Dad and Partner Pay to test your eligibility.'</p>

<p><strong>Birth mother not eligible due to work test</strong></p>

<p>Sarah and Rob are expecting their first child. Sarah enquires about making a per-birth claim for PPL.</p>

<p>Sarah has not been working and does not meet the work test. Sarah enquires if partner Rob is eligible for PPL instead.</p>

<p>Rob works and has arranged to take leave from work to be at home to care for their newborn child and support Sarah.</p>

<p>As the birth mother, Sarah must be assessed as the primary claimant for PPL unless exceptional circumstance criteria are met. As Sarah intends on caring for the newborn child and is capable of doing so, exceptional circumstances are not met. Sarah must first meet all the eligibility as a primary claimant if Sarah wanted to transfer the PPL to Rob.</p>

<p>PPL provides birth mothers who have been in the work force with the opportunity to take time off work to care for their newborn child and to recover following the birth.</p>

<p>Sarah is advised that the Newborn Supplement and Newborn Upfront Payment is available. Sarah is invited to claim and test eligibility for Family Tax Benefit (FTB). As Sarah’s partner Rob is taking time off work, Sarah is also advised about the possibility of Rob claiming Dad and Partner Pay.</p>

<p>Julie is still capable of caring for their baby.</p>

<p>John's PPL claim is rejected reason '<strong>PPC</strong>', due to not being considered the primary claimant.</p>

<p>On 21 August, Julie submits an online claim and provides all information required to assess the claim, including work test and income test information. The FA081 lodged by John can be used as proof of the child's birth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as the baby is unwell for the first 3 days of term, Naomi is unable to leave the baby at child care and applies for carer leave for this period. Naomi has access to 2 days paid carer leave and takes the third day as unpaid carer leave. Naomi starts work on the fourth day of the term.</p>

<p>As Naomi has not performed one hour or more of paid work prior to the fourth day of term, the fourth day is the return to work date. Naomi’s PPL period is paid up to the fourth day of term as she is not considered to have worked on days 1 to 3. </p>

<p>In the PPL claim, Fiona indicates that Fiona transferred primary care of the child to partner Philip, on 20 July and returned to work on the same day. Fiona also wishes to transfer the full PPL period and give permission to claim all 30 Flexible PPL days to Philip from 1 August.</p>

<p>Fiona meets all PPL eligibility for each day from the child's date of birth, up to and including 19 July (the day before Fiona returned to work). As Fiona is eligible for PPL, Fiona's full PPL entitlement can be transferred to Philip. Before Philip can be paid PPL for the child Phillip must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
submit an effective claim at the same time as Fiona</li>
		<li>
be eligible for PPL as a secondary claimant, and</li>
		<li>
satisfy the full PPL eligibility criteria from 20 July, when Phillip became the child's primary carer</li>
		</ul>
<p>Before finalising Fiona's claim for PPL, Philip's claim must be lodged. As Philip has not lodged a claim, a Q999 must be sent to Fiona advising that Philip must submit a claim for PPL within 14 days. If Philip does not submit a claim within the timeframe it may not meet the 'lodged at the same time' criteria. Fiona's claim for PPL will be finalised and deemed not effective with a reason of '<strong>OTH</strong>'er.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer full PPL entitlement to secondary claimant from a date after the child's date of birth - secondary claimant only has claimed</strong></p>

<p>Lisa has a baby on 20 September. Lisa's partner, Steve, lodges a claim for PPL on 20 October.</p>

<p>In the PPL claim, Steve advises of claiming PPL because Lisa is transferring the full PPL period to Steve. Before assessing Steve's claim, a Q999 must be sent to Steve advising that Lisa must submit a claim for PPL within 14 days before Steve's entitlement to PPL can be assessed. </p>

<p>On 2 November, Lisa lodges a claim for PPL and in the claim indicates that Lisa has returned to work and transferred primary care of their child to Steve on 16 October. Lisa also advises the intention to transfer the full PPL period and all 30 Flexible PPL days to Steve from 16 October.</p>

<p>As the primary claimant's claim must be assessed before the secondary claimant's claim, the Service Officer assesses Lisa's claim first and establishes Lisa meets the relevant PPL eligibility criteria from the child's date of birth up to and including 15 October (the day before returning to work). Lisa's claim is finalised with&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a PPL period level rejection <strong>REJ-TFR</strong> due to transferring the PPL period, and</li>
		<li>
<strong>PPL/CZR-FLX</strong> as the Flexible PPL days are current with a balance of zero unclaimed days and 30 days given to another person</li>
		</ul>
<p>As Lisa's claim has been finalised, Steve's claim can now be assessed.</p>

<p>Until Steve claims all 30 Flexible PPL days, Lisa can remove permission and claim the days for dates when the child is in Lisa’s primary care.</p>

<p>Melissa and Daniel’s child Alfie was born prematurely on 1 February. Following the birth, Alfie remained in hospital until 3 March.</p>

<p>Daniel was Alfie’s primary carer from birth. Melissa and Daniel both returned to work on 10 February. On 3 March, when Alfie was released from hospital, Daniel finished work to care for Alfie. Melissa transferred the full PPL entitlement to Daniel and nominated a start date of 3 March. As Daniel is not the birth mother Daniel's return to work within the 14 days following Alfie’s date of birth can be disregarded. Provided Melissa meets the eligibility criteria for a full transfer of PPL and Daniel meets the other eligibility criteria for PPL as a secondary claimant, Daniel is eligible for PPL.</p>
