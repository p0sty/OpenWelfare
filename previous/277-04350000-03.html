<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; excess cash amounts less than $5.00 cannot be refunded or gifted unless the case has ended.</p>

<p>Excess cash on a payee’s account generally occurs because they had a previous role as payer or the return of a disbursement.<strong> </strong>See <a href="../separated-parents/277-06010000-01.html">Disbursements of Child Support</a>.</p>

<p>Check the customer’s Collection Summary window to determine the source of the payment, for example the payer, EW, s72A notice.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; seek SO5 assistance before remitting and refunding paid late payment penalties (LPP). Remitting and refunding paid LPP’s draws funds from consolidated revenue. The criteria for remitting LPP’s must be met otherwise this is not an authorised use of consolidated revenue.</p>

<p>If unable to confirm the source of the payment, escalate to a SO5 to get advice before proceeding.</p>

<p>If the payment was received&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>before</strong> 1 November 2004 there is no historical data available to confirm the source of payment, continue to finalise any outstanding issues</li>

<strong>after</strong> 1 November 2004, refer to Payment Services before refunding excess cash&#58;</li>

continue to finalise outstanding issues</li>

<p>Payment Services will create a Payment Response intray and provide a response within 2 working days.</p>

<p>If there is a bankruptcy indicator on the customer’s record and the bankruptcy trustee is the source of the excess cash, <strong>before</strong> making a refund decision seek SSO assistance to determine how it should be resolved.

<p>If the customer is on the phone, tell them outstanding issues should be finalised before a refund can issue. This is to ensure the account is accurate and reduce the chance of them incurring a future debt or receiving a payment they are not entitled to.</p>

<p>If the customer insists on their refund, advise them that any future changes could create a debt.</p>

<p>In making the decision to refund excess cash, consider the facts of each case. Encourage customers to update all information prior to processing the refund. Child Support has no legal basis to refuse to refund the excess cash. If considering <strong>not refunding</strong> the excess cash, seek assistance from a SO5.</p>

<p>Before taking action about the excess cash, finalise outstanding issues and intrays that may affect the accuracy of either customers’ accounts.</p>

<p>Examples of outstanding issues are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a href="../separated-parents/277-04230000-01.html">non-agency payment (NAP)</a> including previous prescribed NAP have been assigned correctly</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> estimates lodged before 2010 were for 15 months. These estimates do not need to be reconciled before a refund is authorised. Tell the customer the estimate may be reconciled in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Run eligibility to give effect to these changes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> do not run eligibility because if there are no events being processed, Cuba will do a data check back to the Start Date of Liability. A liability recalculation will occur which could lead to unexpected results.</p>

<p>See View, pend and save Eligibility results in <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010310-01.html">Eligibility Cuba Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>Check the results of the changes in the Pre-confirmation results dialogue box in the Eligibility window.</p>

<p>A reasonable amount of time would be, for example 7 days because this would be enough time to follow-up any issues in progress such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
obtain a final piece of information to make a NAP decision</li>
		<li>
perform an estimate reconciliation or review</li>
		<li>
find ATO information to replace income</li>
		</ul>
<p>However, this must be assessed on an individual case by case basis. Use discretion when deciding on the reasonable amount of time before proceeding.</p>

<p>If unsure if the refund should proceed or further assistance is required before finalising the outstanding issues, seek assistance from an SSO. See<strong> </strong><a href="../separated-parents/277-09140000-01.html">Technical support in Child Support</a>.</p>

<p>Refunds are paid to customers by direct credit. This is the most efficient, reliable, secure and cost effective way of disbursing funds.</p>

<p>Make sure refunds are processed into an account in the customer’s name. Refunds cannot be made into an account held by a third party.</p>

<p>Pend the Refund. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010540-01.html">Refunds Cuba Process Help</a>. Use the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/ExcessCashRefund.html">Gifts and Refunds - excess cash management</a> macro to document request in the <strong>Refund Details</strong> window.</p>

<p>If the customer has a bank account recorded in the bank details window in Cuba and has asked to be refunded to a different account, change the Direct Credit ellipse button details.</p>

<p>On the same day as request, route the <strong>Refund for Approval</strong> intray to an SSO for authorisation.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; seek SSO assistance before remitting and refunding paid late payment penalties (LPP). Remitting and refunding paid LPP’s draws funds from consolidated revenue. The criteria for remitting LPP’s must be met otherwise this is not an authorised use of consolidated revenue.</p>

<p><strong>Error message</strong></p>

<p>In some cases staff may be unable to refund excess cash amounts and will receive an error message ‘3225 – The refund total cannot exceed payments received less refunds paid’. There is no need to report this via mySupport. Service Officers should seek SSO assistance. Only APS5 can reallocate cash.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; debt offsets are included in the calculation of the total payments received. Check the debt offset amount before proceeding with the refund. Non-cash credits, such as NAPs are not refundable.</p>

<p>Work around directions for SO5 to action the refund&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Access the customer who has the excess cash via the <strong>Customer Production</strong> window</li>
		<li>
Access the customer’s case via the Involvement window as the <strong>Payee </strong>not as the <strong>Payer</strong> </li>
		<li>
Re-allocate the available payee cash from excess cash to Maintenance Debt. A Cuba warning message 2701 will show. Despite the warning, <strong>Cuba will permit</strong> the requested action. This will re-allocate the excess cash and create the same amount again as a Maintenance entitlement. The money will now appear as excess cash on the other parent’s account and as a maintenance liability equal to the cash transferred back</li>
		<li>
Exit the case window back to the original customer and switch customers, that is go to the parent who now has both excess cash and a maintenance debt</li>
		<li>
Access the case window where the customer who now has the excess cash is the <strong>Payer</strong></li>
		<li>
Re-allocate the excess cash to maintenance debt. This should result in a nil balance for all parties. The customer that originally had the excess cash now showing a disbursement to be made to them as a <strong>Payee</strong> equal to the amount of excess cash that was re-allocated</li>
		<li>
The undisbursed maintenance should automatically disburse by Cuba overnight.</li>
		<li>
Check the case the next day. If the disbursement did not take place, make a manual disbursement</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>International </strong></p>

<p>Process any money under excess cash as a refund. Generally funds that are under excess cash are funds that are processed back onto a customer’s account from National Financial Management after being returned as a rejected disbursement, a stopped cheque or the funds returned from Centrelink for various reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Does the customer have an Australian bank account?</strong></p>
