		<div class="block">

<p>For Medicare Compensation Recovery purposes, compensation is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a payment of damages</li>
		<li>
a payment under an insurance scheme, or compensation under law</li>
		<li>
a payment (with or without admission of liability) resulting from judgment or settlement of a claim for damages or a claim under an insurance scheme</li>
		<li>
any other compensation or damages payment, other than a payment under a scheme to where the recipient has contributed. For example, life insurance or superannuation</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; a claim against a life insurance policy, or superannuation scheme where the injured person contributed is not notifiable under the HOSC Act.</p>

<p><strong>Compensation does not include</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a payment by an individual who is not insured, is indemnified against any liability for the injury, and who is <strong>not</strong> required by law to be insured or indemnified</li>
		<li>
a criminal injuries compensation payment, see <a href="../your-health/011-15020000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Exgratia_payme">Ex-gratia payments</a></li>
		<li>
a voluntary payment which (whether on its own or in conjunction with other such payments) has the effect of extinguishing by agreement a claim for compensation</li>
		<li>
a payment of a kind, or in circumstances prescribed by the regulations</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; an individual is taken to be insured or otherwise indemnified from liability if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the individual is a member of a representative organisation, and</li>
		<li>
the representative organisation bears liability for paying on behalf of the individual member</li>

<p>A notifiable person must tell Services Australia (the agency) in writing if a compensation claim for an injury or illness to a person results in a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
judgment or settlement, if compensation was fixed for more than $5,000</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for settlements (includes legal costs) – see Claims with settlement amount for legal costs only below</li>
			<li>
for judgments, (does not include legal costs)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
reimbursement arrangement, agreed more than 6 months after the date the compensation claim was lodged with the notifiable person</li>
		</ul>
<p>Examples&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A settlement made for $4,600 plus legal costs of $500 = notifiable ($5,100 compensation)</li>
		<li>
A judgment made for $5,000 plus legal costs of $500 = not notifiable ($5,000 compensation)</li>
		<li>
A compensation claim made on 1 February 2022 and reimbursement arrangement made on 1 October 2022 = notifiable (8 months)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Claims with a settlement amount for legal costs only</strong></p>

<p>The claim is not notifiable under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSC Act), if a settlement amount is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
only the legal costs associated with pursuing the compensation claim, and </li>
		<li>
does <strong>not include payment</strong> for the injury/illness</li>
		</ul>
<p>Evidence must be provided to the agency to confirm this, such as the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Terms of settlement</li>
		<li>
Deed of release, or </li>
		<li>
legal costs invoice</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>court documents may be required to determine the amount of damages excluding costs for some judgments.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer is unsure if a compensation claim should be registered, get advice from a Local Peer Support (LPS), and the claim can be escalated to Programme Management for a decision. See <a href="../your-health/011-15040000-01.html">Escalations and case notes</a>. </p>

<p>If a claim is determined to be not notifiable, create a provisional record and issue a You do not need to tell us about the compensation claim/reimbursement arrangement letter (Z2797). See <a href="../your-health/011-15040010-01.html">Search for or update an existing claim or register a new claim</a>.</p>

<p>If a claim is determined to be not notifiable and has previously been registered, see <a href="../your-health/011-15040040-01.html">Close, terminate or reopen a claim</a> to terminate the claim and send a You do not need to tell us about a compensation claim/reimbursement arrangement letter (Z2797).</p>

<p>If a company name or medical practitioner’s name is given as the notifiable person this can be accepted to register the claim if the request is signed by the notifiable person or their solicitor. Some large companies are self-insured.</p>

<p>If signed by any other party, contact the person submitting the request to ask for insurer or agent details. If there is</p>

<p><strong>Individual(s)</strong></p>

<p>If the notifiable person is listed as an individual(s) contact the person submitting the request to ask for insurer details and/or requirement to be insured. Where advised that the claim has&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
insurance but these details are not disclosed by the defendants</li>
		<li>
no insurance, but the defendant is required to be insured, or</li>
		<li>

<p>As the claim progresses to settlement, the notification requirements should become clearer.</p>

<p>Notifiable claims</p>

insured even if not required to be, or</li>

<p>If there is more than one notifiable person, see <a href="../your-health/011-15050000-01.html">Payments, refunds and debts</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Not notifiable claims</strong></p>

<p>Section 4 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 defines that a claim would not be notifiable if compensation was payment by a person not insured and not required by law to be insured.</p>

<p>After settlement, if in doubt about claims where there is no insurer involved, refer to Programme Management to determine if the claim is notifiable. If Programme Management confirm the claim is not notifiable issue a You do not need to tell us about the compensation claim/reimbursement arrangement letter (Z2797).</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Wrongful deaths are usually the result of an accident caused by the misconduct of another person or company. For example, wrongful death claims are lodged for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
malpractice (for example, professional negligence by a doctor or health care worker)</li>
		<li>
unsafe premises</li>
		<li>
unsafe working practices</li>
		<li>
unsafe machinery, operations or faulty equipment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Australian State and Territory legislation make provisions for wrongful deaths, for example, worker's compensation. Claims lodged under State or Territory legislation may also be pursued by the estate of the deceased or family members under other legislation, for example common law.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; do not confuse claims lodged for wrongful deaths with fatal injuries, or claims lodged under the legislation specific to criminal injuries.</p>

<p><strong>Notifiable claims</strong></p>

<p>Claims are notifiable if they include claims for medical services for the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deceased injured person</li>
		<li>
family member making the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>A claim may be lodged under both workers' compensation and common law for personal injuries sustained by either the deceased or family members and these claims are notifiable.</p>

<p><strong>Claims that are not notifiable</strong></p>

<p>Wrongful death claims are not notifiable when the claim is not for personal injury. For example, the family or estate of a deceased&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
worker, who dies as a result of a car accident while driving a company vehicle, the estate may lodge a claim for wrongful death against the employer because the employer failed to maintain the vehicle in proper mechanical repair</li>
		<li>
person, who was attacked in the car park of a shopping centre may sue the shopping centre management or owners for failing to provide adequate security in the car park</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; a claim may also be pursued under Criminal Injury Compensation as well as wrongful death.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer is unsure if a compensation claim should be registered, get advice from a Local Peer Support (LPS), and the claim can be escalated to Programme Management. </p>

<p>If Service Delivery or Programme Management determine the claim is <strong>not</strong> notifiable, issue a You do not need to tell us about the compensation claim/reimbursement arrangement letter (Z2797).</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>An ex-gratia payment is made voluntarily, out of kindness or grace and there is no obligation or legal liability for the giver to pay compensation. Examples include disaster assistance payments from government organisations or Australians affected by past terrorism acts overseas.</p>

<p>A true ex-gratia payment does not extinguish the injured person’s legal right to claim compensation from the person who makes the payment. The injured person is normally not required to sign a deed of release that extinguishes their rights to future compensation.</p>

<p>A claim is notifiable under the HOSC Act and must be registered in MCRS if any of the following legal documents were signed by the injured person, which releases the compensation payer from liability to make future payments as this is not an ex-gratia payment&#58;</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A claim is notifiable under the HOSC Act if all or part of the amount of compensation is part of a redemption of an entitlement to compensation by periodic payments. A worker can agree to give up their ongoing entitlement to weekly payments and medical expenses in exchange for a lump sum payment (compensation). This is different to a lump sum payment for permanent impairment.</p>

<p>However, the claim is <strong>not</strong> notifiable <strong>if the law prohibits</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
redemption of future medical and care expenses </li>
		<li>
inclusion of past medical and care expenses </li>
		</ul>
<p>For example, a settlement that is a redemption of an entitlement to periodic payments made under sections 30 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (SRC Act) would not be notifiable under the HOSC Act. </p>

<p><strong>Compensation recipient is liable to repay regardless of location </strong></p>

<p>A person who has received a notifiable compensation payment must repay the Australian Government amounts paid for Medicare benefits and care costs that were related to the compensated injury or illness. </p>

<p><strong>Australian jurisdiction</strong></p>

<p>The Australian Government is limited in its legal ability to exercise authority beyond its normal borders in other countries. Australian jurisdiction covers all States and Territories including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the Australian Antarctic Territory</li>
		<li>
the Jervis Bay Territory</li>

Coral Sea Islands</li>

<p>When the agency gets the judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement documents, it will decide if the compensation claim is notifiable under Australian law and the HOSC Act. Only Australian courts or compensation authorities for the purposes of the HOSC Act (or overseas equivalents of courts) can make a judgment. For example, Comcare is not a ‘compensation authority’ for the purposes of the Act. </p>

<p><strong>Shortfalls payable by the injured person or claimant</strong></p>

<p>The agency cannot enforce the recovery of any amounts owed if a compensation payer is located outside of Australian jurisdiction if the injury or illness occurred overseas. They are not subject to Australian law and are not required to notify the agency of a compensation claim.</p>

<p>However, if the overseas compensation payer pays any amount toward a notice of charge, or if an advance payment is made, any shortfall in the amount owed may be pursued by the agency from the injured person. </p>

<p>Each compensation claim must be assessed on a case by case basis. If a Service Officer is unsure whether a compensation claim should be registered, seek advice from a Local Peer Support (LPS) and escalate the claim to Programme Management.

<p>The Transport Accident Commission (TAC) is a Victorian Government owned organisation that will pay all reasonable medical treatment costs, above a certain threshold, for personal injuries sustained in a transport accident in Victoria. </p>

<p>It is a no-fault scheme and medical benefits will be paid to an injured person regardless of who caused the accident. </p>

<p>A claim against the TAC can also be made if a Victorian resident or person is injured in an interstate accident that involves a Victorian registered vehicle. </p>

<p>If the injured person lives in Victoria and the accident happened in Victoria, the claim is likely to be <strong>Medical Excess only</strong> and the agency does not process or register these claims. If the injured person lives in any other Australian State or Territory, the claim is likely to be proceeding under common law. Common law claims must be registered as they are governed under different legislation to Victoria for motor vehicle accident claims.</p>

<p><strong>Notifiable claims</strong></p>

<p>A claim against the TAC is notifiable if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an amount of compensation has been fixed for more than $5,000 by a judgment (excluding costs) or settlement (including costs)</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Claims that are not notifiable</strong></p>

<p>A claim against the TAC is not notifiable if&#58;</p>

		<li>
The claim is subject to a reimbursement arrangement made within 6 months from the date the injured person lodged the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a Service Officer is unsure if a compensation claim should be registered, get advice from a Local Peer Support (LPS), and the claim can be escalated to Programme Management. </p>

<p>If Service Delivery or Programme Management determine the claim is <strong>not</strong> notifiable, issue a You do not need to tell us about the compensation claim/reimbursement arrangement letter (Z2797).</p>

<p>If a TAC claim is registered on the Medicare National Compensation Recovery Information (<strong>NCRI</strong>) mainframe screen, any patient claims presented for payment are flagged with a return message and are unable to be processed until the Service Officer (whether in a branch office or on-line claims) contacts Medicare Compensation Recovery.</p>
