<p>Maria has been employed as a casual school teacher for the last 3 years and is expecting to give birth on 10 September 2020. Maria's work test period is 15 August 2019 to 10 September 2020. On average, Maria works 25 hours per week. As a casual school teacher. Maria was on unpaid leave from 2 May 2020 until starting a new contract on 7 August 2020 (98 days).</p>

<p>Maria has had a break in employment of more than 84 days (12 weeks) within the PPL qualifying period (295 days -approx. 10 months) and it is not a permissible break. Maria does not meet the work test and is not eligible for PPL. Maria is entitled to Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) assessed with Family Tax Benefit (FTB).</p></td>

<p><strong>Including previous periods of PPL in the customer's work test/qualifying period</strong></p>

<p>Kim and Brad had their first child, Kate, on 14 July 2019. PPL was paid for Kate from 14 July 2019 through to 16 November 2019. Kim returned to work on 11 January 2020.</p>

<p>In March 2020, Kim and Brad find out they are expecting their second child, with a due date of 22 October 2020.</p>

<p>Kim lodges a pre-birth claim for PPL on 10 October 2020. Kim's PPL work test period for Kim’s second child is 26 September 2019 to 22 October 2020 (13 months or 392 days). In the pre-birth claim, Kim advised of ceasing work on 22 August 2020. Kim did not perform 8 hours of qualifying work every week during the PPL work test period. Evidence was requested and payslips were provided by Kim.</p>

<p>The payslips confirm Kim completed on average, 6 hours per week paid work from 11 January 2020 to 22 August 2020. As Kim's previous PPL falls within the current PPL work test, some of these days can be included when determining if Kim meets the current PPL Work Test. The Service Officer determines Kim's 10 month (295 days) qualifying period to be 26 September 2019 to 17 July 2020. By using this period, the Service Officer can include Kim's previous PPL period from 26 September 2019 - 16 November 2019, (266 hours). These hours, added with Kim's paid work within the qualifying period, exceeds the 330 hours work required to meet the PPL work test for the expected child.</p></td>

<p><strong>Pregnancy-related complications</strong></p>

<p>Jo had a history of miscarriages during the first trimester of pregnancy. When Jo became pregnant again, the doctor advised taking a period of leave from employment. Jo followed the doctor's advice and took leave without pay from the full-time job of 6 years to minimise the possibility of another miscarriage.</p>

<p>After 99 days of leave without pay, Jo returned to work full-time. Despite working in excess of 330 hours of qualifying work, Jo had a break of greater than 84 consecutive days (equivalent to 12 weeks) between 2 qualifying work days. As a result, Jo had a non-permissible break and did not satisfy the normal work test.</p>

<p>However, a medical certificate was provided, confirming Jo was unfit for work due to complications with the pregnancy. Jo's employer also advised that Jo would have worked during the period. As a result, Jo has met the work test when the evidence of the complications with the pregnancy were considered.</p></td>

<p><strong>Pregnancy-related complications</strong></p>

<p>During pregnancy Jean developed severe vomiting and nausea that prevented Jean from working as a casual teacher. Jean's doctor advised Jean to take a period of leave from employment. Due to being unwell, Jean followed the doctor's advice and took leave without pay from Jean’s casual job of 3 years.</p>

<p>As Jean's condition did not improve Jean did not return to work and therefore had only performed 85 days of qualifying work during the work test period. Jean had a break of greater than 84 consecutive days (equivalent to 12 weeks) between 2 qualifying work days. As a result Jean had a non-permissible break and did not satisfy the normal work test.</p>

<p>Jean was requested to and provided a letter from Jean’s medical practitioner that confirmed Jean was unfit for work due to excessive vomiting and dehydration as a result of the pregnancy. Jean was also requested to provide evidence from the employer to confirm Jean would have worked during the work test period had it not been for the pregnancy related illness. Jean contacted the agency to advise that the employer has refused to provide the evidence. As a result of this, Jean's application was rejected as the agency could not be satisfied that Jean would have worked the required time had it not been for the pregnancy related illness. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers will generally be asked to provide this evidence as part of their claim. </p>

<p>If they cannot provide sufficient detail within the claim, Service Officers can contact the employer at the request of the customer. Information can be obtained verbally if customers cannot get evidence in writing.</p></td>

<p><strong>Insufficient medical evidence</strong></p>

<p>Penny was expecting a baby on 15 May.</p>

<p>During the PPL work test period Penny was working full time in a job that required Penny to stand for long periods of time and involved some heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Due to standing for long periods of time Penny experienced back, leg and hand pain which seemed to get worse as the pregnancy progressed.</p>

<p>As a result, Penny decided to start maternity leave earlier than expected. Penny ceased work on 11 January.</p>

<p>As Penny had a non-permissible break of more than 84 consecutive days (equivalent to 12 weeks) between 2 qualifying workdays, the normal work test was not satisfied, and Penny's PPL claim was rejected.</p>

<p>Penny then provided medical evidence from a doctor which listed the reasons why Penny finished work earlier than expected. However, the medical evidence did not state that the complication/illness was exacerbated by pregnancy, and prevented Penny from working. A letter from Penny's employer was also provided saying that Penny would have worked for the period had it not been for the complication/illness.</p>

<p>As the medical evidence did not state that Penny was unfit for work due to the complication/illness being exacerbated by the pregnancy, the agency could not be satisfied Penny met section 36A.</p>

<p>If Penny was to provide additional medical evidence that confirms the complication/illness was exacerbated by the pregnancy which prevented Penny working, the agency could reassess Penny's claim.</p></td>

<p>Danielle is expecting to give birth to another child on 20 October 2021. Danielle's work test period for the expected child is 23 September 2020 to 20 October 2021 (392 days from the expected date of birth).</p>

<p><strong>Permissible break within the work test period</strong></p>

<p>Louise is expecting to give birth on 13 January 2021.</p>

<p>Louise's 392 day work test period starts on 18 December 2019. Louise did not work on this day.</p>

<p>Louise worked for 1 day on 1 November 2019 and then worked continuously from 31 December 2019 to 13 October 2020.</p>

<p>To satisfy the work test, Louise needs to establish a qualifying period of 295 consecutive days between&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the start of the work test period, 18 December 2019, and</li>
		<li>
when ceasing work on 13 October 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p>As Louise performed qualifying work on 1 November 2019 and on 31 December 2019 and, as the period between these dates was less than 84 days, Louise can be considered to have been on a permissible break between the start of the work test period on 18 December 2019, and the day qualifying work was performed on 31 December 2019.</p>

<p>As a permissible break counts towards the work test, Louise is considered to have worked 300 days between 18 December 2019 and 13 October 2020. Therefore, if the requirement for 330 hours of qualifying work is met, and there are no gaps of more than 56 days between any consecutive working days, Louise would meet the work test.

<p>Vicki is a self-employed professional boxer. After learning of the pregnancy, Vicki was required to stop working immediately due to the hazards the job presented to the pregnancy, and in accordance with the industry's regulations. Vicki's last day at work was 5 December 2019.</p>

<p>The expected date of birth of Vicki's baby is 5 July 2020. On 20 May 2020, Vicki lodged a pre-birth claim for PPL. The initial work test period for the claim is from 9 June 2019 to 5 July 2020. Vicki will not meet the work test as there is more than a 12 week continuous gap between 2 work days in the work test period.</p>

<p>Vicki indicated in the claim that Vicki was required to stop working in a dangerous job. The work test period was moved to an earlier period. Vicki's new work test period is 8 November 2018 (392 days prior to the date Vicki stopped work) to 5 December 2019.</p>

<p>Vicki provided a full job description in a statutory declaration to confirm self-employment as a professional boxer, as well as the industry regulations that state boxers are not permitted to work while pregnant.</p>

<p>Although Mandy started work with a new employer, Mandy can still meet the PPL work test under the dangerous job provision for this pregnancy.

<p>Warren's child, James was born on 1 March 2020. In July 2020, Warren lodges a claim for DAP and has nominated the DAP period to be the 2 weeks immediately following James's birth, as Warren was on unpaid leave for this period.</p>

<p>The claim indicates that Warren is not working at least 8 hours per week every week in the work test period 3 February 2019 to 1 March 2020. Warren also indicated having more than a 12 week gap between 2 consecutive work days in the work test period, but had worked for more than 330 hours. As a result, Warren was required to supply evidence to support the work test by demonstrating work history over the 13 month period.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the evidence, it is established that Warren started working for Warren’s current employer in July 2019 and was unemployed for 6 months before that. Although Warren has worked in excess of 330 hours, there is no qualifying period of 10 months in the work test period. As a result Warren does not meet the work test for DAP.</p>

<p>However, as DAP can be paid for up to 12 months after the date of birth or entry into care of a child, Warren should be advised that the work test may be met in future if another period of unpaid leave is taken and to re-test eligibility with a revised start date if this is the case.</p></td>

<p>Criteria 1</p>

<p>Customer has a complication or illness directly related to this pregnancy</p></td>
<td>

<p>The customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is experiencing a complication/illness directly related to this pregnancy, for example a low lying placenta, pelvic girdle pain etc., <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
had a complication or illness prior to their pregnancy, and this complication or illness was made worse by the pregnancy, for example the customer had lower back pain prior to becoming pregnant and this illness is now exacerbated by the pregnancy</li>
		</ul>
<p>This criteria is <strong>not</strong> met where the customer is suffering from a complication/illness not specifically related to the pregnancy such as stress and anxiety caused by caring for a sick family member or bullying in the workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> stress and anxiety related directly to the pregnancy may satisfy this criteria, for example the customer has had previous miscarriages which has caused anxiety and stress and this has resulted in the customer having to cease work or take an extended period of time off work based on medical advice.</p>

<p>Criteria 2</p>

<p>The complication or illness that was directly related to the pregnancy, prevents or prevented the person from performing their current paid work</p></td>
<td>

<p>This is met if the customer is/was prevented from performing their current paid work due to the pregnancy related illness or complication and no other job alternative can be provided by the employer, the customer does not have to be prevented from performing <strong>any</strong> paid work.</p>

<p>For example, a person may be prevented from performing their current job as a process worker in a factory and their employer is unable to provide a safe job alternative. This person would satisfy this criteria even if there was a possibility that they could work in a different job such as an office job. <strong>Note&#58; </strong>this does not include customers who are prevented from working due to a dangerous occupations such as jockeys, x-ray consultants etc. The inability to perform their current work <strong>must</strong> be as a result of the pregnancy-related complication/illness.</p>

<p>Criteria 3</p>

<p>The Service Officer is satisfied the customer would have met the work test under section 32A of the PPL act 2010, had it not been for the pregnancy-related complication or illness that prevented them from performing their current paid work</p>

<p></p></td>
<td>

<p>This requires the Service Officer to establish that the customer would have been working and would have satisfied the work test had it not been for the pregnancy related illness or complication. </p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A permanent worker who was working full time for several years before they became pregnant was required to stop working in their current job because they were suffering from pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and they needed to rest</li>
		<li>
A full time worker with a consistent work history is no longer employed due to the employer’s business closing down. Prior to losing employment, the employee was diagnosed with a pregnancy-related illness that prevented them from working. Based on the strong connection to the workforce, it is reasonable to conclude that if not for the pregnancy-related illness, they would have regained employment to satisfy the work test</li>
		<li>
A contract worker who had just ceased a contract and found out they could not commence a new contract because they had a pregnancy-related illness could also satisfy a decision maker that they would have been working or taking on new work, but for the pregnancy-related illness if they have a reasonable work history</li>
		<li>
A casual employee who works varying hours from 3-7 hours per week. As we cannot be satisfied this customer would have completed 330 hours within a qualifying period they would not meet the work test</li>		</ul>

<tr>
<td>
<a class="anchor" name="bp05_tbl_Method_used_to_test_Evidenti"></a>
<p>Evidentiary Requirements</p></td>
<td>

<p>In all cases medical evidence is required from a doctor stating what the complication is and that it is a direct result of the pregnancy or for a pre-existing condition or illness that is exacerbated as a result of this pregnancy.</p>

<p>The doctor also needs to state that the complication/illness prevents the person from performing their current paid work. If the customer does not satisfy all the above, they do not meet the requirements of 36A and do not meet the PPL Work Test.</p>
