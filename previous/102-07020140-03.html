<p>Customers in this situation will not be eligible for YA or Austudy from the day after they ceased to have an intention to study. The customer cannot satisfy their mutual obligation requirements as a jobseeker from the day they first became aware that they were not commencing the new course, or were due to commence the course, (whichever is earlier) until the date they notified. In most cases, this period will be a debt. If they wish to apply for YA (job seeker) or JobSeeker Payment (JSP), they must apply separately and meet the activity test requirements as a job seeker.</p>
