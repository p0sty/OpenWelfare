<p>Complaints are prioritised based on the customer's circumstances. A priority issue is when the customer is at risk or vulnerable or the impact on them is significant, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cognitive or neurological impairment</li>
		<li>
no income as a result of a decision and no other means of support from any source</li>
		<li>
financial hardship created by the reason for the complaint</li>

		<li>
homelessness or risk of homelessness</li>
		<li>
illness or injury requiring frequent treatment</li>
		<li>
psychiatric problems or mental illness</li>
		<li>
threats of harm to self or others</li>
		<li>
recent traumatic relationship breakdown</li>
		<li>
family and domestic violence</li>
		<li>
significant caring responsibilities</li>
		<li>
significant lack of literacy and language skills</li>
		</ul>
<p>Immediately refer the complaint to the Manager if the customer is identified as being at risk or vulnerable.</p>

<p>If prioritisation of a new complaint may impact on the timely resolution of existing complaints, advise the Manager of the priority action being taken and discuss the management of work on hand. It may be necessary for some work to be reallocated to ensure existing commitments are met.</p>

<p>Contact the customer to acknowledge the complaint. Interpersonal and conversational channels (phone, face-to-face) are more successful for complaints resolution over lean or remote communication channels (mail, email, online).</p>

<p>Complaints Officers will consider the priority and complexity of the issues when determining customer contact and the number of attempts made.</p>

<p>Make additional attempts to contact the customer if their complaint or personal circumstances are payment affecting, indicate a vulnerability, threat of harm, sensitive or priority issue. Consider a Social Worker referral and seek support from a Manager immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Customer contact requirements</strong></p>

<p>The objective of escalated complaint management is to speak with the customer. Complaints Officers are required to make a minimum of 3 genuine contact attempts to the complainant, including making&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the first contact attempt upon receipt of the complaint</li>
		<li>
further contact attempts on the day of receipt of the complaint if the customer is vulnerable or in hardship</li>
		<li>
a second contact attempt within 48 hours of receipt of the complaint</li>
		<li>
contact attempts within 5 working days if the complaint is received online, in writing or escalated via the Customer Feedback Tool</li>
		</ul>
<p>To be considered genuine contact attempts Complaints Officers are expected to make the attempts at separate times of the day. This means&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the first contact attempt is during the morning and is unsuccessful, then the second attempt should be made during the afternoon of the same day and the third on the next business day</li>
		<li>
if the first attempt is during the afternoon and is unsuccessful, the second and third attempts should be done in the morning and afternoon of the next business day</li>
		</ul>
<p>If phone contact is unsuccessful the Complaints Officer is required to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
send a 'please contact request' to the customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
providing the customer with a timeframe to respond (10 working days), and</li>
			<li>
advising the complaint will be finalised with the information at hand if the customer does not call back within the required timeframe</li>		</ul>
		<li>
attach a copy of the 'please contact request' letter to the Customer Feedback Tool entry</li>
		<li>
make another attempt to contact the customer on the due date of the 'please contact request' letter</li>
		</ul>
<p>If unable to contact the customer, Complaints Officers should take any action possible to resolve the customer's issues if it can be done without customer contact.</p>

<p>Customer aggression including violence is any actual, attempted or threatened physical or psychological harm to a person, or any actual, threatened or attempted property damage.</p>

<p>Actions are generally deliberate, unauthorised by the department, its staff or third parties, and undertaken without the consent of those affected by the actions. Customer aggression may also include a pattern of intimidating or fear inducing behaviour.</p>

<p>If it is difficult to determine the issue or how it can be resolved because the customer is demonstrating unreasonable behaviour see Customer aggression guidelines for strategies on how to manage these behaviours and progress the issue.</p>

<p>Record an investigation plan in the Customer Feedback Tool whenever a complaint cannot be resolved at first contact and requires investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the investigation plan</strong></p>

<p>Record an investigation plan whenever a complaint cannot be resolved at first contact and requires investigation. An investigation is part of the complaint record, noting research to be undertaken in managing the complaint and ensuring visibility of actions to be taken. This is especially important if the investigation cannot be completed by the officer to whom the complaint was initially assigned. The investigation plan should be reviewed and updated as required.</p>

<p><strong>What to record in an investigation plan</strong></p>

<p>The plan should include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
details of what needs to be investigated</li>
		<li>
the steps involved in the investigation</li>
		<li>
what information needs to be followed up, including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
reviewing Operational Blueprint</li>
			<li>
re-contacting the complainant</li>
			<li>
follow up with a business owner or processing team, and</li>
			<li>
reviewing previous complaints or customer records</li>		</ul>
		<li>
relevant due dates and time frames</li>
		<li>
the remedy the customer is seeking and any early conversations with customer as to whether those remedies can be achieved, or alternative remedies</li>
		<li>
