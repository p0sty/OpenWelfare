<h3>Review of change of assessment (COA) application</h3>


<p>Effective 16 December 2014, COA applications cannot be lodged on cases where the assessment has ended for the child.</p>

<p>On 1 July 2015 the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) merged with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to form the new AAT. Prior to this date SSAT had the jurisdiction to review most child support objection decisions. Reference to previous or pending AAT decisions in this procedure includes previous reviews conducted by SSAT.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp03_L3TT_Review_COA_appl"></a>
<h3>Review COA application</h3>


<p>Table 1&#58; this table describes the processes Internal Decision Makers (IDM) and Contracted Decision Makers (CDM) must follow when reviewing a COA application.</p>

<p>Check if the customer is managed by the following specialist areas as collaborative arrangements may be required. </p>

<p><strong>Parent Support Team (PST) or Solutions Gateway Team (SGT) customer</strong></p>

<p>Contact the Parent Support Team Service Officer (PSTSO) or Solutions Gateway Team Service Officer (SGTSO) to discuss any established communication arrangements as well as the status of other issues on the case that might impact on the COA application. For example, privacy breaches, compensation claims, complaints, freedom of information investigations, escalations and third party involvement. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09160000-01.html">Solutions Gateway Team</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Personalised Services customer</strong></p>

<p>Contact the Personalised Services Service Officer (PSSO) to discuss any established communication arrangements as well as the status of other issues on the case that might impact on the COA application. For example, privacy breaches, compensation claims, complaints, freedom of information investigations, escalations and third party involvement. See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-17021300-01.html">Personalised Services</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Capacity to Pay (CTP)</strong></p>

<p>While an investigation is in progress with CTP, the customer is locked to a CTP Officer. If a subsequent COA application is received from a customer while the investigation is in progress, contact the CTP Officer to discuss how to proceed, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03130000-01.html">Capacity to pay (CTP) Child Support</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other specialised business area</strong></p>

<p>Contact the Service Officer and undertake collaborative customer management to address the customer's issues. Other specialised business areas include Litigation, Non-compliance and International. For further information see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01100000-01.html#bp01_L3GT_4_Managing_multiple">Customer Management Approach (CMA) process, managing multiple issues - a collaborative approach</a>.</p>

<p>Document the agreed approach, actions, discussions and any issues that require further action in the COA Maintenance notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Customer is not locked to a specialised business area</strong></p>

<p>The applicant will be locked to the allocated IDM.</p>

<p>The respondent is locked after the IDM has had initial contact with the applicant and determined the application will proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Sensitive case indicator</strong></p>

<p>If there is a sensitive case indicator present on either the applicant or respondents record, check what this relates to and ensure that it is considered when discussing the COA with the customer.</p>

<p>IDMs and CDM Support Officers must <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010100-03.html">record the new COA application in Cuba</a>.</p>

<p>Check if the customer's case is based on a provisional notice of assessment (PNA). If so, <strong>immediately</strong> pend a modification to prevent a notional assessment from issuing. This also prevents adverse outcomes for family tax benefit (FTB) customers while COA application is being finalised.</p>

<p>IDMs <strong>must</strong> lock the customer to their own position. For more information, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-30010630-01.html">Transfer or lock a customer Cuba Process Help</a></p>

there is an Australian child support assessment in force (the application is received before the assessment ends for the child/ren on the case)</li>
		<li>
it relates solely to a period more than 18 months prior to the application and a court order grants leave to consider that period</li>
		<li>
it is not seeking a reduction from a minimum assessment, unless the payer has at least regular care, or</li>
		<li>
the assessment is not varied by a court order or agreement that limits the ability to apply for COA</li>
		<li>
it contains no obscene or offensive content, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09190000-01.html">Open exchange of information for Child Support customers</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>The COA application is complete if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it is on the COA form</li>
		<li>
a reason is identified</li>
		<li>
a case is identified</li>
		<li>
it is signed everywhere a signature is required</li>
		<li>
it contains <strong>any</strong> financial information at all in any section of the form</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>A non-parent carer does not have to provide their financial details</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic signatures</strong></p>

<p>A COA application with an electronic signature can be accepted when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the application has been submitted via their Child Support online account or Webmaster.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who are eligible for a Child Support online account must not be advised to use the Services Australia Webmaster email address. They must link their Child Support online account to myGov and use the document upload function in their online account because Webmaster is not a secure channel</li>
		<li>
the application has been completed with the applicant or respondents name being typed or handwritten in the signature box</li>

<p><strong>Suspended cases where the customers have reconciled</strong></p>

<p>The assessment is not considered ‘in force’ and a COA application cannot be made during a period when an assessment is suspended due to reconciliation, However, if the suspension ends before 6 months has passed because the customers separate again, the assessment is again ‘in force’ and a COA application can then be made.</p>

<p>Decisions that span a suspension period can be made. Any departure spanning that period could only affect days in the Child Support period where the customers have been assessed. For example, if a rate was varied, it would only apply to the relevant days before and after the suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> immediately escalate any written correspondence containing threats of harm, implied or overt to the designated Team Leader, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>Where there is evidence, or the other parent alleges there is, the information or documentation being presented may have been obtained unlawfully, do not use it in the decision making process.</p>

<p>To determine if evidence is unlawful, refer it to Change of Assessment (COA) and Part 6A Programme support Manager (PSM). </p>

<p>If the evidence is identified as having been unlawfully obtained <strong>before</strong> Open Exchange has occurred&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
return the evidence to the person who provided it with an explanation that it cannot be used in the process</li>

		<ul>		<li>
explain to both parents the information has not been used in the decision</li>
		<li>
keep a record that the information was in the Registrar’s possession, as any records we retain will need to be provided to the AAT in the event of an appeal</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Third party involvement</strong></p>

<p>Child Support legislation prohibits parties from being represented in the COA process, however, in some cases third party involvement may help determine whether a change of assessment should be made. See the <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> page for a link to Child Support Guide 2.6.5, Change of assessment process - application from payer or payee.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; a third party appointed under an administration order or who has Enduring Power of Attorney for either customer is not considered a representative, and can participate in the COA process. The order or Power of Attorney must be recorded in the Customer Representative window.</p>

<p>A third party can be present during the phone conversations in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an interpreter is requested or required&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
When a customer requests an interpreter, or if a DM thinks the customer is having difficulty understanding, arrange a telephone interpreter immediately, see <a href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-04010000-01.html">Interpreter Services</a>. <strong>Do not</strong> continue with the conversation if there is a risk of misunderstanding due to language or cultural barriers</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the customer has requested an <a href="../indigenous-australians/125-17060200-01.html">Indigenous interpreter</a>, or an <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05090000-01.html">Indigenous Service Officer (ISO)</a></li>
		<li>
they are present for the purposes of giving information (in rare occurrences)</li>
		<li>
there are special circumstances, for example, a hearing disability, illiteracy or severe mental illness on the part of either customer. In these cases, a third party may assist the customer to put forward their own case</li>
		</ul>
<p>If it is believed a third party is listening and/or coaching a customer, ask that they stop and, depending on how the customer replies, decide whether or not to continue with the call.</p>

<p><strong>Solicitor to receive correspondence</strong></p>

<p>A customer's solicitor may assist them in preparing their COA application and/or response form. A solicitor cannot represent the customer or be involved in the COA decision-making process but they can receive correspondence on the customer's behalf.</p>

<p>The customer may authorise their solicitor to receive letters or communications from the agency on their behalf. In such cases, ask the customer whether they want all correspondence to be sent to their solicitor, including all information provided by the other customer for exchange with them, or the solicitor to be notified of the final decision only.</p>

<p>A customer cannot apply for a COA if a court order or a child support agreement specifies a periodic rate of child support. The only exception is if a customer is applying for a variation to the provisional notional assessment where the existence of a child support agreement is disregarded, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-02020000-01.html">Notional assessment relating to child support agreements</a>.</p>

<p>A COA application can be considered where a court order or agreement does not specify an annual rate but varies 1 or more of the components of the formula or provides for non-periodic rates. The COA decision can only vary those components <strong>not</strong> varied by the court order or agreement.</p>

<p>The Deceased Customer Management (DCM) team manage all cases where a customer or child of the case is deceased, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01120000-01.html">Deceased Child Support customer management</a>.</p>

<p>A COA application received prior to the customer's death may still be considered if 1 of the customers is deceased and there is an executor, administrator or power of attorney in place. In this instance, seek technical support prior to deciding how to proceed with the application. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120020-04.html#bp04_L2GT_Policy">References</a> page contains a link to the Child Support Guide 2.6.1, When can the Registrar consider changing an assessment?</p>

<p>An application may be ineligible if the deceased customer did not have the opportunity to provide relevant information and there is no executor or administrator who can do so. Cuba will automatically issue a letter advising the customer or the executor/administrator that the application is ineligible.</p>

<p>A customer is unable to make a COA application if the child support assessment in relation to the child to whom the application is related has ended. Legislation only allows a customer to make a COA application when a child support assessment is in force.</p>

<p>Where there are multiple children on a case and an assessment ceases to be in force in relation to 1 child, an application cannot be made in relation to that child but can be made for the other child/ren of the case whose assessment/s has not ended.</p>

<p>Where a court has granted the Child Support Registrar leave under Section 112 to make a determination for a specified period, the Registrar is not authorised to make a determination for a particular child under Part 6A if the COA application is received after the assessment for the child has ended. The Registrar can make a determination in respect to any other child/ren for whom the assessment was in force on the day the COA application was made.</p>

<p>A customer should be advised to seek legal advice regarding their options to seek a departure order from a Court in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Terminating events</strong></p>

<p>A child support assessment will remain in force until the agency is notified of a terminating event <strong>and</strong> takes action to give effect to the terminating event by ending the assessment.</p>

<p>If there is a terminating event which will retrospectively end the assessment for a child from a date which is prior to the lodgement of the COA application, the COA application is valid if it was received on a date when the agency&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
had not been notified or become aware of the terminating event, or</li>
		<li>
had been notified or became aware of the terminating event but the decision to end the assessment had not yet been made</li>
		</ul>
<p>This includes circumstances where an objection to a previous decision is lodged prior to the COA application, and the objection decision (that results in a terminating event) is made after the COA application was received.</p>

<p>If a decision is made to change the assessment, the assessment can be amended for prior periods, if applicable, up to the date of the terminating event.</p>

<p>If the case is ineligible in CUBA select '<strong>In-No Assess</strong>' letter, <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Incomplete_or_i_Step09">go to Step 9</a></p>
