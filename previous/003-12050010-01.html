<p>Customers unable to take action to apply for and/or get child support due to fear of family and domestic violence or other circumstances (such as cultural or other complex circumstances), must be referred to a social worker. The social worker can assess their eligibility for an exemption. The assessment can be done jointly with an Indigenous Service Officer (ISO) or Multicultural Service Officer (MSO), if appropriate.</p>

<p>Social workers have 21 days to complete this assessment. The Service Officer should code a temporary exemption (MXR), at the point of first contact pending this decision.</p>

<p>A partial exemption may be granted where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer is unable to collect their full entitlement but it is not appropriate for them to transfer the responsibility of collection to Child Support, or</li>
		<li>
there is a retrospective increase to their private collect child support assessment and they&#58;</li>

are unable to collect the arrears from the payer, and</li>

the customer does not have a current child support case and is being voluntarily paid by the other parent (cash or non-cash) but they fear that taking action to seek child support will cause the other parent to react violently</li>

<p>A partial exemption enables the customer to collect whatever they can privately (or to be re-reconciled on the amount they actually received). Their rate of FTB Part A is based on the amount of child support they actually receive rather than the amount of the child support assessment.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the circumstances existed previously, it may be appropriate to backdate exemptions if a customer has not met the Maintenance Action Test (MAT). </p>

<p>Backdating an exemption may be appropriate for instalment customers and customers who lodge a Family Tax Benefit claim for a past period. </p>

<p>Grounds for backdating an exemption are established through an assessment of whether the circumstances existed before the date of claim for the entire backdated period. </p>

<p>Special circumstances do not need to be established to backdate an exemption to 1 July of the previous financial year. However, in order to backdate any further, special circumstances for backdating a maintenance action exemption must first be established.</p>

<p>Backdating an exemption for a customer who was not previously meeting the MAT may result in arrears of FTB.</p>

<p>If arrears are to be generated and the customer has an existing debt, consider whether a temporary exclusion from debt recovery is required where exceptional or unforeseen circumstances exist. </p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Customer has an active child support case</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers, who have an active child support case and are granted a full MAT exemption will need to have that case ended by Child Support. If the case is not ended, the exemption is of no benefit to the customer, as the Maintenance Income Test will continue to affect their FTB. Child Support will also continue to send letters to the other parent. If the case is Child Support collect, Child Support will continue to pursue unpaid child support. This may place the customer at risk of further violence or harm.</p>

<p>Social workers must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
discuss ending the case with the customers, and </li>
		<li>
warm transfer the customer to Child Support via the Parent Support Team</li>
		</ul>
<p>If this is not possible, social workers must email the Parent Support Team using the ‘Maintenance Exemption Notification to Child Support Program’ template. See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12050010-05.html">Resources</a> page for the template.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> make sure all contact details for the customer are correct in Customer First.</p>

<p>As the customer has been granted a full exemption, the discharge of arrears has no impact on their Family Tax Benefit entitlements. Ending a child support case is only possible for a specified date that occurs after the date the election is made.</p>

<p><strong>Shared or divided care in family and domestic violence cases</strong></p>

<p>If the care of the child/ren is shared or divided between the parties to a child support case a parent can elect to end the child support assessments for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any child/ren for whom they are assessed to receive child support from the other parent</li>
		<li>
any child/ren for whom they have 65% care (or more) even if their child support entitlement is $0</li>
		<li>
all children of the case if the assessed annual rate of child support for both parties is $0 AND the parent has an exemption due to family and domestic violence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the annual rate of child support payable is greater than $0 for either party, the carer entitled to receive child support (receiving parent) is only able to end the child support assessment for the child/ren in <strong>their</strong> care.</p>

<p>This could result in the receiving parent becoming the paying parent for the children in the other parent’s care. If ending the case might create further family and domestic violence or may result in the receiving parent becoming the paying parent, a partial exemption may be considered but only if the child support case is private collect.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if an FTB customer is or would be the paying parent, they are considered as having taken reasonable maintenance action for a child by having the children in their care taken into account in the child support case. Conversely, where a domestic violence exemption has been granted for the receiving parent and the alleged perpetrator’s care of the FTB child/ren increases, or their Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) increases and they subsequently become a potential receiving parent, the alleged perpetrator may then apply for child support and they are entitled to do so. The Level 2 Policy Helpdesk can help if policy advice is needed. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12050010-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

<p>Social workers must tell customers that a Service Officer from Child Support will need to speak to the customer before ending their case. Child Support can only end the case from a day after the customer speaks to a Service Officer and makes the election to end the assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Exception</strong></p>

<p>In some cases, 2 carers may be entitled to child support for the same child. For example, a grandparent and a parent. In these cases, a joint election to end the case is required from both carers. In the event that a joint election cannot be obtained from both carers and there is family violence involved, it may be appropriate to discuss a partial exemption for the parent carer as an alternative option to ending the case.</p>

<p class="info-box warning">There is no Maintenance Action Test requirement in respect of a non-parent carer and an exemption is therefore not required for them. The Level 2 Policy Helpdesk can help if policy advice is needed. See the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12050010-05.html">Resources</a> page for a link.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Backdating exemptions when a customer has an active child support case</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If the customer has an active child support case and is granted a full exemption, the customer can elect to end their child support case. If the customer does not elect to end their child support case, the exemption will not have any effect.</p>

<p>The start date of the exemption has no impact on the date the child support case is ended. The earliest date Child Support can end the case is from the day after they speak to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> social worker has an appointment with the customer 22/09/20 and backdates a full exemption to 01/07/19 due to violence. The customer is unable to speak to Child Support to end their case on 22/09/20. The social worker sends through a referral to Child Support to contact the customer to discuss ending their case. Child Support successfully contact the customer on 01/10/20 and the customer confirms they want to end their case. Child Support end the case from the date of contact with the customer, which was 01/10/20. </p>

<p>As part of the election to end, the customer may choose to discharge any child support arrears owing. This has no impact on the MIT.</p>

		<li>
determine if the exemption from taking child support action due to fear of family and domestic violence is still appropriate</li>
