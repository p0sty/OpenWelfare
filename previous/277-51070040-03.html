		<ul>		<li>
the parents are exempt from the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) because it would be unreasonable for them to obtain child support from the surrogate. An in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) exemption should be applied</li>

where only 1 parent is named on the Birth Certificate, that is, 1 parent is named and the other is recorded as 'surrogate', the IVF exemption should also be applied</li>
		<li>
if an individual had a partner at the time they first claimed FTB for a child born under a surrogacy arrangement and the individual's relationship with the partner ends, the individual is not required to obtain child support from the partner. This is because, under child support legislation, child support can only be sought from a legal parent of the child and neither the individual nor their former partner is the child's legal parent without a recognised court order</li>

<p>Section 60HB of the Family Law Act states that if a court has made an order under a prescribed law of a state or territory to the effect that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a child is the child of 1 or more persons, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
each of 1 or more persons is a parent of a child</li>
		</ul>
<p>Then, for the purposes of that Act, the child is the child of each of those persons.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the Maintenance Action Test (MAT), the parent/s of a child born under a surrogacy arrangement are recognised where parentage has been transferred by a court order under a prescribed State/Territory law.</p>

<p><strong>Member of a couple</strong></p>

<p>The parent(s) of the child are those people listed in the court order, for example, the customer and their partner.</p>

<p>In the circumstance where the parents (as listed in the court order) separate they are not exempt from the MAT (as distinct from surrogacy cases not recognised under the Family Law Act outlined above). As a result, the FTB customer is required to take reasonable action to obtain child support from the child's other parent. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Single customer</strong></p>

<p>Where a child has entered the care of a single person via a surrogacy arrangement and that individual is listed in the court order as the sole parent of the child, the in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) MAT exemption should be applied. This is because in this circumstance there is no other legal parent of the child.</p>

<p>A Service Officer can generally determine if the customer needs to obtain child support to satisfy the Maintenance Action Test (MAT).</p>

<p>Some cases may need to be referred to a Social Worker for assessment of a MAT exemption (other than 'parentage unknown'). For example, customer at risk of violence or a harmful or disruptive effect may occur if Child Support investigations were to commence (such as attempting to contact the sperm donor). Consider the following scenarios in determining whether the customer is required to meet the requirements of the MAT for the child, or whether a parentage unknown exemption is appropriate&#58;</p>

<p>Where the ACP was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
administered through a medical clinic or medical professional (mother was a member of a couple at the time the child was conceived and the partner consented to the procedure). See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070040-05.html">Scenario 1 in the Applying the MAT in ACP cases</a> table on the Resources page.
