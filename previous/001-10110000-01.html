<p>CDP job seekers in receipt of a participation payment are required to comply with mutual obligation requirements as a condition of their payment.</p>

<p>When a CDP job seeker repeatedly fails to comply with requirements, a more serious penalty may apply. Serious failures for persistent non-compliance are intended to act as a deterrent for patterns of behaviour that result in a CDP job seeker not making the most of their opportunities to find work.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>A serious failure is applied when the CDP job seeker's non-compliance over the Serious Failure assessment period has been determined as 'persistent'. This involves the decision maker considering both the pattern of non-compliance and the appropriateness of the CDP job seeker's mutual obligation requirements. When there are 3 applied failures over the Serious Failure assessment period, and the CDP job seeker's requirements were assessed as appropriate according to their capacity and any other relevant circumstances, the non-compliance will generally be deemed 'persistent' and a serious failure will be applied.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Comprehensive_C">Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Before making a determination on a serious failure for persistent non-compliance, a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA) must be undertaken by a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-CCA Specialist.</p>

<p>After a CCA has been conducted, a PST-skilled Service Officer with a WNPPD security resource is responsible for making a determination whether or not to apply a serious failure as a result of persistent non-compliance.</p>

<p>While a pattern of repeated non-compliance may indicate persistent non-compliance, it may also be an indication&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the CDP job seeker may be having difficulty complying with their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
the requirements may be unreasonable and/or unrealistic given the CDP job seeker's current circumstances</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker may have significant barriers to participation which were not previously disclosed or the potential impact of previously identified circumstances may have not been understood and/or considered</li>
		</ul>
<p>The CCA ensures a CDP job seeker's personal factors and/or circumstances that affected their capacity to comply are appropriately considered before making the decision to apply a serious failure</p>

<p><a href="../job-seekers/001-18030213-01.html">The CCA Report</a> forms part of the evidence base used by a PST-skilled Service Officer (WNPPD) to determine if the CDP job seeker has demonstrated persistent non-compliance. Information on the CDP job seeker's record, including previous failure investigations and information provided by the CDP job seeker's provider, also forms part of the evidence for this decision.</p>

<p>When considering whether the CDP job seeker's non-compliance was persistent, consideration must be given to whether the CDP job seeker has displayed a pattern of sustained non-compliance that was intentional, reckless or negligent in nature throughout the CCA assessment period.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An assessment of 'persistent' non-compliance should take into consideration&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the CDP job seeker's overall compliance record over the period that is, all non-compliance should be considered including valid Non-Attendance Reports (NARs) submitted with or without a Participation Appointment Report (PAR)</li>
		<li>
whether the overall compliance record demonstrates a pattern of persistent non-compliance</li>
		<li>
the extent to which the CDP job seeker has otherwise complied with their requirements during the assessment period</li>
		<li>
only applied failures or non-compliance events that were within the CDP job seeker's control, that is, the delegate is satisfied the failures or events were committed intentionally, recklessly and negligently</li>
		<li>
only failures or non-compliance events when the CDP job seeker's mutual obligation requirements are reasonable and the appropriate notification has been given, and</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker's most recent compliance history which may serve to demonstrate a genuine willingness to change earlier behaviours</li>
		</ul>
<p>The term 'persistent' has its ordinary meaning that is, persistence would be indicated by deliberate and continued non-compliance despite repeated warnings from their CDP Provider and/or the Participation Solutions Team (PST). This does not mean the non-compliance needs to be total&#58; a CDP job seeker may be found to be persistently non-compliant even though they have met some of their mutual obligation requirements over the period, however&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if the CDP job seeker's record indicates they are genuine in their efforts to find work, despite instances of non-compliance, the decision maker may find the pattern of non-compliance was not persistent</li>
		<li>
when consecutive failures have triggered a CCA, this may not always provide sufficient evidence of persistent non-compliance, for example, if it was the CDP job seeker's first CCA and it was clear there had been no opportunity for reinforcing obligations and potential consequences of repeated non-compliance with the CDP job seeker before the CCA was triggered</li>
