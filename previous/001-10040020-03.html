<p>Providers are responsible for notifying and managing reconnection requirements when a mutual obligation failure or work refusal failure has been committed and notifying Services Australia when the conditions have been met to lift a participation suspension.</p>

<p>Job seekers affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency who have an outstanding participation suspension are required to contact their provider as soon as possible to discuss any impacts on their capacity to comply. When contact with the provider occurs, providers may decide a reconnection requirement will not be notified/needed due to the circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the job seeker is due to report but is unable to contact their provider because of impacts affecting the provider site, the job seeker should be referred to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) for assistance.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>Generally, the Capability Assessment should be completed at the time of initial contact. Any impacts the natural disaster or declared emergency are likely to have on the job seeker's capacity to meet their current requirements on an ongoing basis should be considered and recorded during the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>When the job seeker is due to report and it is not possible or appropriate to complete the Capability Assessment due to the natural disaster or declared emergency, the PST staff may ask the job seeker to call back as soon as possible before or on the their next reporting day to complete the assessment.</p>

<p>In these cases&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker has met the reconnection requirement to arrange a Capability Assessment once the purpose of the Capability Assessment has been explained and privacy provisions have been read. On the <strong>Capability Assessment</strong> screen, PST staff must select <strong>Can't conduct assessment today</strong> and record the appropriate reason to <strong>Save and Exit</strong> the workflow</li>
		<li>
the job seeker will then be able to finalise their current reporting, however, a contact trigger will prevent further reporting/payment until the Capability Assessment is completed</li>
		</ul>

<p>The impact of the natural disaster or declared emergency on the job seeker's capacity to comply, including capacity to make prior contact, should be considered as part of a compliance investigation.</p>

<p>If a job seeker was unable to comply with a requirement because of a natural disaster or declared emergency, their verbal statement provides the required level of evidence to make a determination of reasonable excuse. The impact of the disaster/emergency is also likely to have affected the job seeker's ability to contact prior to an appointment.</p>

<p>When the failure event date was before the disaster/emergency and the job seeker has been personally affected by the disaster/emergency, consideration should be given to the impacts of applying the failure given the job seeker's current circumstances. In these cases, discretion may be used to reject the failure.</p>

<p>Rejecting a failure because of a disaster/emergency&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a decision is made to reject a failure because of a disaster/emergency, the rejection code <strong>ERB</strong> - Disastrous event or severe weather conditions - unable to comply, should be recorded</li>
		<li>
When a decision is made to reject a failure that occurred before the disaster/emergency, record free text information to advise the provider the failure was rejected because the job seeker was personally affected by the disaster/emergency. Identify that the short-term benefits of applying the failure would not have long-term benefits in terms of future compliance, and would be considered detrimental in the circumstances</li>

<p>Generally, the unemployment failure or work refusal failure should be completed at the time of initial contact.</p>

<p>If an employer cannot be contacted because of the disaster/emergency, evidence provided by the job seeker along with the Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) or participation report needs to be carefully considered.</p>

<p>When information from the job seeker conflicts with the information recorded on an SU1, the job seeker's statement should provide enough information to make a determination on the Unemployment Failure.</p>

<p>Voluntary unemployment has not occurred if a job seeker left work because they are no longer being paid by their employer because of the disaster/emergency.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-03010010-01.html">Unemployed eligibility for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (job seeker)</a>.</p>

<p>When the job seeker is due to report and it is not possible or appropriate to complete the unemployment failure or work refusal failure due to the natural disaster or declared emergency, Services Australia may temporarily lift the contact trigger allowing the job seeker to report&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow, the <strong>Save and Exit</strong> option <strong>Unable to complete on day of contact</strong> must be used to record the reason the compliance investigation cannot be completed</li>
		<li>
Once <strong>Continue</strong> has been selected this save and exit reason will temporarily remove the contact trigger on the day of contact only, and will reinstate the trigger the next day</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the job seeker is not due to report, and it is not possible or appropriate to complete the unemployment failure or work refusal failure, the contact trigger does not need to be temporarily removed. Tell the job seeker to call back as soon as possible before or on their reporting day to discuss the non-compliance.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>When payment is cancelled due to persistent mutual obligation failures, an unemployment failure or work refusal failure, a post-cancellation preclusion period prevents job seekers who reclaim from immediately returning to payment. When an unemployment failure occurred before claim, the new claim start date is affected by an unemployment preclusion period.</p>

<p>Advise the job seeker of their appeal rights. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10130000-01.html">Non-compliance with compulsory requirements - review and appeals</a>.</p>

<p>If the job seeker requests assistance due to hardship, often the most appropriate action is to <a target="_blank" href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-11040000-03.html">refer the customer to a welfare agency</a>.</p>

<p>The assessment of outstanding failures for CDP participants who are personally affected by or are assisting with the recovery effort through a registered organisation should be given priority. This includes CDP participants who have a contact trigger or an <a href="../job-seekers/001-10080000-01.html">automatic payment suspension (participation suspension (APA))</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Participation suspensions</strong></p>

<p>PST staff are responsible for lifting a participation suspension (APA) for CDP participants affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency once contact is established and they agree to re-engage. When PST staff determine re-engagement is not possible or appropriate, payment can be restored.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10090050-01.html">Finalising Community Development Program (CDP) re-engagement requirements</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Failure investigations</strong></p>

The impact of the disaster/emergency is also likely to have affected the CDP participant's ability to contact prior to an appointment or activity.</p>

<p>When the failure event date was before the disaster/emergency and the CDP participant has been personally affected by the disaster/emergency, consideration should be given to the impacts of applying the failure given their current circumstances. In these cases, discretion may be used to reject the failure.</p>

<p>When a decision is made to reject a failure, and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the reason is a disaster/emergency&#58;</li>

<p>CDP participants who contact Services Australia and advise they are affected by a disaster/emergency, but have an outstanding <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030213-01.html">Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)</a>, should have the CCA completed by a CCA Specialist where possible.</p>

<p>Where the CDP participant is unable to participate in the CCA due to the disaster or emergency, the CCA Specialist may complete the CCA using information already available on the CDP participant's record. Interventions should include crisis intervention and non-vocational assistance to assist with disaster recovery where appropriate.</p>

<p>Where a CCA was unable to be completed because there is insufficient information already available on the CDP participant's record to do so, PST staff should record that the CCA was not fully undertaken due to the CDP participant being directly impacted by the emergency or disaster and use the 'Nationally declared disaster' rejection reason. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040090-01.html">Rejecting a compliance action</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver options</strong></p>

<p>When the failure has been applied and a waiver re-engagement appointment cannot be booked within 2 working days due to the disaster/emergency (for example, provider closed), consideration should be given to booking a waiver re-engagement appointment at the first suitable time. If a suitable appointment is not available within 28 days, the serious failure period should be permanently waived. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040090-01.html">Waiving a serious failure period</a>.</p>

<p>When the failure has been applied and the CDP participant advises they have been personally affected by a disaster/emergency, they may be eligible for payment under serious failure hardship provisions if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they indicate their willingness to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment, but because of the disaster/emergency, they do not have capacity to do so, and</li>
		<li>
serving the serious failure period would cause the CDP participant to be in severe financial hardship. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120070-01.html">Serious failure hardship provisions</a></li>		</ul>

<p>If a CDP participant refuses to accept or fails to commence a suitable job offer due to a disaster/emergency, reasonable excuse provisions will apply. The CDP participant's statement about how the disaster/emergency affected their ability to accept or commence the job should provide enough information to make a determination unless there is reason to doubt their statement. When reasonable excuse is established, the serious failure should be rejected.</p>

<p>When the serious failure event occurred prior to the disaster/emergency, a serious failure will need to be investigated. However, in cases where when a CDP participant has been personally affected by the disaster/emergency, consideration should be given to the impacts of applying the failure given their current circumstances. In these cases, discretion may be used to reject the failure using the rejection reason code <strong>NDE</strong> - Naturally declared disaster.</p>

<p>Any outstanding UNPP investigations that occurred before or during an emergency must be investigated.</p>

<p>Generally, the UNPP should be completed at the time of initial contact. When the CDP participant is due to report and it is not possible or appropriate to complete the UNPP due to the natural disaster or declared emergency, Services Australia may temporarily lift the contact trigger allowing the CDP participant to report&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow, the <strong>Save and Exit</strong> option <strong>Unable to complete on day of contact</strong> must be used to record the reason the compliance investigation cannot be completed</li>

<p>Voluntary unemployment has not occurred if a CDP participant left work because they are no longer being paid by their employer because of the disaster/emergency. For more information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-03010010-01.html">Unemployed eligibility for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (job seeker)</a>.</p>

<p>If an employer cannot be contacted because of the disaster/emergency, evidence provided by the CDP participant along with the Employment Separation Certificate (SU1) or participation report needs to be carefully considered. When information from the CDP participant conflicts with the information recorded on the SU1, the CDP participant's statement should provide enough information to make a determination on the UNPP.</p>

<p>When a decision is made to apply a UNPP, the CDP participant's eligibility to have the UNPP ended under the hardship provisions should be assessed.</p>

<p>An appropriate level of discretion should be applied when determining whether a CDP participant is eligible for payment under <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060040-01.html">hardship provisions</a> during a UNPP and has been impacted by a disaster or emergency. For example, when a CDP participant&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
 is unable to provide evidence or advises that they are homeless because of the disaster/emergency, their statement should be considered appropriate evidence, unless there is reason to doubt the statement</li>
		<li>
may be unable to provide current financial information, the Services Australia record should be used unless disputed by the CDP participant</li>
		<li>
advises that, because of the disaster/emergency, they have used a significant amount of their savings and investments, this expenditure should be considered to have been unavoidable or reasonable</li>
		</ul>
<p>Unless otherwise advised for a specific natural disaster, payment is reinstated under hardship provisions for CDP participants personally affected by a disaster/emergency from the date all the following are satisfied&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the CDP participant asks to have the UNPP ended under hardship provisions</li>
		<li>
the CDP participant is a vulnerable CDP participant who falls within a class of person specified by the Secretary of DEWR, and</li>
		<li>
the CDP participant would be in severe financial hardship because of the UNPP</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is not appropriate to back date hardship provisions before the CDP participant meets all the above criteria.</p>

<p>Where a CDP participant does not meet the criteria for payment under hardship provisions, and is currently serving or yet to commence a UNPP, payment may be continued under <a href="../job-seekers/001-10130010-01.html">Payment Pending Review (PPR)</a> provisions.
