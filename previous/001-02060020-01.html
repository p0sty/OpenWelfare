<p>Providers are listed in the Online Diary according to their earliest available sessions. The list can be searched by postcode, provider name and, for some providers, service centre or area of expertise.</p>

<p>When making the referral to Workforce Australia, Service Officers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>must</strong> advise the job seeker of available providers in their local area</li>

<strong>should</strong> advise the job seeker that provider performance ratings are available to view, if interested, to inform their selection.

<strong>must not</strong> provide advice to job seekers about which provider to choose</li>
		</ul>
<p>For some providers, preferences and exclusions can be keyed to sort the list of providers. If providers are 'full', 'closed' or 'not available' they <strong>cannot</strong> be selected.</p>

<p>Services Australia does not have the functionality to change a provider for a job seeker once the initial appointment has been booked. Service Officers can contact the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations&#58;</p>

Employment Services Helpdesk, to <strong>correct</strong> a referral made to the <strong>wrong</strong> provider, or</li>

		<li>
until they reach the maximum time they are allowed with one Workforce Australia provider, or</li>

until the Workforce Australia organisation no longer has a contract</li>

<p>Job seekers referred to Workforce Australia Online will remain with the online service until DEWR deem it appropriate to refer them to a Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>Maximum time transfers ensure job seekers who have been with the same provider for an extended period without achieving an employment outcome are transferred to a new provider. This will give job seekers different servicing which may improve their prospects of getting a job.</p>

<p>Services Australia has no role in the maximum time transfer process as this is calculated by the DEWR system. Job seekers with questions about the transfer process should contact the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.</p>

<p>The Online Diary has the facility for appointments to be made up to 6 weeks into the future for Workforce Australia and CDP providers. However, job seekers are required to have appointments as soon as possible, preferably within 2 working days of the Participation Interview being conducted.</p>

<p>Job seekers who are subject to <a href="../job-seekers/001-02030000-01.html">RapidConnect</a> provisions <strong>and</strong> are not referred to Workforce Australia Online, are required to have an appointment with a provider within 2 working days of&#58;</p>

		<li>
being advised of their obligation to attend a RapidConnect appointment</li>

<p>If an appointment is not available within 2 days, an appointment within the next 14 calendar days may be selected. Contact with the provider should be made in order to seek an appropriate appointment. However, if additional provider sessions are not able to be arranged with any providers in the job seeker's local area within 14 calendar days, the job seeker will be exempt from RapidConnect requirements.

<p>Where a job seeker re-registers within the allowable break (13 weeks) and was previously connected to a Workforce Australia, TtW or CDP provider, they will be reconnected to the same provider. There is no requirement for the Service Officer to book the initial appointment for the job seeker in this instance and they would be exempt from RapidConnect.</p>

<p>Job seekers in CDP regions will be re-registered with the CDP provider for that region. If the job seeker has moved to a non CDP region, they will be able to select a Workforce Australia provider of their choice.</p>

<p>Services Australia, Workforce Australia, TtW and CDP providers can reschedule the RapidConnect or initial appointment with the job seeker as long as the appointment is still in the future and no result has previously been recorded for that appointment. 'Created in Error' can be input for DES Referrals, which will cancel the whole referral.</p>

<p>When the appointment is rescheduled, Service Officers need to ensure that the job seeker is advised about their appointment details verbally or in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Special considerations for RapidConnect appointments</strong></p>

<p>If a job seeker is subject to the RapidConnect provisions, rescheduling their RapidConnect appointment may affect their income support payment. Service Officers are required to determine whether a request to reschedule a RapidConnect appointment is for an acceptable reason and the new appointment must be booked within 14 days from the date the <strong>Online Participation Workflow</strong> was run.</p>

<p>Where the RapidConnect appointment date has passed or an appointment result has already been keyed, the RapidConnect appointment can no longer be rescheduled, and the appointment will need to be rebooked.</p>

<p>If the provider has not re-booked the initial RapidConnect appointment and the job seeker either attends or contacts Services Australia, the Service Officer can rebook the appointment using the Online Participation Workflow if the original claim was completed online.
