<p>Tell the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Today we will be talking about the ParentsNext program</li>
		<li>
Due to your current circumstances they can choose to take part in ParentsNext as a voluntary participant</li>
		<li>
This means that you do not need to participate in the program. However, you can still choose to volunteer</li>
		<li>
ParentsNext is available to anyone who receives Parenting Payment with a child under six</li>
		<li>
You don't have to look for work as part of the ParentsNext program. It's a program to help you prepare for getting a job when your youngest child goes to school - or sooner if that is what you want. Your ParentsNext provider can help you to think about your future and what you hope to achieve</li>
		<li>
Your ParentsNext provider can help you set your future goals and work with you to reach them</li>
		<li>
ParentsNext supports parents and carers in lots of different ways. Some examples of support available are&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
help finding a training course or work if you are ready</li>
			<li>
putting you in touch with other parents and carers</li>
			<li>
connecting you with local services such as counselling, financial advice, health, housing and domestic and family violence support</li>
			<li>
financial support to help with the cost of starting work or study, such as paying for a course or laptop, or buying clothes for work</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Although you do not need to look for work, your provider will help with work readiness skills - like writing resumes and job interview practice</li>
		<li>
Support you to identify and work towards your education and employment goals</li>
		<li>
Have access to financial help through the Participation Fund, a flexible pool of funds that can be used to cover costs associated with work or study, such as the cost of training courses, child care, transport, IT equipment and job appropriate clothing</li>
		</ul>
<p>Tell the customer that they can find more information about the program and read stories from participants at the <a class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.dewr.gov.au/parentsnext">ParentsNext website</a>.</p>

<p>Does the customer want to volunteer?</p>

		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, tell the customer if they change their mind about being a ParentsNext volunteer, they can either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
contact Services Australia, or</li>
			<li>
talk to a ParentsNext provider to check if they are eligible to participate in the program<br>To find a ParentsNext provider, go to <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.workforceaustralia.gov.au/individuals/coaching/providers/search?providerType=PNE5">Workforce Australia's website</a>.

		<li>
Launch the Volunteer GP from the Volunteer button under the Volunteer section of the page and ask the customer the eligibility questions</li>
		<li>
Select the relevant radio button based on the customer's responses to each question</li>
		<li>
Does the customer wish to volunteer? This will automatically default to 'No' if the customer's responses result in them being ineligible, otherwise select 'Yes'</li>
		<li>
Comments field, record relevant notes based on whether the customer was eligible to volunteer or not</li>

Go to the <strong>Review</strong> screen and finalise the GP</li>

<p>The following key messages must be communicated during the appointment. Advise the customer of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Today we will be talking about the voluntary ParentsNext program</li>
		<li>
ParentsNext is available to anyone who receives Parenting Payment with a child under six</li>
		<li>
It's a program to help you prepare for getting a job when your youngest child goes to school - or sooner if that is what you want. Your ParentsNext provider can help you to think about your future and what you hope to achieve</li>
		<li>
Your ParentsNext provider can help you set your future goals and work with you to reach them</li>
		<li>
ParentsNext supports parents and carers in lots of different ways. Some examples of support available are&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
financial support to help with the cost of starting work or study, such as paying for a course or laptop, or buying clothes for work</li>
			<li>
help finding a training course or work if you are ready</li>
			<li>
putting you in touch with other parents and carers</li>
			<li>
connecting you with local services such as counselling, financial advice, health, housing and domestic and family violence support</li>
			<li>
although you do not need to look for work, help with work readiness skills - like writing resumes and job interview practice</li>		</ul>
		<li>
We will make an appointment with a ParentsNext Provider who will talk to you more about the program</li>
		<li>
While you are being referred to a provider, you do not need to take part in the program if it is not right for you and your Parenting Payment won’t be affected if you choose not to take part</li>
		<li>
At your appointment your provider will give you more information about the program and available support</li>
		<li>
You can tell your provider if you choose not to participate</li>
		<li>
Your Parenting Payment won't be affected if they choose not to take part. The program is voluntary</li>
		<li>
More information on ParentsNext is in the Welcome To ParentsNext Brochure</li>
		</ul>
<p>Ensure you have access to the ParentsNext brochure.</p>
