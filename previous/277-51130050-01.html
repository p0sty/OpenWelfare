<p>If the couple separate again within 6 months, the payee will have the previous child support assessment reinstated without having to make a new application. The child support assessment only comes back into force from the date the parents re-separate.</p>

<p>If the customer remains reconciled with the other parent for 6 months, Child Support will end the child support case once they confirm with the customer that they are still partnered. Details of the end case will be sent to Centrelink so that the customer's record is automatically updated. If the couple separate after the case has ended, the customer is required to reapply for child support.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When a child/case end is transferred from Child Support for a Child Support Collect customer on the Disbursement method, the system retrospectively changes the case to Private Collect and applies the full maintenance entitlement amount.</p>

<p>This retrospective change in assessment results in the customer having their annualised maintenance income assessed under the Entitlement Method. In the majority of cases, this will result in a decrease in the customer's ongoing rate of FTB Part A. This change in annualised maintenance income can also invoke Mandatory Continuous Adjustment, causing a further reduction to the customer's ongoing rate of FTB.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is not caused by incorrectly entered/ended case data or a system problem, however it can lead to an unintended and unexpected reduction to the customer's ongoing rate. Occurrences of this issue must be reported to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for escalation to the Policy (Advice) Assessment Team for a workaround to be considered.
