<p>It is critical that the insolvency agent understands that child support debts rank highly when determining which creditors to pay. The insolvency agent must be made aware that the agency is a priority creditor under child support legislation (for child support deductions, not for penalties, costs or fines). The following sections explain the level of priority for different types of child support debts&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>EW amounts deducted but not remitted to the agency&#58;</strong> debts arising from EW payments deducted but not yet remitted are priority debts in accordance with section 50 of the Child Support (Registration &amp; Collection) Act 1988. Subsection 50(2) states that an amount payable under subsection 50(1) has priority over all other debts, whether preferential, secured or unsecured</li>
		<li>
<strong>s72A payments deducted but not remitted&#58; </strong>where Child Support become aware that an employer has made deductions under a s72A notice but not remitted the funds. For example, if it is apparent that an offence may have been committed, <a href="../separated-parents/277-04190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Report_Suspecte">report the suspected Welfare, Health and Child Support fraud</a> so that the Intelligence and Investigations Branch can decide if there are sufficient grounds for prosecution</li>
		<li>
<strong>amounts not yet deducted&#58; </strong>these amounts are not yet owed, but are payments of wages owed to the payer. A payer must lodge a claim for these amounts directly with the insolvency agent. Where the payer’s claim is successful and payment of unpaid wages are subsequently made to the paying parent the insolvency agent becomes bound by any Child Support notices (s72A or s45) in place and should forward payment to Services Australia in compliance with those notices. Take steps to notify the insolvency agent of their obligations should it become aware of this possibility</li>
		<li>
<strong>court ordered garnishees (s72A notices)</strong>&#58; if the liquidator states there is a court ordered garnishee which will take priority over Child Support notices (s45/s72A), advise the liquidator that notices issued by the Registrar have priority over the court order. An s45 notice is a statutory garnishee notice issued under Commonwealth legislation. The order in which the notices were received does not matter</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the employer has deducted amounts in accordance with an employer withholding notice, payment of those amounts to the Register ought to be prioritised ahead of all other debts (this includes unpaid PAYG tax, wages and superannuation entitlements). The exceptions to this being where there are amounts payable under the former subsection 221YHZD(3) Income Tax Assessment Act (1936) and any costs, charges or expenses of the administration of the estate or of the winding up of the company (subsection 50(3) of the Registration and Collection Act). </p>

<p>To represent Services Australia’s interests, a Proof of Debt notice (POD) <strong>must</strong> be issued even if the insolvency agent does not request it. Inform the insolvency agent that the agency is a priority creditor (for child support deductions, not for penalties, costs or fines), as they may advise there are no funds available but there may be funds to pay priority creditors. </p>

<p>Before issuing a POD, reconcile the employer’s account to ensure there is no excess or unallocated cash. Investigate and resolve any issues.</p>

<p>The POD provides a breakdown of the employer’s child support debt at the date of liquidation which will include unremitted child support.</p>

<p>Issue an approved <a target="_blank">Liquidation Proof of Debt</a> (including covering letter), even if the insolvency agent provides a generic POD form. Do <strong>not</strong> use the notice currently available in Cuba. The POD letter must contain the Chief Operating Officer’s signature block but no actual signature. The ESO does not need to include their details or signature on the letter. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Cuba Letters Process Help</a>.</p>

<p>Include the following with the POD letter&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attach an <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-04190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Services_Austra">Advice of a likely payment of debt form (CS4456)</a>.<strong> Note</strong>&#58; before printing, complete questions 1 to 3 and include the Payment Reference Number </li>
		<li>
include any deduction schedules which were in place at the time of the liquidation</li>
		<li>
a copy of any s72A notices in force at the time that were not fully complied with</li>
		</ul>
<p>Record the POD notice in the liquidator’s organisation’s Communication window and batch file a copy&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
upload to the employer’s correspondence window, using the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Macros">Document Upload Request macro</a>. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-01030000-01.html">Documenting Child Support information</a></li>

<p>If a payer is linked to an insolvent employer, their employment may be terminated or their income reduced.</p>

<p>Upon receiving a PP EW EMPLOYER LIQUIDATION intray from an ESO, Service Officers can contact the payer to provide options for managing their ongoing child support obligations as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they may need to make manual child support payments</li>
		<li>
their payment arrangement may need to change</li>
		<li>
they may need to estimate their income</li>
		<li>
liquidation of the employer does not mean their arrears will be discharged</li>
		<li>
maintenance and penalties continue to accrue after the liquidation date</li>
		<li>
Services Australia will continue to actively collect all amounts owing</li>
		<li>
the payer should notify Child Support if their employment situation changes, and</li>
		<li>
any unpaid deductions still need to be paid, except EW that has been deducted but not remitted</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is concerned that the employer has not reported deductions to Child Support (not all deductions have been applied to their account) they should provide deduction evidence (such as payslips) so this can be investigated, top up applied and a POD issued by ESO.</p>

<p>The owning Service Officer must also contact the payee if their child support payments will be affected by any change to the payer’s employment conditions. Advise the payee that the payer’s circumstances have changed, but do not discuss any specific circumstances regarding loss of employment or reduction in hours.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; some information on liquidations is publicly available through sources such as public notices in newspapers or the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04190000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_websit">Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)</a> website. Do not disclose specific information about the payer’s employment to the payee.</p>
