<div class="showcont">


<p>Distribution amounts can be determined by examining the private trust's distribution or private company's dividend statement.</p>

<p>Distribution amounts paid to an attributable stakeholder can be disregarded include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
amounts already been included as attribution income</li>
		<li>
amounts from prior year profits</li>
		</ul>
<p>The gifting provisions in relation to distributions paid to a non-attributable stakeholder will be disregarded if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer can show they were not in receipt of an income support payment and could not have reasonably known they would require income support at the time the distribution or dividend was paid, or</li>
		<li>
the non-attributable stakeholder has been assessed as a Genuine Investor and the distribution paid to the Genuine Investor is commensurate with their investment in the entity, or </li>
		<li>
the distribution has been paid in lieu of wages </li>
		</ul>
<p>For the non-controller the distribution will be assessed as income for 52 weeks, unless it is determined the distribution was either paid periodically or in lieu of wages.</p>

<p>Where the customer is advising the distribution has been paid periodically, refer these cases to the <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//intranet.internal.dept.local/Pages/customer/submit-enquiry.html">Level 2 Policy Helpdesk</a>.</p>

<p>Where the distribution has not been paid periodically and will be assessed as income for 52 weeks, set a review to update the Trust/Company Distribution (<strong>TRD)</strong> screen 52 weeks after the distribution. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-05.html">Resources</a> for an example.</p>

<p>Where a controller ceases involvement with the entity, any distribution (excluding final distribution) received prior to severing ties, is assessed for 52 weeks. Set up a review to update the <strong>TRD</strong> screen 52 weeks after the distribution. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-05.html">Resources</a> for an example.</p>

<p><strong>Family Domestic Violence (FDV)</strong></p>

<p>There are special provisions for customers affected by Family Domestic Violence (FDV) and where previous trust or company distributions affect, or will affect, their rate of income support payment (ISP) or entitlement to Low Income Card (LIC).</p>

<p>If the customer disclosed, or there is evidence the customer may be, or has been, experiencing FDV (including FDV in child/parent relationships) <strong>and</strong> a previous trust or company distribution will/is affecting the rate of their ISP payment or entitlement to LIC?</p>

<p>Is there evidence or information provided by the customer that indicates they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are a non-attributable stakeholder or a private trust or private company, and</li>
		<li>
a previous private trust or company distribution will/is affecting their rate of ISP payment or entitlement to LIC, and</li>
		<li>
do not have access to, or benefit in any way, from any distributed funds due to FDV, and</li>
		<li>
has separated or contact has ended with the perpetrator of violence, such as the family members are no longer living together or a child was affected by FDV. (The customer is not required to be previously partnered to the perpetrator of the FDV to seek an exemption)</li>

<p>Go to the Trust/Company Distribution (<strong>TRD</strong>) screen and code the following fields&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Event Date&#58;</strong> record the date of the resolution to distribute</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the resolution to distribute states a percentage and not a specific amount, the beneficiary's legal entitlement to a distribution only commences from the date the amount is known. This is usually when the tax return is completed. The date the amount is known is the date of event</li>
			<li>
if the resolution declares to distribute a specific amount for a beneficiary but the trust tax return has not been lodged at the time of the resolution, the date of event is the date the resolution was made, not the date the tax return was lodged</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Amount&#58;</strong> record the amount of the distribution in whole dollars<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if distributions have not ceased, but no distribution has been paid for a particular financial year, $0 should be recorded in order to ensure a review is triggered correctly for the following financial year's returns and financial statements</li>
		<li>
<strong>CRN&#58;</strong> Code the Customer Reference Number (CRN). The distribution amount will pass through to that customer's record and display on the Trust/Company Income/ Assets Details (<strong>TRCIAS</strong>) screen in the customers record. If the customer is also a controller of the trust/company only the distribution amount in excess of their attributed income will be treated as distribution income<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the distribution is made to a child and that child has a CRN because their parent may be receiving family assistance, do not record the child's CRN</li>
		<li>
<strong>Gen INV&#58;</strong> or <strong>Deprivation&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the distribution was made to a genuine investor, code '<strong>GNI</strong>'</li>
			<li>
If the distribution was made during the 1999/2000 year, code '<strong>CON</strong>'</li>
			<li>
If either '<strong>GNI</strong>' or '<strong>CON</strong>' have been recorded in the <strong>Gen INV&#58;</strong> or <strong>Deprivation&#58;</strong> field this amount will not be treated as being deprivation/gift of the controllers</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Distrb Ceased&#58;</strong> If the distribution amount is set to zero and the customer has received the final distribution, enter '<strong>Y</strong>'. This will help when deciding which trust/company records can be archived and which should be selected for a program review. It is essential to leave this field blank if the customer may receive a distribution in the future</li>
		<li>
<strong>Multiple Distributions&#58;</strong> If a Trustee resolves to make multiple distributions to a customer within a financial year, each distribution will need to be assessed as income for a period of 52 weeks from the date of the resolution to distribute. For example, if the Trustee resolves to make a distribution of $5,000 on 1 August 2015, a <strong>TRD</strong> screen will be recorded with a date of event of 1 August 2015 and a distribution amount of $5,000. If the Trustee resolves to make a further distribution of $2,000 on 1 March 2016, a new <strong>TRD</strong> screen will need to be recorded with a date of event of 1 March 2016 and a distribution amount of $7,000 ($5,000 plus $2,000). If no further distributions are made to the customer, the <strong>TRD</strong> screen needs to be recorded with a distribution of $2,000 ($7,000 - $5,000) from 30 July 2016 (for example 52 weeks after the resolution to distribute) and a <strong>TRD</strong> screen with a nil distribution and a date of event of 28 February 2017. A review should be set to follow up any further distributions and update the <strong>TRD</strong> screen as required, 52 weeks after each distribution</li>
		</ul>
<p>Code a review on the Review Registration (<strong>RVR</strong>) screen in the trust record&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Serv Rsn&#58;</strong> TRF</li>
		<li>
<strong>Rev Rsn&#58;</strong> TDI</li>
		<li>
<strong>Due Date&#58;</strong> this will be 52 weeks from the date of each distribution</li>
		<li>
<strong>Text&#58;</strong> include details of updates that need to be made to the trust record, such as follow up any further distributions</li>
		</ul>
<p>This process will normally form part of coding of all an entity's income, assets and attribution details. As such, ensure distribution details are included when completing a <strong>DOC</strong> outlining the actions taken.</p>

<p>The Trust/Company Distribution Summary Screen (<strong>TRDS</strong>) will display&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the event date</li>
		<li>
the total distributions to non-genuine investors or non-concession amounts</li>

the total distributions to genuine investors or concession amounts</li>		</ul>

<p>There are special provisions for customers experiencing Family Domestic Violence (FDV) where previous trust or company distributions affect their rate of income support payment (ISP) or entitlement to Low Income Card (LIC).</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, Department of Social Services (DSS) may grant an exemption for distribution/divided income. Complex Assessment Officers (CAO's) refer applications for an exemption to the Means Test Helpdesk for assessment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the exemption can only apply where the customer is not an attributable stakeholder of the entity.<br>If the CAO has assessed the customer as an attributable stakeholder, procedure ends here</li>
		<li>
in cases where the FDV involves a partner, the customer and partner must be separated for the exemption to apply.<br>If the customer remains partnered, procedure ends here</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following information is required&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
consent from the customer to be referred to a social worker to obtain FDV verification</li>
		<li>
explicit authority from the customer for DSS to access their record, <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Family_Domestic_Step02">go to Step 2</a></li>
		<li>
confirmation the customer is affected by FDV, <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Family_Domestic_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>
		<li>
details of distribution/dividend income assessed per Table 1</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the required information is gathered, <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Family_Domestic_Step04">go to Step 4</a></p>

<p>To apply for the exemption, the customer needs to provide written authority to allow Services Australia to provide information, and allow DSS to access their record to assess an exemption. If for any reason written authority cannot be obtained, get verbal consent. </p>

<p>Suggested wording&#58; 'I &lt;customers name&gt;, consent to Services Australia providing information to the Department of Social Services (DSS), and consent to DSS accessing my Centrelink record for the purposes of making an assessment regarding my trust/company income distribution/dividend' </p>

<p>Social workers identifying a customer may be eligible for exemption must request written authority when referring to a CAO. <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Family_Domestic_Step03">Go to Step 3</a>.</p>

<p>Where a CAO identifies the customer may be eligible for the exemption, they must discuss the requirement with the customer and advise they will be referred to a social worker. <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Family_Domestic_Step03">Go to Step 3</a></p>
