<p>The document outlines the Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS) and how deductions can be made from a customer's payment to pay for government housing payments.</p>

<h2 id="On this Page&#58;">On this Page&#58;</h2>


<p></p>
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Rent_Deduction_"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Rent_Deduction_">Rent Deduction Scheme</h2>


<p>The RDS allows Services Australia (the agency) customers to have their government housing payments deducted from their Centrelink payment each fortnight and sent directly to the appropriate state or territory Housing Authority (HA). This is a free service.</p>

<p>Customers&#58;</p>		<ul>		<li>

can participate in the RDS voluntarily if they receive an eligible income support payment</li>		<li>

can withdraw from the RDS at any time and have their deductions cancelled. They do not need to give a reason</li>		<li>

will get a letter when their RDS deduction starts, is varied or cancelled</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; The RDS is similar to Centrepay however, RDS is<strong> only</strong> used for government housing payments to a state or territory housing authority. Centrepay <strong>can not</strong> be used for government housing payments.</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_RDS_Agreements"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_RDS_Agreements">RDS Agreements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The RDS was established to increase efficiencies for all HAs and to improve customer service. It is governed by formal agreements between the agency and each of the 8 state and territory housing authorities. The agreement details the responsibilities and services available to each party.</p>

<p>A list of Housing Authority Customer Reference Numbers is available.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Voluntary_natur">Voluntary nature of RDS </h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Participation in the RDS is voluntary for customers, including those who are income managed. However, some HAs have signing up for RDS as a requirement in their tenancy agreement. </p>

<p>The voluntary nature of RDS is consistent with the 'inalienability' provisions of the Social Security Act 1991, which protects social security payments from being accessed by third parties (such as creditors) against the customer's wishes. It is also consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in schedule 1 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth).</p>

payment of government rent (<strong>RNT</strong>)</li>

repayment of HA loans (<strong>LON</strong>)</li>

payment of HA arrears (<strong>ARR</strong>)</li>

other housing payments (<strong>OHP</strong>)</li>
		<li>
other housing organisation payments (<strong>OHO</strong>) (Note&#58; ‘<strong>OHO</strong>’ organisations are community housing organisations. These properties are not government housing properties or managed by a state and territory housing authority). </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Customers who pay government rent (<strong>RNT</strong>) to a state and territory housing authority do not qualify for rent assistance unless they are an eligible government sub-tenant. Customers who pay rent to a community housing organisation (<strong>OHO</strong>) may qualify for rent assistance depending on the amount of rent paid.

<p><strong>Housing Authorities (HA)</strong></p>

<p>Housing Authorities start, vary and cancel RDS deductions by sending the details to the agency electronically.</p>

<p>Customers must contact their local housing authority to start an RDS deduction.</p>

<p>The HA calculates the amount of rent the customer needs to pay based on the income of the household. Then the HA will ask the customer to sign a housing deduction authority form which gives their consent for the agency to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
deduct the agreed amounts from their Centrelink payment</li>
		<li>
transfer the deducted payment amount to the HA</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; HAs have their own deduction authority forms which are used to collect consent for RDS deductions. The agency <strong>does not</strong> have a form for RDS. </p>

<p>HAs must make sure their staff understand their obligations for privacy and confidentiality, under the Crimes Act 1914, Privacy Act 1988 and Social Security Act 1991, as set out in the RDS Agreements.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Services Australia</strong></p>

<p>Agency staff&#58;</p>

can cancel RDS deductions at the customer’s request. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08130030-01.html">Terminating a Rent Deduction Scheme (RDS) deduction</a></li>
		<li>
cannot start, restart or vary RDS deductions</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Program Support Managers from the Third Party Programs Team manage the relationship between the agency and the HA.</p>

<p>The National Business Gateway Confirmation Services provide a helpdesk support service to HAs for technical support and system issues regarding the scheme. </p>

<p><strong>Self-service</strong></p>

<p>Customers cannot start, vary or cancel RDS deductions themselves using self-service or online channels </p>

<p>Customers can use their Centrelink online account in myGov or Express Plus mobile app to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check a summary of all their deductions, including RDS deductions</li>
		<li>
get a <a href="../self-service/133-04020020-01.html">deduction statement</a> which shows all deductions coming out of their payment, including RDS deductions. This statement can also be requested through phone self-service</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers should encourage customers to check their RDS deductions regularly via self-service to ensure that they are correct.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p><strong>Cancellation or suspension of payment</strong></p>

<p>When a customer's Centrelink payment is cancelled or suspended, the RDS deduction instruction is kept current for the standard 'grace' period (13 weeks for all payments). If the customer returns to payment within that period the deduction instruction will be re-activated automatically and pays to the HA from the customer's next pay day.</p>

<p>The deduction that recommences will not include any arrears that may be owed. Customers must contact their relevant HA to organise repayment of rent owed for any missed rent payments.</p>

<p>If the customer does not return to payment within the grace period of 13 weeks, the deduction will cancel. The HA will receive a termination advice (ITI) on their next deduction report for the instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Reduced or nil rate of payment (CZR)</strong></p>

<p>When a customer’s Centrelink payment is reduced or nil, this may result in part or none of their RDS deduction being paid. The amount of RDS deduction that can be paid will be dependent on other deductions the customer has set up and the priority order of their deductions. Customers must contact their housing authority to organise paying any missed rental payments.</p>

		</ul>
<p>When a Service Officer processes a new claim or inter-benefit transfer of payment for a customer with existing RDS deductions they must check the Payment Instructions Summary screen (<strong>PINS</strong>) to check if RDS deductions are automatically transferred to the new payment.</p>

Each HA must only submit one RDS file for processing each business day </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a previous processing day is missed the HA must still only submit one only file for the next scheduled processing. Submitting more than one RDS file on any single day will cause all RDS processing for all Housing Authorities to fail.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The RDS file must be lodged by 12pm AEST/AEDST.</li>
		<li>
If a Housing Authority is not going to submit an RDS file for processing (for any reason) they must give prior notification to the National Business Gateway - Confirmation Services Helpdesk. Failure to notify will cause all RDS processing for all HAs to fail</li>
		<li>
If there are no transactions for a particular day the relevant HA must&#58;</li>

ask the Helpdesk for the processing job to be cancelled, or</li>
			<li>
submit a ‘blank file’ with a header and trailer record with the correct sequence number and a transaction count of zero</li>		</ul>

There is no RDS file processing on public holidays. For national and local public holidays, the Helpdesk will email all Housing Authorities to confirm if they will be lodging a file on that day</li>
