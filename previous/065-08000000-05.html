Repayments reduce the balance, and interest is adjusted from the day they are allocated to the legacy system</li>

		</ul>
<p>Interest for a Day = (Principal + Costs + Interest) â€“ Repayments) x Interest Rate/364</p>

<p>Interest calculates using the previous Entitlement Period End Dates (EPED) balance for first 13 days. Then adding the fortnightly payment on day 14 of the EPED to complete the fortnightâ€™s interest calculation. If there is no fortnightly LON component, each day calculates based on the previous balance. The interest is added to the total loan balance on a fortnightly basis..</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; What is the HEAS?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; The HEAS is a reverse mortgage like loan for older Australians secured against real estate they own in Australia. </p>

<p>The agency places a registered charge or caveat against the property title to protect the Commonwealthâ€™s interest. You need to repay the loan payments received and the costs and compound interest.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; How much loan can I receive?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
Your loan payment is based on the Maximum Pension Rate and how much pension you get each fortnight</li>
		<li>
The combined fortnightly rate of pension and loan is capped at 150% of your maximum pension rate</li>
		<li>
You can choose the amount of loan per fortnight and the loan payment will automatically adjust to not go over the cap if your pension changes</li>
		<li>
If you donâ€™t receive a pension payment you can get up to 150% of the Maximum Pension Rate as loan payments</li>
		<li>
If you choose to receive your loan as a lump sum advance, it may affect the amount of fortnightly loan payments you receive</li>
		</ul>
<p>The amount of accumulated debt you can build up depends on your age and value of the real estate you offer as security.</p>

<p>To see whether you might be eligible go to&#58; </p>
