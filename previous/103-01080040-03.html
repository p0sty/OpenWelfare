<p>Financial exploitation is where a person is subject to undue pressure, harassment, violence, abuse, deception or exploitation for resources by another person and/or people, including other family members and members of a community.</p>

<p>Care needs to be taken as customers experiencing family and domestic violence can be subject to financial exploitation.</p>

<p>Discuss the following in relation to the last 12 months&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the customer has a password protected or Restricted Access record, ask them for the reason why, and if the issue has been resolved</li>
		<li>
Does the customer find it difficult to say no to some family members or others when asked for money?</li>
		<li>
Does the customer need to hide money or have secret money?</li>
		<li>
Is the customer having trouble meeting their priority needs or making their money last from one pay to the next because they are paying things for other people or giving other people their money?</li>
		<li>
If third parties have been contacting the agency, why have they been contacting, and has this been at the request of the customer. Is the customer aware that third parties had been contacting?</li>		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>
Select a financial vulnerability factor radio button to expand the question set and complete the <strong>Current factor notes</strong> field</li>

If a previous assessment has been completed for a factor the factor notes can be viewed, or copied into the current assessment's factor notes by selecting the <strong>Copy history</strong> checkbox</li>

<strong>Financial exploitation</strong> - The customer has control over their money and is not subject to financial exploitation</li>
