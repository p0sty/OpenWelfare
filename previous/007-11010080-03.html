<p>It is preferred that customers advise non-lodgement using self service channels. Only run this workflow if either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer has language or literacy barriers affecting their capacity to complete updates via self-service</li>
		<li>
the customer is advising non-lodgement for a year more than 3 years in the past</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Remind</strong> customers of the importance of accurately providing their income within the non-lodgement advice so that their entitlements are correctly assessed. If the customer is unsure of their lodgement requirements, customers are to use the 'Do I need to lodge' tool on the ATO website.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons</strong> customers are required to lodge a tax return include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Having taxable income above the relevant tax free threshold</li>
		<li>
Having paid tax or had tax withheld from any source of Australian income, regardless of the amount paid, including income support payments</li>
		<li>
Being a liable or recipient parent of a child support assessment and did not receive an income support payment (ISP) for the full financial year</li>
		<li>
Having an interest in a business, such as being self employed</li>
		<li>
Having reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions, net investment losses or tax exempt foreign income</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Check the following information to determine if the customer or their partner&#58;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Received taxable income or had tax withheld</strong></p>

<p>Single Touch Payroll (STP) data can be viewed on the STP Data for FTB Customer (<strong>STPF</strong>) screen in Process Direct.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Help</strong> on the <strong>STPF</strong> screen for more information about the screen fields.</p>

<p>Enter the relevant <strong>Financial Year</strong> and select <strong>search</strong>.</p>

<p>This will display <strong>Payroll Data Indicators</strong> for the customer and partner where applicable&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Payroll information exists</strong> for customer/partner will present with Y if their employer has provided information.</li>
		<li>
<strong>A tax return is required</strong> (based on STP data only) will present a Y if there is a reason the customer/partner is to lodge a tax return, otherwise this will be N</li>
		<li>
<strong>Customer/Partner reasons for tax return</strong> will display if the customer/partner has a tax return requirement&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
had tax withheld, regardless of the amount of income</li>
			<li>
taxable income above the tax free threshold</li>
			<li>
any amount of reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions or tax exempt foreign income</li>
			<li>
Payroll information will display the amount of salary and wages for the customer only. Partner income will not be displayed</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the 'Reconciliation income source' field on the <strong>STPF</strong> screen should not be used to determine if income has been confirmed or if reconciliation has completed.</p>

<p><strong>Received an ISP during the non-lodgement year</strong></p>

<p>In Customer First,  view their ISP status on the FTB Income Support Explanation (<strong>FTBISPX</strong>) screen. Check payment periods on the Benefit Status (<strong>XBS</strong>) screen. This can impact which exemption reason code should be used</p>

<p><strong>Was entitled to receive child support</strong></p>

<p>In Customer First, go to the Maintenance Explanation Summary (<strong>MNEX</strong>) screen and change the financial year to the year the customer is advising non-lodgement for. If&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is an amount (including $0.00) on the <strong>MNEX</strong> screen, the customer/partner may have had a child support assessment during the relevant financial year. If the amount shows as $0.00, go to the Maintenance Entitlement Group Summary (<strong>MNGS</strong>) suite of screens (Maintenance Action Result (<strong>MNMR</strong>) and Maintenance Child Annual Entitlement (<strong>MNCE</strong>) screens for the relevant child) to check what the $0.00 represents</li>
		<li>
the amount was <strong>$0.00</strong> because the customer/partner&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>had a child support assessment of $0.00</strong>, record <strong>Yes</strong> to the question 'Were you entitled to receive child support?' in the workflow</li>
			<li>
<strong>did not have a child support assessment</strong> (e.g. the child support payer was deceased, the children were all from the current relationship, the children were all exempt from the MAT), record <strong>No</strong> to the question 'Were you entitled to receive child support?' in the workflow</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Received any foreign pension income during the relevant financial year</strong></p>

<p>Check the Foreign Income/Assets/Pension Summary (<strong>FIPS</strong>) screen for any foreign pension income. Take note of this amount to include in the <strong>Foreign Income</strong> section of the workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Was in a Blended family</strong></p>

<p>In Customer First, check the Blended Families Split FTB Rate (<strong>FBSR</strong>) screen. If they are from a blended family, run the workflow on both records</p>

<p>Information from the following screens can help to determine if a customer's <strong>income and non-lodgement declaration is reasonable</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Employment income (<strong>EANS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Taxable entitlement (<strong>TXGS</strong>)</li>

<strong>Yes</strong>, further discuss the lodgement requirement with the customer. If the customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
agrees that a tax return is needed, record details of the discussion.

<p>Possible reasons why a non-lodgement exemption may <strong>not</strong> be accepted&#58;</p>

<p>Whether or not the non-lodgement exemption is accepted, the workflow <strong>must</strong> be finalised to ensure the income details provided are updated on the record for FTB, CCB and CCS.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Their taxable income was above the tax free threshold</li>
		<li>
They paid tax on income</li>
		<li>
They had exempt reportable fringe benefits, reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions, net investment losses, or tax exempt foreign income</li>
		<li>
They were self-employed or had an interest in a business</li>
		<li>
They paid or were entitled to receive child support and were not on income support for the full financial year. If they answer <strong>yes</strong> to being a payer or payee of a child support agreement, the workflow will check if they have been on income support for the full financial year&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if they have, the workflow will accept their declaration (if all other relevant information is accepted)</li>
			<li>
if they have not, their advice is 'not accepted'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The income estimate was deemed 'unreasonable'</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If '<strong>N</strong>' was recorded in the <strong>Does the income declaration appear reasonable?</strong> field, the income will not be recorded on the <strong>FIPY</strong> screen and the not required to lodge advice will not be accepted. If they subsequently lodge a non-lodgement advice with the ATO, FTB/CCB will be reconciled using the customer's most recent estimate. For CCS reconciliation to occur, the customer will need to contact to provide reasonable income details</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Declaration - for not accepted</strong></p>

<p>Read declaration to the customer and check they acknowledge it.</p>

<p>They must contact the ATO for help with lodging a tax return or completing an ATO non-lodgement advice. See <a href="../families/007-11010080-05.html">Resources</a> page for links to the ATO website.</p>

<p>Do not provide tax advice. Refer them to the ATO website to check their details.</p>

<p>If the customer submits a non-lodgement advice with the ATO, details will transfer from the ATO and used with their most recent estimate to reconcile FTB, CCB and SIFS. If a non-lodgement advice is lodged with the ATO, confirmation from the ATO will be used with their most recent estimate to reconcile FTB/CCB/SIFS.</p>

<p>For CCS reconciliation, the customer will need to contact to provide income details.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Customer acknowledges</strong> box and <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>

<p>Continue workflow. The income estimate will be updated on the <strong>FIPY</strong> screen if it was considered reasonable, but a non-lodgement exemption is not recorded on the <strong>FNLE</strong> screen. A <strong>DOC</strong> is recorded by the workflow.</p>

<p>View the result on the Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen for correctness before finalising.</p>

<p>Advise the customer what information is still required.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
To receive their full FTB entitlement, income lodgement requirements must be met by 30 June of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12 or earlier years)</li>
		<li>
If <a href="../families/007-07030010-01.html">special circumstances prevent them from meeting certain family assistance lodgement requirements within the 1 year timeframe</a>, a lodgement extension may be granted</li>
		<li>
FTB reconciliation can occur if only an ex-partner's actual income details are required. However, SIFS can only be paid for a partnered period if the partner's taxable income is known. See <a href="../families/007-11010020-01.html">FTB reconciliation or lump sum claim pending</a></li>
		<li>
Reconciliation may also remain pending where the outcome is a debt, and there is a pause on debt raising due to a declared major disaster or emergency event such as a pandemic</li>		</ul>

<p>The Non-Lodger Exemption (<strong>FNLE</strong>) screen will <strong>not</strong> display in the QOL Checking Tool.</p>

<p>To make sure the Family Assistance Office non lodgement exemption workflow activities are correct, check the following screens&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Tax payment Summary (<strong>TXGS</strong>) and or <strong>TXYTD</strong> screen to determine if the customer/partner/ex-partner has been on an income support payment for 365 days and/or had tax withheld from their income support payment</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the person had any tax withheld from their income support payments, the Service Officer <strong>must</strong> record '<strong>Yes</strong>' to this question</li>
			<li>
If the customer has advised <strong>income less than</strong> the <strong>Information on record</strong> section of the workflow for income support payments received during the relevant financial year, and the Service Officer determines it is a reasonable estimate, they <strong>must</strong> record an explanation in the <strong>Fast Note</strong> to support this amount</li>		</ul>
		<li>
FAO Income Summary Details (<strong>FISD</strong>) to determine if the customer/partner/ex-partner may have been paying child support during the relevant financial year</li>
		<li>
If an amount greater than $0.00 is displayed, but the customer advises no child support was paid, the Service Officer <strong>must</strong> record an explanation in the <strong>Fast Note</strong></li>
		<li>
Main Explanation Summary (<strong>MNEX</strong>) to determine if the customer/partner/ex-partner was entitled to receive child support during the relevant financial year&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If there is an amount greater than $0.00, the customer/partner has been entitled to receive child support</li>
			<li>
The Service Officer <strong>must</strong> record '<strong>Yes</strong>' to the question '<strong>Were you entitled to receive child support</strong>?'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
FTB/CCF Manual Intervention (<strong>FAMIV</strong>) screen to determine if the activity should be sent to the MIV team for action</li>
		<li>
Non-lodger Exemption (<strong>FNLE</strong>) to determine if the Non-Lodgement Exemption reason has been correctly assessed</li>
		</ul>
<p>The information from the following screens is to be used as a guide only&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
STP Data for FTB Customer (<strong>STPF</strong>) screen (in Process Direct only)</li>
		<li>
Employment income (<strong>EANS</strong>)</li>
		<li>

		<li>
Real estate and business (<strong>REBS</strong>)</li>

Non- taxable entitlement (<strong>TXGS</strong>)</li>

Trust and companies (<strong>TRCIAS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Foreign Income/Assets/Pension Summary (<strong>FIPS</strong>)</li>
		<li>
Payment Summary (<strong>PS</strong>)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer advises an amount less than the above screens and the Service Officer determines it is a reasonable estimate, the Service Officer <strong>must</strong> record an explanation in the <strong>Fast Note</strong> to support this amount.</p>

<p>After completing these checks, if it is determined any of the <strong>Non-lodgement questions</strong> have been incorrectly answered and a non-lodgement declaration incorrectly accepted, return the activity under <strong>Is there a Rate error</strong> transaction question, '<strong>Application of Non-Lodgement exemption incorrect</strong>'.</p>

<p>If an <strong>incorrect Reason for Non-lodgement</strong> has been coded and this has no effect on acceptance of the exemption, release the activity with feedback.</p>
