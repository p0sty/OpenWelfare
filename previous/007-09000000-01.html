A family income test will be introduced, in addition to the individual income test. If the customer does not meet the individual income test, then the family income test limit is applied. This applies to both single and partnered customers</li>

A cap of 18 weeks/90 days will apply for customers who are partnered at the date of claim.

Customers who are single at the date of claim can take all 100 days, no cap is applied</li>

Customers no longer need to have ‘primary care’ of the child on their PPL days, just ‘care’. As more than one customer can have care of a child on a day, multiple customers can claim PPL on the same day. There is a maximum of 10 concurrent dates per child. This means a maximum of 10 PPL days can be taken by customers for the same child on the same day</li>
		<li>
Fathers and partners may be payable for PPL where the birth mother does not meet the income test or residency test, or is serving a newly arrived residents waiting period (NARWP).

<p><strong>COVID-19 Disaster Payment (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021)</strong></p>

<p>Customers who received a COVID-19 Disaster Payment (paid by Services Australia on or after 3 June 2021) during their 10 month qualifying period and lodged their PPL claim on or after 4 September 2021, can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
include their COVID-19 Disaster Payments as qualifying work in the work test</li>
		<li>
backdate their PPL period nominated start date to their child’s date of birth/adoption</li>
		<li>
backdate their flexible PPL days more than 42 days in the past</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who performed at least 1 hour of paid work or paid leave (including weekends) and received COVID-19 Disaster Payment can count whichever is greater&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
7.6 hours for each weekday in the period (not including weekends)</li>
		<li>
The number of hours actually worked each day (including weekends)</li>
		<li>
The number of hours of paid leave each day</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers who lodged their PPL claim on or after 4 September 2021 and who received COVID-19 Disaster Payment during their 10 month qualifying period, can backdate their nominated PPL period start date to a date on or after their child’s date of birth/adoption. This can occur even if an effective claim is lodged or proof of birth/entry into care is provided more than 28 days after the date of birth/adoption. </p>

<p>From 4 December 2021, the online claim will check whether the customer received any COVID-19 Disaster Payments within their 13 month work test period. Where a customer received the payment, the online claim will ask the customer whether it was received in their 10 month qualifying period. If the customer selects ‘Yes’ the claim will allow the customer to select a nominated start date from the date of birth/adoption (regardless of the date of claim). </p>

<p>These customers can also select flexible PPL days that are more than 42 days in the past, if all other conditions are met. This COVID-19 Disaster Payment information will be available on the PPL Work Test History (<strong>P1WH</strong>) screen. In addition, the Paid Parental Leave Exemption (<strong>P1EX</strong>) screen will display ‘Backdating the start date’. </p>

		</ul>
<p>Family and domestic violence claims must be referred to a social worker who will assess whether family and domestic violence affected the customer’s ability to work during their work test period. The social worker may contact the customer to discuss the circumstances over the phone. If there is enough evidence already on the customer’s record, the social worker can complete a file assessment. </p>

<p>The customer will be requested in the claim to provide evidence to confirm the family and domestic violence, but if it is not provided, the social worker will determine if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
there is already enough evidence on the customer’s record, or</li>
		<li>
if further evidence is required</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers must not request evidence of the family and domestic violence. See <a href="../families/007-17100602-03.html#bp03_tbl_Checks_required02_Step04">Pre-processing checks for standalone and combined claims for family assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave payments, Table 3, Step 4</a>.</p>

<p>The customer will also be required to provide evidence from their employer confirming that the customer would have been employed during the work test period. The employer may not know why the customer was unable to work and the customer is<strong> not</strong> expected to disclose this information to their employer. See <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">Paid Parental Leave Work Test</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 1 January 2020 to 1 July 2020, several changes were made to PPL that included the following.</p>

<p><strong>PPL work test for children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2020</strong></p>

<p>There were 2 changes to the PPL work test&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the allowable gap between consecutive work days was increased from 8 to 12 weeks. In the 392 day work test period, a customer must not have a gap of more than 12 weeks during their 295 day qualifying period</li>
		<li>
the Dangerous Jobs provision was introduced. This provision only applies if customers/birth mothers stop work because a hazard in their workplace was/is, a risk to their pregnancy. This provision applies if customers have failed to meet the usual work test, and another work test exemption is not applicable. For example, pregnancy related complication/ illness exemption</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">Paid Parental Leave scheme Work Test</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Return to work exceptions for customers who returned to work on or after 12 March 2020</strong></p>

<p>There are several reasons a customer can return to work/perform work and continue to receive PPL. Allowable reasons for PPL include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an Australian Defence Force (ADF) member or law enforcement officer who is compulsorily recalled to duty</li>
		<li>
complying with a summons or other compulsory process to give evidence, information or produce documents. This does not include jury duty </li>
		<li>
health professionals, emergency services or essential workers who have returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency (effective from <strong>12 March 2020 onwards</strong>)</li>
		<li>
a newborn child remaining in hospital following the birth&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for birth mothers - the return to work can be disregarded if it occurs within the period that starts 14 days after the child is born and ends on the day the child is discharged from hospital. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; if the birth mother returns to work within 14 days of the child’s birth, this return to work cannot be disregarded and they will not be eligible for PPL from the date they return to work</li>
			<li>
for all other claimants - including secondary claimants and adoptive parents, the return to work can be disregarded if it occurs within the period that starts on the day the child is born and ends on the day the child is discharged from hospital</li>		</ul>
		<li>
care of the child was lost without legal authority </li>
		<li>
child bereavement where the DAP child was stillborn or died</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer returns to work for an allowable reason, an exception is recorded and their return to work is disregarded. See <a href="../families/007-05040040-01.html">Parental Leave Pay (PPL) customer, for a child born before 1 July 2023, returns to work</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Extended Work Test period for children born or adopted between 22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 (inclusive)</strong></p>

<p>The extended work test applies to customers who&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not meet the existing PPL scheme work test because they stopped work, or had their work hours reduced due to COVID-19, and</li>
		<li>
have a child with a date of birth or adoption between 22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021</li>
		</ul>
<p>These customers will have their work test period increased from 392 days to 600 days. During their 600 day work test period, the customer must have a 295 day qualifying period where they did not have a 12 week gap between consecutive work days and performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work within the 295 day qualifying period. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; although the customer can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between work days during the 600 day work test period, they cannot have this gap during their 295 day qualifying period.</p>

<p>This only applies to customers who cannot meet the usual PPL or DAP work test and do not have an exemption from the work test, such as pregnancy related complication/illness, premature birth or dangerous job provision.</p>

<p>The extended work test period for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PPL, is the 600 days before the child’s EDOB or DOB</li>
		<li>
DAP, is the 600 days before their DAP period start date</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">Paid Parental Leave scheme Work Test</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Flexible PPL for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2020</strong></p>

<p>Parental Leave Pay is made up of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a 12 week (60 day) PPL period, which must be taken within 12 months of the birth or adoption of the child, and</li>
		<li>
30 Flexible PPL days, which can be claimed any time after the PPL period and within 2 years of the child’s birth or adoption</li>
		</ul>
<p>Flexible PPL days can be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
connected to the end of the PPL period (to give the customer a continuous block of payment for up to 18 weeks) or accessed separately</li>
		<li>
paid before or after the customer has returned to work</li>
		<li>
given to another person to claim on days that they have primary care of the child</li>
		</ul>
<p>To be eligible for Flexible PPL on a day, a customer must meet PPL primary care and residency requirements and must not be working.</p>

<p>Customers must tell Services Australia when they want to get their Flexible PPL days. They can do this when they claim PPL or at a later time. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; customers who do not receive any PPL period may still be eligible for Flexible PPL days. For example, if they returned to work before they claimed PLP. </p>
