Complete the privacy statement. Advise the employer the reason for calling – to discuss their Boosting Apprenticeship Commencement (or Completing Apprenticeship Commencement) claim, or a Priority Subsidy (PWS) claim (Service Officers to specify the correct claim type)</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Services Australia may receive information from DEWR to verify the evidence provided with their claim, and</li>
		<li>
they can find more information on the agency’s privacy policy on Services Australia’s website</li>

<p>For example&#58;</p>

<p>“Good Morning / Afternoon, my name is [name]. I am calling from Services Australia on behalf of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations – DEWR…</p>

<p>…Before we proceed, I need to inform you that Services Australia may receive information from DEWR to verify the evidence provided with your claim. The call, and information viewed during the call, may be recorded for training and coaching purposes. You can find more information on our privacy policy on Services Australia’s website. I am calling to discuss your [BAC / CAC / PWS] claim…  ”</p>

<p><strong>Identifying employers – outbound contacts</strong></p>

<p>Employers may submit claims for more than 1 apprentice. When contacting an employer, advise the Claim application ID, or the Apprentice name the claim relates to.</p>

<p>Discuss no further information about the application without confirming the call recipient is the authorised person to discuss the relevant claim.</p>

claim application ID</li>

business name</li>

Advise them that you haven't been able to confirm enough information to discuss the claim at this time</li>

<p><strong>Employers querying multiple claims during outbound calls</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of an outbound call to an employer is to inform or remind them about information required for a specific Apprenticeship Wage Subsidy claim. Apply discretion, when providing further assistance to an employer asking them about other claims.</p>

<p>Where the employer asks about multiple claims, they should be advised that each claim will be reviewed on its own merits and that they will be contacted where more information is required.</p>

<p>If they feel that they have made an error with multiple claims, they should be encouraged to contact the Apprenticeship Wage Subsidy line to discuss these circumstances further.</p>

<p>Multiple claims for the same employer may be allocated together to staff for action. Each claim will need to be individually reviewed on its own merits, and actions taken must be recorded in the <strong>Service Notes</strong>.</p>

<p>The Work Allocation list will identify employers that have submitted multiple claims. This is known as a bundle. When staff are allocated a bundle&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
assign your logon ID against the employer for up to a maximum of 10 claims</li>
		<li>
make one outbound call to the employer to cover all of the claims requiring outbound contact, and</li>
		<li>
action these claims as per normal processes</li>		</ul>
