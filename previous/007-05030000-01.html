<p>This document outlines the eligibility criteria to receive Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). DAP is paid under the Paid Parental Leave scheme and aims to support dads or partners caring for a newborn or recently adopted child. It is a taxable payment paid at the national minimum wage for a maximum of 2 weeks (paid as a lump sum).</p>

child bereavement where the child was stillborn or has died</li>
		<li>
an Australian Defence Force (ADF) member or law enforcement officer who is compulsorily recalled to duty</li>

<p>Customers can still be eligible for DAP if they are working during their DAP period for a permissible purpose as a self-employed person.

<p>Permissible activities include&#58;</p>

arranging repair of equipment </li>
		<li>
paying an account</li>
		<li>
checking the delivery of an order</li>

<p>The customer must <a href="../families/007-03010030-01.html">provide proof of the child's birth</a> for their claim to be finalised.</p>

<p>Where PPL or FTB is claimed by the partner and they have supplied proof of the child's birth, this can be used for DAP.</p>

<p>If DAP is the only payment being claimed, the following birth verification can be used&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Newborn Child Declaration form (<strong>FA081</strong>) fully completed, or</li>
		<li>
Proof of birth declaration (back page of FA081). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> The back page of FA081 alone cannot be used to finalise a DAP pre-claim. In this circumstance, birth verification requires a fully completed FA081 or other acceptable proof of birth. Confirmation the customer has registered or has applied to register the child’s birth with the relevant state or territory registry of births must be obtained either verbally or in writing</li>
		<li>
Other <a href="../families/007-03010030-01.html">acceptable proof of birth</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>If the person lodging proof of birth is a biological parent of the child, they must have registered or applied to register the child's birth as required by the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry to meet the birth verification requirement for the child. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers advising they ‘intend’ to register the birth of their child with the relevant state or territory registry of births do not meet the birth verification requirement.</p>

<p>If the child is part of an adoption or surrogacy arrangement and the customer is not a biological parent they will be required to provide evidence of the surrogacy arrangement or adoption.</p>

<p>In the case of child bereavement where the child is stillborn or dies, the Claim for Bereavement Payment form (FA008) including a completed proof of birth page can be used as proof of birth for DAP.</p>

<p>The DAP period is the time a customer takes off work and receives DAP. This can be up to a maximum of 2 weeks, or it could be for a shorter period, for example, 1 week or 1 day. To receive DAP, the customer must be eligible on each day of the DAP period.</p>

<p>The DAP period must be 1 continual period of time.</p>

<p>Customers are required to tell Services Australia when they want their 2 week DAP period to start. This is the nominated start date. It can be the date of the child's birth, adoption or surrogacy or another date they have nominated.</p>

<p>The nominated start date&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
cannot be before the birth of the child, the date the child became entrusted to care, or the entry into care date</li>
		<li>
must be before 12 months (52 weeks) from the child's date of birth, the date the child became entrusted to care or the entry into care date and</li>

<p>To receive the full 2 weeks entitlement of DAP, the customer must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
 nominate a start date 14 days before the child's first birthday or anniversary of adoption or surrogacy</li>
		<li>
not be getting Parental Leave Pay (PPL) for the same child for any days during the DAP period. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this only applies to payments of PPL made to the customer. Another person, such as their partner, can receive PPL for the same child at the same time the customer is getting DAP</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers cannot receive JobKeeper Payment for the same period they receive DAP. Customers will need to provide their start and end date for their DAP period to their employer. Direct the customer to their employer for any enquiries about JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p>Customers cannot receive a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-21060323-01.html">COVID-19 Disaster Payment</a>, <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-20080418-03.html">Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment</a> or a <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-03010000-01.html">Disaster Recovery Allowance</a>, if they receive DAP.

<p>Exemptions may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Additional Circumstances (ACI) exemption is used when the customer would normally be ineligible for DAP based on their relationship to the child, however discretion has been used to exempt the customer from the usual relationship to child requirement </li>
		<li>
Left care without consent (LWC) exemption is used when the child leaves the customer's care without consent. This exemption indicates the customer meets the care requirement for DAP</li>
		<li>
Work history test (PCO) exemption is used when the customer would have met the work test based on the expected date of birth, but did not meet it based on the actual date of birth due to a premature birth of the child</li>
		<li>
Multiple Children Approved (MCA) exemption in the rare event there is a significant delay between the births of multiple children, for example 5 days apart </li>
		<li>
Disregard Work (DWO) exemption is used for DAP periods prior to 12 March 2020 for customers that returned to work due to allowable exception reasons</li>

<p>To be paid DAP for a child, the customer cannot be receiving DAP for another child at the same time.</p>

<p>One customer can receive both DAP and PPL for the same child. However, PPL and DAP periods must be taken at different times.</p>

<p>An individual customer can receive a maximum of 18 weeks of combined payments for the same child under the Paid Parental Leave scheme (for example, PPL and DAP combined).</p>

<p>A family can receive a maximum of 20 weeks DAP and PPL combined for the same child (for example, 2 weeks DAP may be paid to the father or partner at the same time that PPL is paid to the mother).</p>

<p>One customer can receive both DAP and PPL for different children at the same time.</p>

<p>DAP can be paid before, after or at the same time as other family assistance payments, for example Family Tax Benefit (FTB) including Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU).</p>

<p>DAP is taxable income and is included in a customer's adjusted taxable income for family assistance payments.</p>
