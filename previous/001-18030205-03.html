<p>When a mutual obligation failure is committed the resulting action is dependent on the Targeted Compliance Framework zone the job seeker is in.</p>

<p>Job seekers in the green or warning zone will receive a notice from ESS when they miss a requirement. The notice tells the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it appears they did not meet a requirement, and</li>
		<li>
they must contact their provider or their payment will be put on hold</li>
		</ul>
<p>To avoid payment suspension the job seeker must, within 2 business days&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact their provider to explain the reason for non-compliance, and</li>
		<li>
meet any re-engagement requirement issued by the provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>If they fail to contact and/or re-engage with their provider, their payment will be suspended after 2 business days.</p>

<p>The decision to suspend is made by either the Employment Services System (ESS) or the job seeker's provider. A trigger is sent to Services Australia electronically to trigger the suspension.</p>

<p>Job seekers in the penalty zone will have their payment suspended immediately when they miss a requirement. The decision to suspend is made either by the ESS or the provider. An automatic trigger is sent to Services Australia.</p>

<p>Types of participation suspensions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>TCW</strong> - Provider work refusal failure</li>
		<li>
<strong>TCF</strong> - Did not meet provider requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a participation suspension has been applied, compliance action will appear in the job seeker's <strong>Compliance summary</strong> under <strong>Completed/provider to action</strong> with the status of the compliance action as <strong>Yet to meet requirement</strong>.</p>

<p>The provider has full responsibility for setting and notifying job seekers of their re-engagement requirement following a mutual obligation failure.</p>

<p>Re-engagement requirements must be formally notified to the job seeker. The provider uses a verbal script to do that. The job seeker will receive a message telling them to contact the provider about the missed requirement when the job seeker's payment is suspended and they attempt to report prior to contacting their provider.</p>

<p>Re-engagement requirements issued by the provider, depend on the nature of the job seeker's missed requirement&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The re-engagement requirement will be to attend a provider appointment for&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
non-attendance or misconduct at an employment services provider appointment, third party appointment, job interview, or</li>
			<li>
failure to take satisfactorily action on a job referral</li>		</ul>
		<li>
The job seeker will generally be required to participate in the activity when there has been a non-attendance or misconduct at an activity, such as&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Workforce Australia - Work for the Dole</li>
			<li>
approved training or study, etc.</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Job seekers would need to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
agree to a Job Plan if they have failed to agree to one</li>
			<li>
satisfactorily complete job search where they have failed to do so</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For job seekers in Workforce Australia, including those in Workforce Australia Online, the re-engagement requirement for failing to meet the monthly points target is generally to make up the outstanding points in the next points period. They will not start accruing points towards the next monthly points target until they have met the re-engagement requirement</li>
		</ul>
<p>The application of a demerit can trigger a Capability Interview or a Capability Assessment. When this happens, the re-engagement requirement will be to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
attend a Capability Interview, or</li>
		<li>
contact Services Australia to arrange a Capability Assessment</li>		</ul>

<p>If the Provider Report (which triggers payment suspension) does not have a Compliance status of 'FNP - Finalised provider report' on the <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/elements/Participation-Compliance.html">Participation Compliance Hub</a> advise the job seeker to contact&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their provider, or</li>
		<li>
the Digital Services Contact Centre for job seekers linked to Workforce Australia Online</li>
		</ul>
<p>After talking to their provider or the Digital Services Contact Centre (for job seekers linked to Workforce Australia Online), if a job seeker is still not satisfied they can contact the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' National Customer Service Line.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> ESS sends triggers to the customer's Services Australia record. The trigger to restore payment can be delayed when either a staff member has a lock on the record, or the job seeker is using their online account.</p>

<p>Manual action by PST-skilled staff may be needed when all suspension reports have a status of 'finalised provider report' in the <strong>Participation Compliance</strong> workflow, but the payment has not restored.</p>

<p>Refer the job seeker to the Participation Solutions Team (PST) if they have contacted a Smart Centre or service centre.</p>

<p>PST-skilled staff must check for a manual follow up (MFU) activity. Check the suspension can be restored when there is no MFU.</p>

<p>The payment can be restored when the provider finalises all suspension reports by recording one of the following outcomes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Re-engagement met (REM)</li>
		<li>
Re-engagement not required/no longer required (RNR)</li>
		<li>
Cannot re-engage in 2 days (R2D)</li>
		<li>
Created in error (CIE)</li>
		<li>
Finalised by Provider (FBP)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Go into the Participation Compliance Hub to check if the Provider Report has been finalised as per the above. The payment can be manually restored via the Benefit Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen in Process Direct, if this has not already occurred. When restoring, complete the <strong>Restore (Payment Type) DOV</strong> <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Fast Note</a> and record any relevant information.</p>

<p>PST-skilled staff may reassess the CDR cancellation decision if there is evidence that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker contacted their provider or the Digital Services Contact Centre (for job seekers linked to Workforce Australia Online) and/or attended a re-engagement appointment however the provider/DSCC coding is incorrect or incomplete, resulting in an incorrect CDR cancellation</li>
		<li>
the incorrect appointment type was booked, for example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a contact appointment was booked instead of a re-engagement appointment</li>		</ul>
		<li>
attendance at the re-engagement appointment occurred, but a system error resulted in incorrect cancellation</li>
		<li>
contact with the provider/DSCC has confirmed the re-engagement has been met/no longer required</li>
		<li>
the job seeker was unable to meet their mutual obligation requirements on the incident date, or their circumstances have changed since the incident and they are no longer required to re-engage. For example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Their provider/DSCC no longer requires the job seeker to re-engage, or an exemption is or would have been granted during the TCF suspension period</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where evidence exists that an exemption would have applied, ensure the exemption is completed post restoration of payment.</p>

<p>Where evidence exists the cancellation is incorrect and the job seekers payment can be restored, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030205-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reengaging_job_8">Item 8</a>.</p>

<p>For examples of common CDR cancellation scenarios, see the <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030205-05.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<p>Where assistance or clarification is required to assess the ability to restore the payment, staff must consult with the PST SO5 to confirm if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
restoration of payment is appropriate, or</li>
		<li>
escalation to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk is required</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where insufficient evidence exists to indicate the job seeker has met, or was no longer required to meet their re-engagement requirement, advise the job seeker&#58;</p>

of their review and appeal rights, and</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a limiting date error is returned when attempting to restore payment, escalate via ROXY and hold the started activity. See <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-20050133-01.html">Using Digital Assistant Roxy in Process Direct</a>.</p>

<p>When restoring, ensure the <strong>Restore (Payment Type) DOV</strong> <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Fast Note</a> is completed and record any relevant information.</p>

<p><strong>Other considerations</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customers cannot report using self-service when it is more than 27 days after their oldest outstanding reporting date. A staff member may be required to complete the outstanding reports for the customer. See <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-04180000-01.html">Reporting employment income online for more information</a></li>
		<li>
The payment is restored from the date of effect. A letter is generated, advising the customer of the restoration. If a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity is created, see <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-14010000-01.html">Creating an Online Advice (OLA), including within an existing activity</a></li>
		<li>
As the payment has been cancelled, the job seeker registration may no longer be active. For information on re-registration with Workforce Australia, see <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-02060010-01.html">Selection or allocation of a Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider</a></li>
