<div class="showcont">


<p>Housing is a basic item.</p>

<p>To determine the amount to set aside for housing costs, use the following questions as a guide&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Does the customer have any obligation to pay for housing?</li>
		<li>
How are housing costs currently paid?</li>
		<li>
How much are the housing costs?</li>
		<li>
Is the person meeting the housing costs?</li>
		</ul>
<p>Complex living arrangements, and the contributions made by different members of a household may need to be taken into account when making housing payments. For example, one person may be responsible for paying the rent, while another pays for the food. If a request to pay rent on regular basis is above the amount payable by the customer as verified on the Accommodation Details (<strong>AC</strong>) screen, the reason for this must be included in any <strong>Expense Notes</strong> or <strong>DOC</strong>. Other than in these complex living arrangements, customers cannot access more than the amount verified on the AC screen. This is because it can result in the customer accessing income managed funds as cash.</p>

<p>Before requesting a regular or one off payment for housing costs, ensure the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer is on 'Manual IM'</li>
		<li>
The customer's Income Management available balance and level of unallocated income managed funds have been checked. This is to ensure there are sufficient funds to pay the expense</li>
		<li>
The customer's priority needs have been reviewed and </li>
		<li>
The Priority Needs Expenses workflow  completed and reflect the customer's current circumstances</li>
		<li>
The <strong>AC</strong> screen aligns with the customer's expense request</li>
		<li>
If rent is payable to <strong>commercial landlords</strong> or <strong>community organisations</strong>, expenses can be set up without verification of rent. However, customers should be encouraged to provide verification as soon as possible, (unless they are exempt from the requirement), as they may be eligible for Rent Assistance. For more information, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092609-01.html">Rent Assistance (RA) verification</a></li>
		<li>
Additional consideration is given when requests are received for housing costs for vulnerable customers or customers who are homeless or at risk of homelessness</li>		</ul>

<p>Customers paying rent to State Housing Authorities (SHA) can do so through deductions from one or both of their&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
income managed (IM) funds, or</li>
		<li>
deductions from their discretionary funds</li>
		</ul>
<p>Periodically, a customer's rent obligations increase and the following processes should be followed.</p>

<p><strong>Deductions from IM funds</strong></p>

<p>At the customer's request a Service Officer should update a customer's IM rent deduction to the State Housing Authority.</p>

<p><strong>Deductions from discretionary funds</strong></p>

<p>With customer consent the State Housing Authority will increase the rent deduction made using discretionary funds.</p>

<p><strong>Combination of IM and discretionary</strong></p>

<p>If the customer wishes to increase their SHA rent deduction and have it coded from a combination of both discretionary and IM funds, then the detail should be included in a <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-05050020-01.html">Fast Note</a> and forwarded to NBG </p>

<p>If assessment is taking place as a result of payment restoration and the customers Income Management is recommencing, talk to the customer to arrange payment to the SHA for missed payments. </p>

<p>Select <strong>Auto Text</strong>, use <strong>Income Management &gt; Update &gt; State Housing Authority deductions</strong>. Include the following information&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
New total amount that the customer needs to pay</li>
		<li>
The date from when the new amount applies</li>
		<li>
A breakdown of the amounts that the customer would like deducted from each component of their payment (income managed and discretionary funds), and</li>
		<li>
That the Service Officer has checked to ensure the customer has sufficient funds to enable the request to be actioned</li>		</ul>

<p>In all cases, Service Officers should seek verification of rent, however, customers should not have income managed funds withheld to meet their housing costs where verification is not provided. This is often the case for customers income managed under the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR) Youth measure, or customers experiencing <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-06010050-01.html">homelessness</a>.</p>

<p>When considering expense allocations, social worker and Income Management Contact Officer (IMCO) recommendations should be taken into account.</p>

<p>If the request is to pay a primary/head tenant, Service Officers should document discussions that have resulted in this arrangement being the most appropriate option for the customer.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong>, some vulnerable and VWPR customers do not have formalised rent arrangements in place and it may be determined that payment to the primary/head tenant is the most suitable arrangement in the customer's circumstances (it is only a short term arrangement, or this arrangement is required to secure the customer's accommodation).</p>

<p>These discussions should occur before creating an Expense Request and should be detailed in the <strong>Expense Request</strong> notes.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers are required to provide verification of their rent details to be paid Rent Assistance (RA) unless they are specifically exempt from the requirement. It is the referring Service Officers responsibility to assess a customer's entitlement for RA. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-18092609-01.html">Rent Assistance (RA) verification</a>.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Expense Management Summary</strong> screen to create an <strong>Expense Request. </strong>This will be mapped to NBG.</p>

<p>The <strong>Expense Notes</strong> must include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all known details of the customer's housing situation, if verification of rent cannot be provided, </li>
		<li>
a summary of why this is the most suitable arrangement for the customer, if payment is to a primary/head tenant </li>
		<li>
the third party's name (include details of third party, for example, owner, primary tenant, housemate, landlord etc.)</li>
		<li>
the third party's contact telephone number</li>
		<li>
the relationship of customer to the third party (for example, friend, family member, flatmate)</li>
		<li>
the third party's bank account details including Bank State Branch (BSB)</li>
		<li>
details if the third party is on Income Management</li>
		<li>
the full amount of arrears and the period to which this applies is to be included, if the expense request is for arrears of rent </li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
reference to the above information is to be included in the <strong>Expense Notes</strong>. However, when the customer cannot provide details, record this as <strong>not known</strong>. For example, whether the third party is income managed - not known</li>

<p>The payment of rent to a <strong>primary/head tenant</strong> rather than to a <strong>landlord</strong> is not preferable and is only permitted if all avenues to make the payment directly to the <strong>landlord </strong>have been considered.</p>

<p>If payment to the <strong>landlord</strong> is not possible (for example, customer cannot be added to the lease, landlord will only accept one payment) the customer should provide a rent certificate detailing the arrangement for verification purposes. This is even if the customer is not eligible for Rent Assistance (see Item 2 if the customer cannot provide verification).</p>

<p>Before assessing that payment to the <strong>primary/head tenant</strong> is the most appropriate option for the customer, Service Officers should explore the possibility of the customer paying for other priority needs (food, clothing, utilities etc.). This could be done from income managed funds, and they could pay rental expenses from discretionary funds.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Service Officers must inform customers that their request to pay a private landlord or primary/head tenant does not guarantee payment of the expense from income managed funds.</p>

<p>If the customer's Accommodation Details (<strong>AC</strong>) screen does not show current accommodation details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Income managed funds cannot be used to pay rent indefinitely. The <strong>AC</strong> screen should be updated as soon as possible, even if verification is not provided.</li>
		<li>
Discretionary funds may need to be used to pay the rent until documentation is provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>If contact with the private landlord or primary/head tenant cannot be made, a one off payment may be made pending receipt of the documentation. One off payments are not to continue for the long term.</p>

<p>Before creating an <strong>Expense Request</strong>, staff must complete the following checks&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer must have sufficient funds to pay the expense</li>
		<li>
The rent certificate should be scanned onto the customer's record (if possible). <strong>Note</strong>&#58; even if the customer is not eligible for Rent Assistance, when a request is made for income managed funds to be used to pay for accommodation, a rent certificate should be lodged for verification purposes. </li>
		<li>
The amount requested to be paid by the customer does not exceed the amount verified on the <strong>AC</strong> screen. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a request to pay rent on a regular basis is above the amount payable by the customer as indicated on the <strong>AC</strong> screen due to complex living arrangements, the reason for this must be included in the <strong>Expense Notes</strong>. Regular expense requests for rent should not exceed the verified amount paid by the customer as this could result in the customer accessing the funds as cash</li>
		<li>
The customer's priority needs have been reviewed, the Priority Needs Expenses workflow completed and accurately reflect the customer's current circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Payments to private landlords and primary/head tenants are made via scheduled transfer to the bank details provided in the Expense Request.</li>
		<li>
Scheduled transfers are commenced and varied by NBG only</li>
		<li>
A region lock (E2777PI&#58; No access) will prevent commencements and variations for payments to landlords and primary/head tenants by scheduled transfer, by Service Officers outside of NBG</li>
		<li>
Network staff can cancel the expense at any time if requested by the customer. Cancellation requests should not be sent to NBG for processing</li>
		</ul>
<p>After all the checks and actions are complete, to commence a new regular or one-off expense, create an <strong>Expense Request</strong> (via the <strong>Expense Management Summary</strong> screen). This is automatically mapped NBG to finalise.</p>

<p><strong>Existing private landlord or primary/head tenant</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Select the private landlord's or primary/head tenant's organisation Customer Reference Number (CRN) beginning with 555 (via the <strong>Expense Management Summary</strong> screen)</li>
		<li>
Select <strong>New expense category required</strong></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>New private landlord or primary/head tenant</strong>&#58; The Expense Notes must include the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a summary of why payment of rent to a <strong>primary/head tenant</strong> is the most suitable arrangement for the customer, that is, why payment cannot be made directly to the landlord (if applicable)</li>

<p>The agency should assess requests for Income Management payments to pawnbrokers on a case by case basis. Use the following principles when making decisions about whether to approve the payment or not.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a pawnbroker is not the same as a second hand dealer. A pawnbroker offers secured loans to people, with items of personal property used as collateral.</p>

<p><strong>Purchasing second hand goods</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is requesting payment to purchase an item, the Service Officer should determine if the item being purchased is one that the customer previously lodged with the store as collateral for a cash loan.</p>

<p>If necessary, contact the dealer to determine this. If the customer is simply wishing to purchase second hand goods and is not making payment to redeem goods then standard processing applies. Approval should be given for the purchase under existing Income Management policy.</p>

<p><strong>Repayment of loans or making payment to redeem goods lodged as security for a loan</strong></p>

<p>There is a risk in these transactions that the arrangement has been put into place solely for the purpose of gaining access to income managed funds as cash. This cash could then be used to purchase prohibited items.</p>

<p>There are, however, situations where the customer may have entered into the arrangement before becoming subject to Income Management. In these cases consider the following factors&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Are the customer's and their dependents' priority needs met? Payment of these debts must only be considered when current and reasonably foreseeable priority needs are met and there are income managed funds available</li>
		<li>
Was the arrangement put in place prior to the customer becoming subject to Income Management? If yes, this would indicate that the arrangement is not being used solely for the purpose of gaining access to income managed funds as cash</li>
		<li>
Is there a history of behaviour that indicates the customer is using the arrangement to avoid Income Management?</li>
		<li>
What was the cash used for? Did the customer use the cash to meet their daily living expenses or to meet their priority needs?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Referral to Income Management Policy helpdesk</strong></p>

<p>Service Officers must refer these requests to the Income Management Policy Helpdesk if the customer is requesting the payment to redeem goods lodged as security for a loan category. To do this&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
use the <strong>Expense Management Summary</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
complete the <strong>Expense request</strong> for payment, including the referral by NBG</li>
		<li>

<p>Customers can use income managed funds to purchase new or second hand vehicles from licensed motor vehicle traders or from private sellers.</p>

<p>As this is a large purchase for a customer, Service Officers should briefly summarise the following key points and include a detailed DOC outlining the discussions with the customer. </p>

<strong>Do their homework</strong>&#58; Suggest they shop around to ensure the vehicle is the best possible value for money</li>
		<li>
<strong>Affordability</strong>&#58; Remind the customer they must also be able to afford things like transfer fees/stamp duty, car registration and insurance and the ongoing costs of running a car</li>
		<li>
<strong>Private sellers</strong>&#58; Recommend the customer contact the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) (previously known as Register of Encumbered Vehicles (REVS)) to check for any money owed on the vehicle or whether it has been stolen</li>
			<ul>			<li>

<p>Private sales - while it is not possible to describe all situations the onus is on the customer to satisfy the agency that the arrangement is legitimate. The Service Officer should take the following factors into consideration when requesting these payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Is there a history of requests that indicates a pattern of behaviour?</li>
		<li>
Was the item for sale available or advertised generally?</li>

<p>Firearms and ammunition are considered to be a priority need only if a person can demonstrate that such items are necessary for employment. Firearms and ammunition are not considered to be a priority need in relation to food gathering. Hunting knives are not a priority need. Under Section 123TH of the Social Security (Administration) Act basic household items are priority needs. Basic household items include cutlery and kitchen utensils but not knives used for hunting.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; under <strong>Child Protection Income Management (CPIM),</strong> the priority needs of the children should be considered paramount.

<p>A lay-by is essentially a contract between a customer and a retailer whereby the customer pays for goods over a period of time rather than upfront.</p>

<p>Lay-by payments can be made using the BasicsCard or via deductions from a customer's Income Management account to the TPO.</p>

<p>Services Australia must not promote BasicsCard merchants who are selling fireworks. Service Officers can provide customers with a list of BasicsCard merchants but this will not indicate which merchants may be selling fireworks.</p>

travel to and from Agricultural Society Days</li>

an online credit card payment via the relevant Agricultural Society's website or</li>
		<li>
a Restricted Direct Payment (RDP) where no other option of payment is available. The amount of the RDP must not exceed the entry fees payable</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers can access priority needs while in town using their BasicsCard at approved BasicsCard merchants or by contacting the agency to arrange payment via another method.</p>

<p>Customers should make arrangement for sufficient funds to be transferred onto their BasicsCard <strong>before they travel</strong> by calling 1800 132 594 or accessing self-service.</p>

<p>Service Officers must <strong>DOC</strong> the customer's record when making an allocation for the Society Day entry tickets to identify when a customer is making multiple purchases. If it is apparent that multiple tickets are being purchased over time then a more detailed assessment of the customer's priority needs may be required or a referral to a senior officer.</p>

<p>Other show related purchases the customer wishes to make, such as rides or show bags, should be paid from their discretionary funds. However, if a customer requests to access unspent income managed funds to spend at a show, Service Officers should assess suitability for a <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01050110-01.html">Restricted Direct Payment</a>, ensuring priority needs continue to be met.</p>
