they are not eligible to register for self service, or</li>
			<li>
a service officer deems self service is not appropriate</li>

<p>Eligible customers applying for a student income support payment are presented with the SSL claim option if they indicate they will be studying an approved scholarship course.</p>

<p>Customers have the option to accept or decline the loan offered. The loan periods offered are based on the start and end dates of their course and their student payment.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="A self service option is available for customers&#58; Placed under section headings or general content where self service options are available." title="A self service option is available" />Customers who add or edit an approved scholarship course using the <strong>Manage study details</strong> online service can claim SSL during the update.</p>

<p>Before a loan can be issued, the customer must&#58;</p>

accept the Terms and Conditions for the loan</li>
		<li>
acknowledge they must repay the loan, and</li>
		<li>
have their Tax File Number verified by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a customer declines the SSL in their claim or new course update, they cannot use the '<strong>Apply for/Manage Student Start-up Loan</strong>' online service until their claim or update is processed and their course has started.</p>

<p>SSL debt raising is an automated process – SSL debt shells are not reviewed by the Debt Raising team prior to raising. Ensure SSL outcomes are correct before finalising activities, particularly when creating or offsetting debts.</p>
