<p>This document explains the processes about the Youth Bonus Wage Subsidy (YBWS) 26 week suspension period.</p>

<p></p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_for"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Eligibility_for">Eligibility for the YBWS initiative</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) will be responsible for determining a job seeker's eligibility for the YBWS initiative. They will send through an electronic notification to Services Australia when a job seeker is placed into employment under the YBWS initiative and if the current YBWS placement was 'Created In Error'.</p>

<p>A job seeker will be eligible to participate in the YBWS initiative if they satisfy all of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they are under 25 years of age at the time of entering the YBWS initiative, and</li>
		<li>
in receipt of JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA), and</li>
		<li>
is provider managed by a Workforce Australia or Transition to Work (TTW) provider</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers participating in the Community Development Program (CDP) or with Disability Employment Services (DES) are excluded from this initiative. Customers undertaking an apprenticeship are ineligible for YBWS as they are not considered to be job seekers.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Youth_Bonus_Wag01"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Youth_Bonus_Wag01">YBWS 26 Week Suspension Period</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The YBWS suspension period will apply where a job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is employed under the YBWS initiative, and</li>
		<li>
has completed the 6 fortnight employment income nil rate period or if they cease to qualify for JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) for an employment related reason. For example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
commence full-time, part-time or casual employment</li>
			<li>
have used all their working credit</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> in some cases job seekers may not be paid enough employment income to reduce their income support payment to nil, and therefore may not enter the 26 week suspension period and will continue to receive income support payments. The <a href="../job-seekers/001-17030800-05.html">Resources</a> page has additional information.</p>

<p>The job seeker's income support payment will auto-suspend (YBS) for a period of 26 weeks and a notification letter will be issued advising the job seeker that they have commenced the suspension period. This suspension period is in place so that if at any time during the 26 week period, the job seeker ceases their employment through no fault of their own, or the current YBWS placement was 'Created In Error', their income support payment can be restored.</p>

<p>If advice is received from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) that the current YBWS placement was 'Created In Error' and the customer's payment has a 'YBS/SUS' status, a Manual Follow Up (MFU) activity will be present on the record. The MFU activity will have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the keyword 'YBWSUPD' to prompt staff to take further action</li>
		<li>
the text 'DESE advised current YBWS placement was created in error. Manual follow-up required. See OpB 001-17030800 for details'</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a job seeker ceases employment through fault of their own, their income support payment cannot be restored. The income support payment is to be cancelled and the job seeker is to be told they have to lodge a New Claim. This may be subject to an unemployment preclusion period if an unemployment failure has been committed.</p>

<p>At the end of the 26 weeks suspension period, the job seeker's income support payment will cancel. Where a job seeker wants to return to income support payments outside of the 26 week suspension period, they will need to lodge a New Claim.</p>

<p>Customers on leave without pay for a period of time can have their payment restored if they are able to satisfy mutual obligation requirements including looking for work for the period they are on leave.
