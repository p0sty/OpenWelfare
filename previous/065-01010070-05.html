<p><strong>I have been approved for a home care package/residential care - do I need to complete a calculation of your cost of care?</strong></p>

<p>For care recipients who are in receipt of a means tested income support payment (ISP), their means assessment for home care will complete automatically. If a care recipient receives a means tested ISP and is a non-homeowner, their residential care means assessment will also complete automatically.</p>

<p>Customers can use the fee estimator tool on the My Aged Care website to get an indication of what they can be asked to pay. However to receive a pre-commencement letter we will need to complete a pre-entry means assessment. See <a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-18102618-03.html">Aged care means assessment - preliminary checks</a> to start this process.</p>

<p>It is not compulsory for a care recipient to complete a calculation of your cost of care for either home or residential care.</p>

<p>If the care recipient does not complete a means assessment or chooses not to disclose their income and/or assets information, they will be liable to pay the maximum fee depending on their cost of care. Either of these will result in a means assessment being completed as Means Not Disclosed.</p>

<p>A care recipient may have high income and/or assets which will make them liable to pay the maximum fees, this will be the same as if they choose not to disclose their means. Refer to My Aged Care - Residential Care Fee estimator for help to estimate aged care fees. See <strong><a target="_blank" href="../older-australians/065-09000000-01.html">A</strong>ged care means assessment</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Which Calculation of the cost of your care form will I need?</strong></p>

<p>When a care recipient enters home or residential care, the Aged Care Payment System will check if Services Australia or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs hold the required information to complete a means assessment.</p>

<p>If Services Australia or where applicable, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) does not hold sufficient information to complete an assessment, a letter will be sent to the care recipient from Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) or Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) advising that&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Where to find aged care forms</strong></p>

<p>Aged care forms can be accessed from the Services Australia website. The <a href="../older-australians/065-01010070-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms">Resources</a> page has a link to the forms. The care recipient should be encouraged to access the forms themselves where possible.</p>

<p>The Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care forms are available as either a digital (fillable) form or paper forms.</p>

<p>The digital form&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
will only ask questions relevant to individual circumstances, which may reduce the time required to complete the form</li>
		<li>
requires Adobe Acrobat reader to complete</li>
		<li>
cannot be printed until <strong>all</strong> of the questions have been answered</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the care recipient is unable to complete the digital form they can print and complete one of the paper forms.</p>

<p>If a care recipient advises they are unable to access the required form online, the form may be issued via the Customer First <strong>Mail Forms</strong> guided procedure.</p>

		<li>
Care recipients/nominees may also seek independent financial advice</li>
		</ul>
<p>Care recipients commencing a permanent residential care service on or after 1 July 2014 may be asked to pay a combination of fees depending upon their circumstances. Fee types include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Basic Daily Fee (BDF)</li>
		<li>
Means-Tested Care Fee (MTCF)</li>
		<li>
Accommodation Payment or Accommodation Contribution</li>
		<li>
Extra Service Fee (if the care recipient has elected to receive extra services as part of their agreement with the service provider)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services Australia (or DVA if applicable), are responsible for the assessment of assets and income to determine liability for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an MTCF (to contribute to the cost of care); and</li>
		<li>
accommodation costs</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Basic daily fee</strong></p>

<p>This fee applies to all care recipients and is equal to 85% of the single basic age pension.</p>

<p>The BDF covers daily living costs such as meals, laundry, cleaning, and utilities such as power and phones.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/schedule-of-fees-and-charges-for-residential-and-home-care">Department of Health and Aged Care's Schedule of Fees and Charges</a> for the current residential care BDF.</p>

<p><strong>Means-tested care fee (MTCF)</strong></p>

<p>The MTCF is a contribution towards the cost of care. It is determined by an assessment of combined income and assets and by the level of care that is required.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodation payment</strong></p>

<p>An accommodation payment covers accommodation costs.</p>

<p>It may be payable if the means-tested amount (as determined by the means assessment) on the date of entry to care is <strong>equal to or more than</strong> the maximum accommodation supplement (as determined in the Department of Health and Aged Care's Schedule of Fees and Charges). In this case&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care recipient will be assessed as 'not low means'</li>
		<li>
they will not receive government assistance with their accommodation costs</li>
		<li>
an accommodation payment will not be affected by changes to income and assets</li>
		</ul>
<p>Care recipients have 28 days from the date (or proposed date) of entry to care to choose how the accommodation payment will be paid. It can be paid either as a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Refundable Accommodation Deposit (RAD) paid in full, as a lump sum, or</li>
		<li>
Daily Accommodation Payment (DAP) paid as a daily amount which calculated following conversion of the RAD amount, or</li>
		<li>
combination of the RAD and DAP</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Accommodation contribution</strong></p>

<p>An accommodation contribution is a contribution towards accommodation costs.</p>

<p>It may be payable if the means tested amount (as determined by the means assessment) on the date of entry to care is <strong>less than</strong> the maximum accommodation supplement amount (as determined in the Department of Health and Aged Care's Schedule of Fees and Charges). In this case&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the care recipient will be assessed as 'low means'</li>
		<li>
the government will contribute towards accommodation costs</li>
		<li>
an accommodation contribution will be affected by changes to income and assets</li>
		</ul>
<p>Care recipients have 28 days from the date (or proposed date) of entry to care to choose how the accommodation contribution will be paid. It can be paid either as a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
refundable accommodation contribution (RAC) paid in full, as a lump sum; or</li>
		<li>
daily accommodation contribution (DAC) paid as a daily amount; or</li>
		<li>
combination of the RAC and DAC</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Extra service fees</strong></p>

<p>This fee is paid if the care recipient has elected to receive extra services as part of their agreement with the service provider. Extra services are available in extra service facilities only. These facilities are required to publish their extra service fees on the My Aged Care website.</p>

<p>Extra service facilities provide a higher standard of accommodation, not extra nursing care. They cover services such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
onsite hairdressing</li>
		<li>
pay television</li>
		<li>
special therapies such as massage</li>
		<li>
improved choice of meals and inclusions such as beer and wine</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>What will my fees be if I opt in to the post 1 July 2014 assessment rules?</strong></p>

<p>Care recipients can opt into the post 1 July 2014 assessment rules if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
they received a home care or permanent residential care service prior to 1 July 2014, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
they will be moving to a new service on or after 1 July 2014, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
they have not yet moved to the new service, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the new service type is the same as the previous service type (that is, moving from home care into home care, or residential care into residential care), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
they have not spent more than 28 days outside of care (other than on approved leave)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the care recipient requests only an <strong>estimate of fees</strong> if they opt in offer to book the customer an appointment with an <a href="../older-australians/065-21081646-01.html">Aged Care Specialist Officer (ACSO)</a>, or refer them to the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.myagedcare.gov.au/">My Aged Care website</a> or phone service for assistance with estimating fees when opting in.

<p><strong>Where the care recipient requests written advice of fees if they opt in</strong></p>

<p>The care recipient will need to undergo an aged care means assessment (unless they elect not to disclose their financial details, in which case they will be deemed Means Not Disclosed and will pay the maximum fees applicable to their care type and level of care).</p>

<p>The care recipient may qualify for a <strong>verbal application</strong> or they may need to complete a calculation of your cost of care.</p>

<p>See <a href="../older-australians/065-09000000-05.html">Aged care means assessment</a> for information regarding when a calculation of your cost of care is required.</p>

<p><strong>Why haven't my fees and charges been updated after I have advised of a change in my circumstances?</strong></p>

<p>Changes in aged care fees following a change in circumstances will not usually occur until the next Regular Review (QR).</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The QR is a reconciliation process that aligns the fees that a care recipient has paid, with the fees associated with their care needs, over the past quarter</li>
		<li>
The care recipient will need to wait for the QR for the fee change to be applied, and for any refund owing to be paid</li>
		</ul>
<p>Care recipients who receive an Income Support Payment (ISP) may be confused about the need to wait until the next QR for their fees to change. When there is a change in circumstances related to their ISP, the system applies the change immediately and the care recipient can see an immediate effect on their ISP. This is not the case for aged care fees and charges.</p>

<p>If it is identified that a care recipient would be <strong>significantly disadvantaged</strong> (for example, placed in financial hardship) if required to wait until the next QR for a change in ongoing fees and charges following a change in circumstances, they may request an immediate Ad Hoc Review of their ongoing fees and charges.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Ad hoc reviews can occur automatically (for residential care only, where there has been a significant change) or be undertaken manually (for both residential and home care)</li>
		<li>
a manual ad hoc review should only be undertaken where it has been determined that&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
an automatic ad hoc review will not occur</li>
			<li>
there has been a significant change in circumstances</li>
			<li>
the care recipient would be significantly disadvantaged if an ad hoc review is not undertaken</li>		</ul>
		<li>
an ad hoc review will not generate a refund (where a refund is due)</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the care recipient will be required to wait until the QR for any refund owing to be calculated and paid</li>
			</ul>			</ul>

<p>If the care recipient is residing in residential care and they have recently sold their home, in the majority of cases this will result in an increase to their fees. This is because, after the home is sold the value assessed is no longer capped at the First Asset Threshold. The whole value of the proceeds is assessed according to what has been done with the proceeds. The result is that the care recipient’s assessable assets increase, even though they may not have increased in ‘real terms’. This may not be anticipated by the care recipient and/or their nominee.</p>

<p><strong>Residential Care</strong></p>

<p>When a new entry into care is notified, an RCA/NCL will be created. It will complete automatically if the care recipient is in receipt of an income support payment and is a non-homeowner.

<p><strong>I am an aged care provider and I need assistance</strong></p>

<p>Aged care providers may contact either the Aged Care Means Testing Line or the Aged Care Provider Enquiry line directly.</p>

<p>Calls may also be transferred (announced) from the Aged Care Provider Enquiry Line to the Aged Care Means Testing Line when the original caller is on the line <strong>and</strong> the query relates to means testing (for example, the fee letter they have received appears to be incorrect).</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When this occurs, a Services Australia Workspace screen pop will appear and staff on the Provider Enquiry Line will have obtained the required information from the service provider to document the record</li>
		<li>
If the Provider Enquiry Line Service Officer does not have the service provider on the line, the correct procedure is for the Provider Enquiry Line Service Officer to contact the Aged Care means assessment team via email</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For contact details, see Office Locator (search <strong>RCA</strong>)</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Aged care providers are considered to have 'implied consent'. Usually these will be single issue or one-off type of contacts by third parties on behalf of a customer. However, ensure the care recipient's privacy is maintained. See <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04060020-01.html">Implied consent regarding third parties </a>for further information if required.</p>

<p>Where an aged care provider enquiry is not related to a means assessment, transfer the call (announced) to the Aged Care Provider Enquiry line.</p>

<p><strong>The following information must be obtained from the aged care provider and documented in the care recipient record&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The service provider's service ID and service name</li>
		<li>
Return contact details of the service provider (phone and email if possible) and the details of the care recipient (name, DOB and reference number)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>When an aged care provider contacts as they have not received a fee advice&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Check the applicable aged care system to determine whether a fee letter has been issued, and whether the information in the letter is correct. If required, re-issue the fee letter to all parties</li>

See Aged care letters task card in <a href="../older-australians/065-20110349-05.html">Aged care letters</a> for assistance if required</li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations when providing information to an aged care provider regarding fees&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the fee letter is incorrect, remediation of the care recipient's record should be undertaken to correct the issue and allow an updated letter to be generated as soon as possible. It is not necessary to seek further information from the care recipient where an administration error occurred</li>
		<li>
Services Australia is prevented from releasing any personal information about the care recipient to the provider</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The only exception is with regards to income and asset details used for means assessment purposes. This information can only be released if financial disclosure consent has been provided</li>
