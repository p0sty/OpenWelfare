<p>Children's bank accounts held in trust are covered by the assessment of private trusts from 1 January 2002. The delegation for the attribution decision rests with the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO). Attribution of control is based on the ordinary attribution principles of private trusts. If a customer is the legal controller and original source of the funds then 100% attribution will be to them. Deeming does not apply so do not code on the Savings Summary (<strong>SVS</strong>) - assess actual income (interest) and asset value.</p>

<p>Code simple bank accounts on the Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) and the Other Asset Summary (<strong>OASS</strong>) screens of the controller.</p>

<p>For a series of investments assessed as belonging to a trustee, coding is on the Trust and Company (TAC) system.</p>

<p>If the customer is advising&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
of changes to an account already <strong>on the OINS screen</strong>, update as required</li>
		<li>
for the <strong>first time</strong> of an account held in trust, request the account statements and ask the customer to complete the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05000000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Forms">'Assets held in trust for another person'</a> form. See<a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-01.html"> Requesting information (CLK)</a>. <br>When documents are scanned for processing, refer to the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)</li>

<p>Various payments are commonly called compensation. How each payment is assessed depends on its type and reason for payment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Social security law has a special means test for compensation paid for personal injury and is at least in part for economic loss. If a social security payment is directly reduced, recovered or precluded because of a compensation payment, it cannot additionally be assessed as the person's income, except for the Low Income Health Care Card (LIC). Decisions about how a particular personal injury compensation payment is assessed should be made by a Service Officer in a Compensation Recovery Team</li>
		<li>
Customer receives money to compensate for the loss of or damage to their buildings or personal effects, or to repay debt (for example, consumer credit insurance), the payment is not treated as income and is an exempt asset for social security purposes&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If the payment is invested, money earned on the investment is <strong>not</strong> deemed under the income test for an initial exemption of up to 12 months after the person receives the payment. An additional 12 months extension may apply for loss or damage of customer's principal home if certain criteria are met. For more information on exemption, see <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-03010030-01.html">Temporary vacation of principal home</a>. The payment is not an assessable asset. Assessment details can be found in <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04080040-01.html">Exempt lump sums</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Lump sum compensation</strong> payment paid to a customer for <strong>personal injury</strong> is <strong>not</strong> exempt from the assets test. The recipient may also be subject to a compensation preclusion period. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03190010-01.html">Compensation as Income</a> for assessment details</li>
		<li>
Ex-gratia payments made to a prisoner of war (POW) or civil internee of the Japanese or Europeans during World War Two (WW2) or the Koreans during the Korean War. These are one-off payments of $25,000 to service personnel and civilians, or their widows or widowers. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04080020-01.html">Exempt Assets</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Restitution Payments</strong> are made by various governments (for example, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands) to victims of Nazi persecution and may be exempt from the income test</li>

<p>The final quarterly DSAP payment was made in April 2008. As these payments are taxable in the financial year in which they are received, the 07/08 payments were assessable until 1 July 2008.</p>

<p>Payments received under DSAP are income for social security purposes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if a customer is still involved in a primary production business, the income is assessed as business income received from primary production. This means that any DSAP amounts received was added to the total of the business' income. The usual deductions under section 1075 of the Social Security Act 1991 was allowed. This applies regardless of the primary production business continues to carry on a dairy enterprise or not</li>
		<li>
if a customer is no longer involved in a primary production business but still receives DSAP payments, the payments are treated as the income of the individual. This means section 1075 of the Social Security Act 1991 deductions do not apply</li>
		<li>
if a customer still receives DSAP payments, and is only involved in a business which is not involved in primary production, the payments are treated as the income of the individual and section 1075 of the Social Security Act 1991 deductions cannot be allowed</li>
		<li>
if payments are classed as income from a primary production business, these amounts could be offset against losses in any necessarily related primary production activities</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the way DSAP payments were treated for social security purposes applies regardless of how the payments may be recorded in income tax returns (that is, if they are recorded as individual income or as income of a primary production entity).</p>

<p>A statutory body usually holds, on behalf of the deceased person's dependants, awards of worker's compensation or damages made after the person's death. Any interest paid on funds held by the statutory body may affect the dependent's entitlement to a pension or benefit.</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, pensions are paid to the surviving partner of a deceased worker by the workers' compensation authority and transport accident authorities. These pensions while compensatory in nature are not regarded as compensation and should be assessed as ordinary unearned income for the recipient.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> payments made in respect of children who were formerly dependant on the deceased are not treated as income. However, they may affect the child income deductions for those children.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> The Dust Diseases Board (DDB) pays a surviving partner ongoing periodic payments. Treat the ongoing periodic payment as ordinary income and record on Other Income Summary (<strong>OINS</strong>) using type '<strong>OTH'</strong> - Other.</p>

<p>Assessment of the income depends on the nature of arrangement in which the income is generated. For assistance with determining if the customer is self-employed or an employee, see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03020000-01.html">Self-employed or employee?</a></p>

<p>Where the customer is self-employed and generates income in a business-like manner with the intention of making a profit, assess the income as self-employment income, allowable deductions may apply. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-03010000-01.html">Assessment of income and assets from business structures for Centrelink payments</a>.</p>

<p>Where the customer is not self-employed, assess the income as <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">employment income</a> for a period equal to the period that the income represents. Where the income is not paid in respect of a particular period, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-01.html">Recording and correcting employment income details</a>. Assess lump sums received as remunerative lump sums, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020020-01.html">Treatment of lump sums</a>.</p>

It is likely that any payments resulting from successful native title claims will be made to communities rather than individuals. When a payment for a successful native title claim is made to a community and used by the community, the payment is not assessed as income. If individual customers receive compensatory amounts, either from the community or the compensation payer, Services Australia Helpdesks should refer the details to the agency's Means Test Policy Section for guidance.</p>

<p>An income stream is a regular series of payments, which may be made for as long as the customer's (or their partner's) life or for a fixed term. The income stream may be purchased with a capital sum or made directly from accumulated superannuation contributions.</p>

<p>The 3 assessment categories of income streams are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
asset-test exempt streams, that ensures a steady draw down of income and capital underlying the income stream</li>
			<ul>			<li>
income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 and before 20 September 2007 that meet the characteristics for assets test exemption will be 50% asset-test exempt. Any asset-test exempt income stream purchased before 20 September 2004 continues to receive a 100% assets test exemption</li>
			<li>
all income streams purchased on or after 20 September 2007 are fully assets tested. <strong>Exceptions&#58;</strong> Defined benefit income streams continue to be 100% asset-test exempt irrespective of start date. In a limited number of circumstances, certain ATE income streams purchased before 20 September 2007 that are commuted and rolled over into post 20 September 2007 ATE income streams are allowed to retain a 100% or 50% asset test exemption (whichever is applicable), provided certain conditions are satisfied</li>		</ul>
		<li>
asset tested income stream (long term), that allow access to capital but are still for a reasonably long term (more than 5 years)</li>
		<li>
asset tested income stream (short term), that allow access to capital and are of short term (5 years or less). These are deemed under the income test</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> both asset-test exempt and assets tested income streams (long term) can have a term of 5 years or less, if the investor's life expectancy is 5 years or less.</p>

<p>Types of income streams include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Account-based pension (Allocated Pension) Annuity</li>
		<li>
Immediate Annuity (lifetime purchased before 1 July 2019, life expectancy or term)</li>
		<li>
Superannuation Pension (non-defined benefit, can be lifetime or life expectancy)</li>
		<li>
Defined Benefit Superannuation Pension (for example, ComSuper pension)</li>
		<li>
Market-linked Pension/Annuity</li>
		<li>
Lifetime pooled income streams</li>
		</ul>
<p>Take care when determining the product type the income stream fits into for coding purposes. The product types on the system are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Account-based income stream</li>
		<li>
Lifetime income stream (purchased before 1 July 2019)</li>
		<li>
Lifetime pooled income stream - non superannuation</li>
		<li>
Lifetime pooled income stream - superannuation</li>
		<li>
Life Expectancy income stream</li>
		<li>
Market-linked income stream</li>
		<li>

<p><strong>Conventional life insurance policies&#58;</strong></p>

<p>These policies are principally 'pure endowment', 'endowment' or 'whole of life'.</p>

<p>Bonuses on conventional life insurance policies are not assessed as ongoing income during the term of the policy. On maturity, however, the difference between the maturity payment and the sum of the purchase price and premiums paid by the investor is assessed as income for 12 months from the date the policy expires.</p>

<p>Record the assessable income on the Other Income (<strong>OIN</strong>) screen using type ‘<strong>OTH</strong>’ - Other. Record with frequency ‘<strong>ANN</strong>’ - Annual to assess for 52 weeks. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020010-01.html">Recording other income on the Other Income (OIN) screen</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Deeming does not apply to conventional life insurance policies, as they do not fall into the definition of financial investments. The surrender value of the life insurance policy is to be assessed under the assets test for the term of the policy.</p>

<p>For coding of assessable assets from conventional life insurance policies, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04010000-01.html">Coding income and assets</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> unbundled life insurance (or a Universal Life Plan) is not treated as conventional life insurance as they are a form of managed investment. For more information, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04090020-01.html">Managed investments - adding a new investment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Whole of life superannuation policies&#58;</strong></p>

<p>Some 'whole of life' life insurance policies are actually superannuation policies offered by the insurance companies, and are therefore subject to the same rules as other superannuation funds, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05000000-03.html#bp03060031_Superannuation">Superannuation</a>. They <strong>are not</strong> the same as whole of life conventional life insurance products, which are asset, tested but not income tested. The policy documents will indicate if the policy is a superannuation policy, for example, MLC Whole of Life Superannuation, AMP Endowment Personal Super Plan.</p>

<p>Being a superannuation fund, it should be coded only if customer is of Age Pension age or over.</p>

<p>The amount coded on Managed Investments (<strong>MI</strong>) or the Unregistered Managed Investments (<strong>MIUS</strong>) is the 'Accumulated Superannuation Benefit' shown on the customer's latest statement of account and <strong>not</strong> the amount payable from the policy in the event of the death of the insured party.</p>

<p><strong>Property settlements&#58;</strong></p>

<p>The capital component of a property settlement is <strong>not</strong> assessed as income if it is received as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a one-time payment</li>
		<li>
regular repayments of the capital component of the property settlement</li>
		</ul>
<p>These payments are repayments of the customer's own property. However, the settlement proceeds may be considered as a financial investment if invested and, therefore, be assessed under current <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05050000-01.html">deeming provision</a> rules.</p>

<p>A property settlement may be received in regular instalments and the order or agreement may provide for interest to be paid on the outstanding balance of the settlement. The interest is assessed as income throughout the period that it accrues.</p>

<p>The outstanding balance of a property settlement is reviewed at the same time as an income review is made. Any interest payable on the outstanding balance is assessed as income throughout the period in which it accrues.</p>

<p>The outstanding balance of a property settlement is an asset. <strong>Example&#58;</strong> A property settlement of $300,000 was awarded to the customer. This is to be paid in instalments of $20,000 pa. The $20,000 pa is exempt income <strong>but</strong> the $300,000 is an assessable asset minus any amount paid, that is, reduced by $20,000 pa.

<p>Generally, scholarships are treated as income or as 'valuable consideration'. This includes scholarships paid directly to a student or to a third party (usually the school) in respect of a student.</p>

<p>Assess the income as an annual amount, with a review coded to take the income off at the end of the period.</p>

<p><strong>Teacher Training Scholarships</strong></p>

<p>If a teacher is undertaking studies, any teacher training scholarship received for them or their partner is assessed as income. Any additional allowance in respect of dependent children, reduces the additional free area for dependent children. Any allowance paid to the student child is the child's own income.</p>

<p><strong>Exemptions from the income test&#58;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Non-discretionary fee-waive or fee-pay scholarships</strong> will not be counted as income under the Social Security Act 1991. This means the value of these scholarships is no longer taken into account when applying the income tests for pensions and allowances, including the Personal income test for Youth Allowance, Austudy and ABSTUDY, or for the primary payment of Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) recipients.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A <strong>fee-waiver scholarship</strong> is one where an education institution reduces or waives part or all the course charge or fee</li>
		<li>
A <strong>fee-pay scholarship</strong> is one provided by an external provider (for example, a business, charity, government department) to pay for tuition fees</li>
		</ul>
<p>Additionally, some scholarships that fully or partially waive or reduce board and/or lodging may be exempt from the income test.</p>

<p>Commonwealth Learning Scholarship is not assessable as income. There are 2 types&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarships</li>
		<li>
Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarships</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Approved scholarships awarded within Australia</strong> are assessed as income however any additional allowance, which is a reimbursement of 'out of pocket' expenses, is not assessable.</p>

<p><strong>Approved scholarships awarded outside Australia</strong> are not assessable as income.</p>

<p>Solar energy feed in tariff rebates occur when a customer with solar power sells energy to the provider. The customer receives a direct payment or credit for the excess energy sold.</p>

<p>Solar feed in tariff payments are assessed as income (for example, they receive a cheque or direct deposit from the energy provider). They are <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020010-01.html">treated as non-remunerative lumps sums</a> and assessed for 52 weeks from the date of receipt on Other Income (<strong>OIN</strong>) screen as type '<strong>OTH</strong>' - Other.

<p>There are no deductions allowed against this income unless the customer is running a business.</p>

<p>The assessment differs in situations where the customer is considered to be running a business. In that case, normal business expenses can reduce the amount of income assessed.</p>

<p>Feed in tariffs are paid as credit amounts or discounts, and the amounts are generally small. These amounts of credit or discounts are <strong>not</strong> assessed as income.</p>

<p>This policy applies from the date of announcement by the Minister, 14 May 2010. Before that the assessment of income included credits or discounts.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2012, eligible South Australian (SA) residents may be able to receive a concession of up to $158 per year on their household energy bills, to help with electricity and gas payments (including LPG bottled gas).</p>

<p>The scheme is administered by the SA government.</p>

<p>The concession will usually be a discount or credit amount on a customer's energy bill. The amount of credit or discount is <strong>not</strong> assessed as income.</p>

<p>South Australian customers living in residential parks may receive a lump sum concession payment (for example, a cheque or direct deposit) to help with household expenses, which includes an amount for energy. If this occurs, the payment is treated as a <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020010-01.html">non-remunerative lump sum</a> and assessed for the applicable period (that is, if paid quarterly, assess over 13 weeks, if paid annually, assess over 52 weeks) from the date of receipt.</p>

<p>This income is coded on Other Income (<strong>OIN</strong>) screen as type '<strong>OTH</strong>' - Other. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020010-01.html">Recording other income on the Other Income (OIN) screen</a> for details with coding.</p>

<p>Normally spousal maintenance from a legally enforceable agreement, is <strong>not</strong> assessed as ordinary income under the income test for income support purposes.

<p>However, in cases where the arrangement to pay spousal maintenance is not documented in a legally enforceable manner, use the gross amount of income to assess the payer's rate of income support. For example, where the only evidence of any arrangement is a verbal agreement or statutory declaration. In these situations, income is coded on the Other Income (<strong>OIN</strong>) screen as type '<strong>OTH</strong>' - Other.

<p>The following information does not relate to income streams for example, pensions from a superannuation fund or annuities. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05000000-03.html#bp03060016_Income_streams">Income streams</a>.</p>

<p>Superannuation is <strong>an investment for a person's retirement</strong>, to provide beneficiaries of the scheme with <strong>financial resources during their retirement years</strong>. Money is accumulated during the person's working life in specialised accounts. Employers also have an obligation to contribute superannuation on behalf of their employees at legislated rates.</p>

<p>Since 20 March 1993, all superannuation and rollover investments for customers of Age Pension age are assessed as income and assets. Superannuation investments are assessed under <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05050000-01.html">deeming rules</a> once the customer reaches Age Pension age and are coded on the Managed Investments (<strong>MIN</strong>) cluster of screens. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04090020-01.html">Managed investments - adding a new investment</a>.</p>

<p>Superannuation in the accumulation phase held by customers under Age Pension age is not assessed under the income test or assets test. Information relating to superannuation is not to be obtained or recorded unless the superannuation owner is within 13 weeks of reaching Age Pension age.</p>

<p>Superannuation investments in the draw down phase, where customers receive ongoing income from a superannuation investment, for example, a pension or annuity is assessed as an income stream regardless of the customer's age. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05060000-01.html">Income streams</a>.</p>

<p>From 28 December 2002, new laws allowed the Family Court, or parties to a property settlement, the power to split superannuation. The laws also gave the Court the power to 'flag' a superannuation interest for future splitting.</p>

<p>Most splits of superannuation in the accumulation phase will involve customers under Age Pension age, and as superannuation in the accumulation phase is exempt for under Age Pension age customers, splits should have no effect on income support entitlements. If superannuation in the accumulation phase is split for customers who are of Age Pension age, update the customer's changed superannuation details in the usual manner. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05070010-01.html">Assessing superannuation</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer receives an amount as part of a super split, the amount will be treated as an exempt lump sum payment, <strong>not</strong> as income. Update the customer's record accordingly if all or part of the amount has been reinvested in assessable assets or other financial investments. For example, deposited in a bank account or used to purchase a vehicle. For help, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04010000-01.html">Coding income and assets for Centrelink payments and services</a>.</p>

<p>Amounts withdrawn under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme are disregarded when calculating a person's taxable income for Services Australia payments, supplements and services. The Australian Taxation Office are responsible for administering the scheme.</p>

<p>Winnings can be obtained by chance (for example, lottery, scratch-it cards, roulette), by skill (for example, professional sportsperson), or a mixture depending on ability (for example, those who gamble on horse races or play cards).</p>

<p><strong>Individual chance winnings</strong> (such as lump sum lottery wins) are <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04080040-01.html">exempt lump sums</a>, regardless of how many times they occur, because they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are unlikely to be repeated (every bet is less likely to win than lose, the frequency of gambling does not change this)</li>
		<li>
cannot be reasonably expected to be received or necessarily anticipated (this is evident where odds are less than 100%), and</li>
		<li>
do not represent receipt of money for services rendered directly or indirectly</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <strong>only exception</strong> is when a prize won by chance is paid periodically, for example, scratch-it cards where regular payments are made, as opposed to a single lump sum, in which case, income is assessed as the amount received each period for the duration of that period. For instance, someone receiving $1,000 on the first day of each month would have $1,000 per month recorded until 1 month after the last payment. For this&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Record the income on the Other Income (<strong>OIN</strong>) screen using type ‘<strong>OTH</strong>’ - Other</li>
		<li>
Use the frequency that the amount is received as the income frequency</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-05020010-01.html">Recording other income on the Other Income (OIN) screen</a> for details with recording income</li>
		</ul>
<p>These periodic chance winnings cannot be reduced by ‘losses’ in the form of previously unsuccessful ticket purchases. This is because these winnings are not the result of a customer using their skill to earn an income through a business structure.</p>

<p><strong>Winnings earned by the skill of a customer undertaking their profession</strong>, for example, a sportsperson or professional gambler (usually declared on tax returns as such) are assessed as income. They may be considered as running a business as a sole trader (or in partnership), in which case an annual rate of income is determined, based on winnings less expenses, which include <strong>verifiable</strong> losses.</p>

<p>Ask customers who frequently gamble on horse races or cards. If they intend to try to use their skill as a major, if not principal, income source. If so, they should be treated as running a business and asked for regular (for example, annual) profit and loss statements. (<strong>Note&#58;</strong> losses are valid expenses only when income is assessed as part of a business structure). A one off win in an area outside of the customer's profession is an exempt lump sum. For example, if a customer who is a professional poker player won $100 for best cake decoration at a show, this is not assessable income.</p>

<p>Regardless if the winnings are assessed as income or not, the resulting assets are assessable under the normal assets test. Deprivation is assessed if the winnings are gifted, and deeming is applied if they are held as financial assets. For example, a customer may frequently play roulette at the casino. Their wins are exempt but they are still obliged to notify any change in cash on hand, bank balances, and other assets.</p>

<p>Inexplicable gambling behaviour may indicate a need to investigate other Means Test issues, for example, gambling on behalf of others for a payment (employment income), or unaccountable losses (previously hidden income or assets).</p>
