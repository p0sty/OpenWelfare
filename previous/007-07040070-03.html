<p>First check that a change of care assessment is appropriate.</p>

<p>Where a change of care has occurred, yet care details (such as start date) have not been provided within the claim, an outbound call attempt should be made to the gaining carer to obtain missing care information.</p>

<p>Where the other carer does not have a current record and/or documentation provided does not include the other carer’s current contact details, request their name, address and telephone number from the notifying carer. <strong>Do not</strong> provide any details to the notifying carer.</p>

<p>If unsuccessful, send a request for information as per <a href="../families/007-07030190-01.html">Information requests for FTB, PPL and DAP claims and Add Newborn activities</a>.</p>

<p>Where the customer does not respond, see <a href="../families/007-07030140-01.html">Not effective, rejection, or withdrawal of claim for Family Tax Benefit or Stillborn Baby Payment</a>. The <a href="../families/007-07040070-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a list of titles for letters and forms.</p>

<p>When care information is received, check the <strong>Care Alignment Details</strong> page. If Child Support have commenced or finalised a care assessment, see <a href="../families/007-02040020-03.html">Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Table 1, Step 8</a>.</p>

<p>If an individual (including a non-customer) wants to apply for a formal review of the care decision affecting their FTB or child support assessment, see <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-05110000-01.html">Review of care decisions</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer wants to apply for a formal review of the care decision affecting their income support payment, a separate formal review should be registered.</p>

<p>Customers may continue to receive payments for a child who is out of their care temporarily for a short period. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050020-01.html">Child leaves customer's care/ custody</a>.</p>

<p>Customers may also continue to receive FTB for up to 14 weeks for a <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050040-01.html">child who has left their care without their consent</a>.</p>

<p>If the new carer is a grandparent, refer to <a href="../families/007-07040110-01.html">Eligibility for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for grandparent carers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when determining if a change of care has occurred (including where all parties agree to the change of care), consider whether further information is needed to determine if the change is a change of care or delegated care. Refer to the <a href="../families/007-07040070-01.html">Background</a> page for additional information.</p>

<p>The previous carer may have already advised that the child has left their care. The gaining carer may provide evidence to confirm the change of care and the date the care changed from.</p>

<p>It is <strong>mandatory</strong> to attempt to contact the losing carer by phone initially, in most cases. <strong>Exceptions</strong> to this are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a change of care has occurred as a result of a <strong>child being removed from their parents care by a state welfare authority</strong> there may be sensitivities involved and staff should exercise their judgement on a case by case basis to determine whether it is appropriate to make contact. Evidence for change of care supplied by the gaining carer can be used to confirm the change of care. However, the delegate must be satisfied based on the available evidence that a change of care has occurred</li>
		<li>
If a change of care has occurred as a result of a <strong>family and domestic violence</strong> situation and there is concern that the customer or children will be placed at risk if the losing carer is contacted, evidence for change of care supplied by the gaining carer can be used to confirm the change of care. However, the delegate must be satisfied based on the available evidence that a change of care has occurred. The <a href="../families/007-07040070-05.html">Resources</a> page has an example</li>
		<li>
If a change of care has occurred because of the <strong>death of the losing carer</strong>, evidence supplied by the gaining carer can be used to confirm the change of care. However, the delegate must be satisfied based on the available evidence a change of care has occurred. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the death has been confirmed, complete updates on the deceased customer’s record before running the <strong>Notification of Death</strong> guided procedure. See <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-04050000-01.html">Death of a family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme customer</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where FDV concerns are identified, the FDV Support model must be followed and consideration be given to the involvement of a <strong>social worker</strong> where a child may be at risk of harm or where a customer's circumstances indicate vulnerability or risk to the customer's safety&#58; See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12010000-01.html">Social work service referral</a>. </p>

<p>If staff need any assistance, they need to follow the standard escalation procedures, see <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-23051044-01.html">Tier 0 technical support - self-sufficiency</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Does an exception apply as above?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes, do not attempt </strong>to verify care arrangements with the child or any other non-parent person or organisation. The exception is in some cases it may be necessary to contact a state welfare authority or foster care agency to obtain additional information about the child, <a href="../families/007-07040070-03.html#bp03_tbl_Confirming_change_of_Step03">go to Step 3</a></li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> due to the unsuccessful contact with the losing carer, letters are sent to both the losing and gaining carer now as this gives both carers equal opportunity to provide evidence for change of care without unnecessary delays to process the FTB payment.</p>

<p><strong>Customer in hardship&#58;</strong> If the new carer is in hardship <strong>and</strong> claiming or receiving an income support payment, the claim may be determined without delay. However, the change of care must still be confirmed, this can be by phone. If contact cannot be made and the evidence for change of care to support the decision is satisfactory, FTB can be paid to the gaining carer. The customer should be advised that if the care arrangements are contested, this may result in an overpayment for the customer.</p>

<p>From 10 June 2019, FTB top-ups, supplements, lump sum claim amounts and instalment arrears can be used to recover any family assistance, social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts.

Cancel the FTB for the <strong>losing carer</strong>, reason '<strong>FRC</strong> ' (Failed to Reply to Correspondence) on the Benefits Action (<strong>BA</strong>) screen from date paid to plus 1. If the <strong>losing carer</strong> is vulnerable or at risk, 2 genuine attempts to contact should be made before cancelling FTB</li>

			<li>
If the <strong>gaining carer</strong> is <strong>not FTB current</strong>, the claim needs to be made '<strong>NEF</strong> ' (not effective), as it is not certain that the change of care has occurred. FTB should not be granted to the new carer. Do not change the care percentages until there is enough evidence to support such a decision.

Further evidence for change of care may need to be requested from the gaining carer.

Do not grant the gaining carer until there is enough evidence to support the decision. Procedure ends here</li>

Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong> on each carer's record. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the actual care decision is made, both gaining and losing carer records should be updated with the correct care details from the correct date.

<p>When assessing levels of 'care', consider the full circumstances of the case to decide who has 'care' of the child during the contested period.</p>

<p>On the strength of the information provided, determine who has care of the child, and when the change of care took place.</p>

<p>If a review of decision is needed, the program that determined the care assessment will usually conduct the review and update the status (Commenced or Finalised) on the <strong>Care Alignment Details</strong> page.</p>

<p>If there is disagreement over the care arrangements, obtain the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date from which the child/ren started to live with the new carer</li>
		<li>
what the new arrangements were intended to be at the time of the change (temporary or viewed as being permanent)</li>
		<li>
when it was decided that the child would not return to the previous carer</li>
		<li>
when the losing carer became aware of the decision</li>		</ul>
