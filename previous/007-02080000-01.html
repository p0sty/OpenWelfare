	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>An <strong>absence is considered to be temporary</strong> if the customer continues to reside in Australia. A customer leaving Australia temporarily will generally continue to be entitled to Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Child Care Subsidy (CCS), and Paid Parental Leave scheme payments for up to the maximum portability period, from the original date of departure from Australia, provided they are not return rule affected.</p>

<p><strong>For original date of departure&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB (both Part A and Part B) can generally continue for up to 6 weeks of a temporary absence of the customer and/or their child. At the end of this period FTB will cancel</li>
		<li>
CCS can generally continue if entitlement exists for the first 6 weeks of an absence for the customer. At the end of this period CCS entitlement will decrease to a zero rate</li>
		<li>
Paid Parental Leave (PPL)/ Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) can generally be paid for Australian residents if entitlement exists for up to 56 weeks of a temporary absence</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some customers can only be paid under approved absence rules. See <a href="../families/007-02080000-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Approved_absenc">Approved absences for certain temporary visa holders</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer or child is unable to return at the end of their maximum portability period, Services Australia has the <a href="../australians-overseas/061-01050000-01.html">discretion to extend the period of portability</a> under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>There is usually no entitlement to CCS for the absence of the child from child care as the care must be provided in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the child has 14 continuous weeks of non-attendance at child care, their enrolment automatically ceases and payment may be recovered from the customer. See <a href="../families/007-17103117-01.html">Enrolment requirements for Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If a customer is receiving PPL or DAP</strong> while they are overseas, their&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
PPL period will cancel when their absence exceeds 56 weeks, even if they have not received the maximum amount</li>
		<li>
DAP will cancel when their absence exceeds 56 weeks, even if they have not received the maximum DAP period</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the 56 week portability period starts from the date the customer leaves the country regardless of whether they have a child in their care or are in receipt of family assistance or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments at that time. Return rules can impact the start date of the 56 week period. The <a href="../families/007-02080000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a table providing information about FTB portability periods and the effects on FTB rates and PPL rules.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>A person or child who is absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks, who returns to Australia and leaves Australia again less than 6 weeks later, is deemed not to have returned to Australia.</p>

<p>If a customer or their child leaves Australia temporarily within 6 weeks of their last return to Australia and the previous absence was longer than 6 weeks, their FTB is cancelled as soon as they leave Australia again. If the customer leaves Australia temporarily within 6 weeks of their last return to Australia and the previous absence was longer than 6 weeks, their CCS entitlement will decrease to a zero rate.</p>

<p>These return rules do not impact the customer's entitlement to FTB and/or CCS while they, or their child/ren, are physically in Australia between overseas trips.</p>

<p>Multiple trips can be an indication that the customer and or child is no longer residing in Australia. A customer is no longer eligible for FTB, CCS, PPL or DAP if they cease to reside in Australia.</p>

<p>There have been a number of changes to these return rules since FTB inception on 1 July 2000.</p>

<p>The Department of Defence may cover any entitlements lost by defence force personnel and their families due to overseas absences/postings.</p>

<p>These customers may request a letter stating when their entitlement ceases (and the date from which the FTB reduction in rate occurred). The letter will enable the relevant Department of Defence HR department to calculate the shortfall and pay any lost entitlement if applicable.

<p>The Department of Home Affairs will generally advise Services Australia when a Centrelink customer leaves or returns to Australia. When Department of Home Affairs advise of departure/return information, the portability of the payment is automatically assessed by the system, regardless of whether the customer notified or not. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Department of Home Affairs datalink activities should not be cancelled.</p>

<p>Services Australia uses the date of departure or arrival provided by the Department of Home Affairs. If adversely affected, the customer can provide evidence of alternative dates. Staff should consider applying the alternative dates if it is reasonable and results in a beneficial outcome for the customer.</p>

<p>In many cases, customers do <strong>not</strong> need to advise when they are leaving Australia temporarily, or have returned from a temporary absence.</p>

<p>However, there are situations where customers should advise of a departure prior to leaving Australia or contact when they have returned to Australia.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> In most cases, customers can notify of their departure from Australia via the <a href="../self-service/133-04150030-01.html">Travelling outside of Australia service</a> within their Centrelink online account. Where a customer's circumstances are more complex they will be prompted to contact the agency.</p>

<p>The day a customer returns to Australia is not included as part of their absence as they are considered to be inside Australia on that day regardless of the time of return and no longer affected by portability.
