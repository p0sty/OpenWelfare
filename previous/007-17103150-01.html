proof of enrolment in a course of study or education</li>

<p>Customers have 28 days from the date they apply for ACCS (Transition to Work) to enter into a Job Plan or Participation Plan (if required). They are required to contact the agency or an Employment Service Provider (if they have one) and request to negotiate a Job Plan for the purposes of ACCS (Transition to Work). Job Plans can be negotiated without a face to face interview.</p>

<p>Customers receiving Disability Support Pension (DSP) must negotiate a DSP Participation Plan to meet requirements for ACCS (Transition to Work). If a DSP customer does not have mandatory participation requirements, they will need to enter into a <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090060-01.html">Voluntary DSP Participation Plan</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Job Plans do not meet ACCS (Transition to Work) requirements for DSP customers.</p>

<p>As ParentsNext participants are provider managed, ParentsNext Participation Plans are developed and updated by ParentsNext providers only. Service Officers are only able to view ParentsNext Participation Plans. They cannot negotiate or update them. If a parent wishes to update their Participation Plan for the purposes of ACCS (Transition to Work), they will need to be referred to their ParentsNext provider.</p>

<p>Payment for ACCS (Transition to Work) can only be made once all eligibility criteria are met including having an active Job Plan or Participation Plan. If the Job Plan is not active, payments cannot be made until the Monday of the CCS fortnight after the Job Plan is active. The date of effect of ACCS (Transition to Work) will be the Monday of the CCS fortnight, ACCS (Transition to Work) will not be backdated prior to this date.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to enter into a Job Plan within 28 days of applying for ACCS (Transition to Work), their application will be made not effective and considered to have not been made. If a customer enters into a Job Plan more than 28 days after date of lodgement of their application, even if the application has not been processed, the application will be Not Effective. The customer will need to lodge a new application.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>For all activities where Job Plan requirements have been met, the earliest start date for a period of ACCS (Transition to Work) is from the date of application, where the date of lodgement is the first Monday of a CCS fortnight. If the application is lodged mid-week, the start date is the first Monday of the next CCS fortnight.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> due to Policy clarification for ACCS (Transition to Work), applications assessed before 13 June 2022 where a customer commenced or increased their hours for paid work the date of effect was the first Monday of the CCS fortnight before the fortnight in which the change occurred. This DOE was subject to the customer notifying as soon as possible when they started or increased their hours of paid work. The <a href="../families/007-17103150-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Examples">Resources</a> page contains examples of how to assess the start date for paid work activities.</p>

<p>When Job Plan requirements have not been met at the time of application&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
but the customer enters into a Job Plan/Participation Plan within 28 days of lodging their application</li>
		<li>
the earliest start date for ACCS (Transition to Work) is the first Monday of the CCS fortnight after Job Plan requirements have been met</li>
		<li>
ACCS (Transition to Work) cannot be backdated to the date that would have applied had the customer had an active Job Plan at lodgement</li>
		</ul>
<p>If further information is required to process an ACCS (Transition to Work) application, customers will be asked to provide the information within 14 days. If the information <strong>is not</strong> supplied, the application will be not effective and considered not to have been made. The customer will be required to make a new application for ACCS (Transition to Work). There are no backdating provisions for this subsidy.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the application was combined with a CCS claim, the CCS component of the claim will be assessed and the customer notified of the outcome.</p>

<p>If a customer nominates a start date for ACCS (Transition to Work), but no sessions of care occur in that CCS fortnight, the start date can be changed to the CCS fortnight in which the first session of care will occur.</p>

an increase in family income estimate</li>
		<li>
expiry of an active job plan, or</li>
		<li>
no longer meeting the ACCS (Transition to Work) activity requirements</li>

<p>If the change of circumstances entitles the customer to another type of ACCS payment, entitlement to ACCS (Transition to Work) will cease.
