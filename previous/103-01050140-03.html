<p>If a customer's income support payment is suspended, their IM participation will continue until the payment is restored. If the income support payment is subsequently cancelled, the customer's IM participation will automatically end.</p>

<p>Take the following action when the customer enters prison and their income support payments are, or will be, suspended&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Priority needs&#58;</strong> if the customer's IM account has a credit balance, these funds will be available to them for their priority needs. It is highly likely that incarceration will change the customer's priority needs. Consider customers who may be supporting their family members by using their income managed funds whilst they are in prison </li>
		<li>
I<strong>M expenses&#58; </strong>a customer's IM expenses can be stopped when they are admitted to prison, until the customer can be contacted. This should happen immediately where the priority need is no longer relevant (for example, regular allocation to a BasicsCard), until discussions can be held with the customer. If no action is taken to end the customer’s IM expenses, they will continue to be paid until their income managed funds are exhausted, or the customer’s IM participation ends. Where IM expenses continue to be paid, recovery of funds may be needed following discussions with the customer</li>
			<ul>			<li>
For more information see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01050070-01.html">Recall of Income Management funds from a Third Party Organisation (TPO)</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>BasicsCard&#58;</strong> if the customer will be incarcerated for less than 13 weeks, suspend the BasicsCard upon the customer’s entry to prison to avoid unauthorised use of the card. If the customer's income support payment is subsequently restored, the BasicsCard can be reactivated for immediate use by the customer </li>
		<li>
<strong>Arrears payments&#58;</strong> if a customer is paid an arrears payment, 100% of the payment will be income managed. An <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01050120-01.html">Unrestricted Cash payment (UCP)</a> may be payable if the customer asks</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment Nominee&#58;</strong> customers may choose to appoint a payment nominee during their period of incarceration. If appointed, the payment nominee will be responsible for managing a customer's IM funds. </li>
			<ul>			<li>
For more information see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01010020-01.html">Nominee arrangements under Income Management</a></li>

<p>If a customer's income support payment is cancelled, the customer’s IM participation will automatically end. Customers are notified in writing of the end of their IM participation, and invited to contact Services Australia to discuss how they would like any of their remaining IM funds to be paid.</p>

<p>The following will happen when a customer's IM participation ends, when the customer enters prison&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>IM expenses&#58;</strong> IM expenses will continue to be paid for 14 days. If the customer's income support payment is not likely to be restored within 14 days, regular expenses should be ended when notification is received that the customer has entered prison. </li>
		<li>
<strong>BasicsCard&#58;</strong> given that the customer will not be able to use their BasicsCard whilst in prison, the card should be closed upon the customer’s entry to prison to avoid unauthorised use of the card. </li>
		<li>
<strong>Disbursement of residual funds&#58;</strong> incarcerated customers are unable to attend disbursement interviews. When a customer’s IM participation automatically ends, any remaining IM funds will be disbursed under the Auto Disbursement rules. Funds are paid to the customer's last known payment destination. It is important that the payment destination details are correct for Service Reason '<strong>GPY</strong>.'</li>
		<li>
<strong>Payment Nominee&#58; </strong>customers may choose to appoint a payment nominee during their period of incarceration. If appointed, any residual funds will be paid to the payment nominee's nominated bank account. For more information, see <a href="../payment-delivery/103-01010020-01.html">Nominee arrangements under Income Management</a>. </li>
