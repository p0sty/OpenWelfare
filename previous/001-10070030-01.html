	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants who are receiving a participation payment are required to enter into, or renegotiate, a Job/Participation Plan when notified of a requirement to do so.</p>

<p>Providers have responsibility for negotiating Job/Participation Plans that set out the compulsory requirements a job seeker must comply with in return for receiving a participation payment. When setting requirements, the provider must ensure that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker's personal circumstances and assessed capacity have been considered and requirements are ones that the job seeker is capable of meeting, and</li>
		<li>
compulsory requirements are <a href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-01.html">consistent with relevant legislation and policies and do not exceed prescribed maximum limits set out in social security law</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers are entitled to 'think time' if they have concerns about the Job/Participation Plan, or express the need for further time to think about the terms of a plan prior to entering into it (for example, concerns about their ability to meet the terms).</p>

<p>Job seekers in Workforce Australia online can discuss the requirements in their Job Plan with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' Digital Services Contact Centre if they wish to before accepting their plan.</p>

<p>Think time does not apply where there is no intention to enter into a Job/Participation Plan (such as, where the person is refusing to enter into a Job/Participation Plan).</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Where the job seeker refuses to enter into, or renegotiate a Job/Participation Plan, including unreasonably delaying entering into a Job/Participation Plan, providers may initiate compliance action. The appropriate job seeker compliance system will be used to re-engage the job seeker.</p>

<p>Where the job seeker refuses to enter into or renegotiate a Job/Participation Plan, cancellation of payments can be considered.</p>

<p>For job seekers managed by Services Australia or connected to Workforce Australia Online, participation payments are not payable until they enter into a Job Plan.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, where a provider managed job seeker refuses to enter or renegotiate a Job/Participation Plan, a mutual obligation failure has been committed.</p>

<p>When providers report the mutual obligation failure to Services Australia, the job seeker's participation payments are automatically suspended. The Services Australia system lifts the payment suspension when the provider notifies the conditions for lifting the payment suspension have been met.</p>

<p>Job seekers in the warning zone will accrue one demerit if the provider is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason for refusing to enter or renegotiate a Job/Participation Plan.</p>

<p>Job seekers in the financial penalty zone will incur a financial penalty unless&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker satisfies their provider that they had a reasonable excuse for not entering into the Job/Participation Plan and the provider closes the Non-Compliance Report</li>
		<li>
the job seeker satisfies Services Australia during a compliance investigation that they had reasonable excuse for not entering into the Job/Participation Plan. Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers are responsible for conducting these compliance investigations</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Upon receipt of the Participation Report submitted by the Community Development Program (CDP) provider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a connection failure for 'Failure to enter into a Job Plan' will be generated, and</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker will be sent a notification advising them to contact the Participation Solutions Team (PST) as soon as possible to discuss the non-compliance event</li>
		</ul>
<p>A PST skilled Service Officer will investigate the compliance action and where the CDP job seeker does not provide a reasonable excuse for failing to enter into a Job Plan, a connection failure will be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance investigation</strong></p>

<p>In the first instance compliance action will involve the investigation of a failure for not entering into a Job Plan. During the investigation the CDP job seeker will be advised to attend a re-engagement appointment and enter into a Job Plan. If the failure is applied and the CDP job seeker again refuses to enter into a Job Plan (the second consecutive refusal) then an ongoing failure to meet a condition of their payment has been established and their payment should be <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10020010-01.html">manually cancelled</a>, recording the cancellation reason/code 'Failed to sign Job Plan' (FSA). A second refusal to enter into a Job Plan may occur immediately or sometime after the restated requirement when&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the failure is applied (for the first refusal) and the CDP job seeker again refuses to accept the requirement to enter into a Job Plan (for instance, they have either stated they will, or will not, attend the appointment but are not prepared to enter a Job Plan). As the second refusal has clearly been established by the CDP job seeker's statement their payment should be cancelled from the date of the second refusal</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker attends the re-engagement appointment but refuses to enter into a Job Plan when asked to do so, and a connection failure is subsequently generated and investigated for failing to enter into a Job Plan. Where it is determined that the CDP job seeker does not have a good reason for refusing to sign the Job Plan, the CDP job seeker's payment should be cancelled from the date of the second consecutive refusal</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker does not attend the re-engagement appointment and during the subsequent failure investigation the CDP job seeker indicates their reason for not attending the appointment is to avoid entering into a Job Plan. Again, payment should be cancelled from the date of the second consecutive refusal to sign the Job Plan</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Ongoing refusal to enter into a Job Plan</strong></p>

<p>The first and second refusal do not need to be consecutive failures (and nor does a second failure need to be applied) however the two events must represent an ongoing refusal to enter into a Job Plan before cancellation of payment can be considered.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Cancellation_of">Cancellation of income support payment</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When an income support payment is cancelled for failing to enter into a Job Plan the CDP job seeker has lost qualification for the payment. This means payment <strong>cannot</strong> be restored. If the CDP job seeker wishes to be paid again they will need to lodge another claim and retest their qualification.</p>

<p>If a 'Failed to sign Job Plan' (FSA) cancellation is recorded part way through an entitlement period the CDP job seeker may be able to receive payment up to (but not including) the date of cancellation. If a Reporting Statement (SU19) is not lodged for this period then payment may cancel 'Did not lodge' (DNL) or 'Failed to report' (FRP) which will result in the system removing the FSA cancellation reason from the CDP job seeker's record. The removal of the FSA cancellation reason does not alter the decision to cancel payment due to an ongoing refusal to enter into a Job Plan and the CDP job seeker is still required to lodge another claim if they want to recommence payment. To ensure the correct action is taken following an FSA cancellation a Display on Access <strong>DOC</strong> should be created on the CDP job seeker's record with an expiry date 13 weeks in the future. The Display on Access <strong>DOC</strong> should include the reason for cancellation, date of decision and the action to be taken if the CDP job seeker wants to receive a participation payment again.</p>
