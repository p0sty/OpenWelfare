<p>When an agreement is received by the Agreements Team during the COA process, the Agreements Service Officer notifies the relevant DM by pending the registration, initiating phone contact and routing an <strong>Agreement in Progress</strong> intray to the DM.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if an agreement is received without a pended registration, refer the agreement to the Agreements Team to be recorded, see <a target="_blank" href="../utils/CustomerReferralGuidelines/Customer-Referral-Guidelines.html?agreement-court-order-received-or-variation.html">Customer referral guidelines for Child Support staff</a>. </p>

<p>The Agreements team is required to accept valid child support agreements that are made before or at the same time a COA application is lodged, unless the customer who applied for acceptance of the agreement withdraws their agreement application.</p>

<p>Contact the customer who lodged the agreement to determine if they would prefer the agreement be considered through the COA process, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If customer wants the agreement to be considered through the COA process, they will need to&#58;</li>

<p>Explain&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a decision will be made in relation to the agreement and PNA for FTB purposes, and the likely outcome of the agreement decision</li>
		<li>
once an agreement (other than a binding lump sum agreement) is accepted, a notional assessment (NA) must be made. The NA will be used to calculate FTB Part A, if eligible to receive this payment. There will be a delay between when an agreement is accepted and when the NA issues, during this period FTB is based on the amount of the agreement</li>
		<li>
if the agreement is accepted during the COA process, the initial COA application is taken to be against the PNA that will generate when the agreement is loaded onto Cuba</li>
		<li>
both parties will receive a notice of decision (NTD) in relation to the PNA however their child support will still be assessed as per the Child Support agreement</li>
		<li>
the COA decision will remain in place on the NA until a new PNA is issued, and</li>
		<li>
any potential effects on their FTB as a result of the NA as varied by the COA decision</li>

<p>When determining the duration of the COA decision consider&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customers' current circumstances and the circumstances of the case, and whether or not they are likely to continue. For example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
stable employment/income</li>
			<li>
finalised property settlement and the effect on each customer's financial position</li>
			<li>
stable post separation circumstances and expenses</li>
			<li>
an entitlement to have earnt income following separation excluded from the assessment, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07100000-01.html">Post separation income for Child Support customers</a></li>
			<li>
are actively seeking employment,, or will be required to due to Centrelink eligibility requirements</li>		</ul>
		<li>
the history of the case, for example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
repeat COA applications have been lodged</li>
			<li>
further applications are likely</li>		</ul>
		<li>
whether the administrative assessment will accurately reflect the customers' circumstances</li>
		<li>
any administrative options that might be available</li>
		<li>
the variation to the assessment</li>
		<li>
separate components of the COA decision if multiple or competing reasons have been established</li>
		<li>
if the applicant is a non-parent carer, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-03120040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Record_and_proc_Step05">Step 5 in Record the decision</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Consider longer term decisions when the customers' circumstances are relatively stable. DMs should also seek to make longer term decisions with a high level of flexibility, for example, setting an adjusted taxable income amount. By setting an adjusted taxable income amount for either customer, simple administrative changes to the assessment, during the period of the COA decision, may be possible such as a change in levels of care.</p>

the likelihood of a change in care</li>
		<li>
changes in either parent’s relevant dependent child(ren) arrangements</li>

<p>Where possible, ensure COA decisions allow for future changes in circumstances to be reflected without requiring customers to make further COA applications. Consider the effect a longer term decision will have on the customers' options for simple amendments to the assessment. </p>

<p>Consider the attitude and behaviour of the customers. If a customer has demonstrated an intention to undermine the assessment, it may be appropriate to consider a longer term decision.

repeat COA applications would potentially damage the customers’ relationship</li>

there are family and domestic violence issues, if so a longer term decision may prevent unnecessary tension</li>

<p>An application may be refused for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Too complex - Section 98E</strong></p>

<p>A COA application can be refused where the case or issues raised are too complex. Decisions to refuse the COA application due to being too complex, requires the approval of an EL1 DM Team Leader. The EL1 DM Team Leader must document their confirmation on the COA Maintenance notepad before the decision is processed.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Open the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/NoticeOfDecision.html">Change of Assessment (COA) NTD template</a> macro where it states the following&#58;</li>
		<li>
The application to change the child support assessment is refused because the matters that have been raised are too complex</li>
		</ul>
<p>An applicant can object to the section 98E refusal decision ('too complex' finding). Prior to 1 July 2015 if the objection was disallowed, the customer could apply straight to court for a departure from their assessment. From 1 July 2015, a person may apply to the AAT for a first review of the decision where the matter has been determined by Objections as being too complex.</p>

<p><strong>No reason exists or it is not ‘just and equitable’ and ‘otherwise proper’ - Section 98F and 98L</strong></p>

<p>A COA application can be refused if the customer or DM has not established a reason to change the assessment or it would not be just and equitable and otherwise proper to change the assessment.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Detail the reasons in the NTD</li>
		</ul>
<p>Examples include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the availability of administrative remedies</li>
		<li>
normal formula assessment already makes allowances for the issues raised in the COA application</li>
		<li>
an AAT first review (or SSAT prior to 1 July 2015) decision or court order already addresses the COA issues and there has been no significant change in the customer's circumstances since that decision</li>
		</ul>
<p><a href="../separated-parents/277-03120040-04.html">References</a> has links to the Child Support Guide 2.6.2, What are the reasons for a change of assessment? and Child Support Guide 2.6.17, Would a change be just and equitable?</p>

<p><strong>Previous refusal and no new matter raised – subsection 98J(2)</strong></p>

<p>A COA application can be refused if the customer has not raised any new matter in a subsequent application that distinguishes it from a previous application that was refused.</p>

<p><strong>CTP recommendations – subsections 98L(1) and 98R</strong></p>

<p>A CTP recommendation can be refused if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
it is not found that the level of financial support provided by the customer for the child is unjust and inequitable because of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either customer</li>
		<li>
it would not be just and equitable and otherwise proper to make a change</li>
		</ul>
<p>Under subsection 98R, refuse to make a change to the child support assessment because the issues are too complex. Consider all the relevant information provided by the customers and the information available.</p>

an explanation of how any potential variations in costs, fees, income or circumstances have been considered</li>
		<li>
the calculations made to arrive at the amount payable, after considering income/expenses of the customer</li>

		<li>
include any irrelevant information</li>

<p>A detailed NTD assists the customer to fully understand the COA decision. In the event the customer wishes to exercise their right to object to the decision, a well-documented decision enables a customer to identify any elements they disagree with whether that is a fact relied on or a perceived error in applying the law or policy. Clear and concise decisions also reduce the number of post decision disputes.</p>

<p>In some situations a finalised NTD can be corrected by using the Registrar’s power to review and alter decisions of delegates. In all such cases however, the original DM cannot amend the NTD, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>.</p>

<p>Use the review and alter powers to only correct an obvious error or mistake in a decision. In all other circumstances, an objection is usually the best option. Examples of errors which can be corrected using the Registrar’s review and alter powers&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
In their reasons for decision, the DM indicates the decision will end on 30 December 2017, however, in the final decision they incorrectly state the end date to be 30 December 2018</li>
		<li>
A critical word in a sentence is incorrect, for example ‘Prescribed NAPs can be claimed’ to ‘Prescribed NAPs cannot be claimed</li>
		<li>
In their reasons for decision, the DM indicates they do not wish to create arrears or overpayment, however, arrears or overpayment is created when the decision is implemented</li>
		</ul>
<p>An example of when <strong>not</strong> to use the review and alter powers is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
DM determines that the correct outcome in the circumstances of the case is for a payee’s income to be set to $40,000 and have stated that this is an appropriate rate so as not to cause an overpayment. The DM makes a typographical error in their decision by stating the payee’s income is to be set at $30,000. Correcting this error and setting the payee’s income at $40,000 will cause an overpayment. Review and alter should not be used to amend this decision as it is not as simple as correcting an error or mistake</li>

<p>When an error can be corrected using the Registrar’s review and alter powers, the DM must&#58;</p>

contact all parties to advise that an error has been detected and the agency is considering whether it can be corrected outside of the formal objection or appeals process, and</li>
		<li>
confirm that all the circumstances and evidence remain unchanged since the original decision was made. If circumstances have changed or the customers have further evidence that was not considered in the original decision, an objection would be the best option</li>
		</ul>
<p>If there is no new evidence or new circumstances, the DM can make a recommendation to change the decision and that this change would be just, equitable and otherwise proper using the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/elements/macros/CorrectingErrors.html">correcting errors submission</a> macro. The DM should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
draft an amended NTD, using the original decision and making the necessary changes</li>
		<li>
submit the recommendation and draft NTD to COA and Part 6A Programme Support Manager (PSM) for review</li>
			<ul>			<li>
if the PSM supports the recommendation, they should forward this to Policy Advice</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the DM must not advise the customers that the NTD will be amended, or issue the amended NTD to the customers until approval is received from Program Advice. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>.</p>

<p>If an error is corrected using the Registrar’s review and alter powers, the customers’ objection rights start from when they receive the amended NTD.</p>

<p>Once an error is corrected, issue and process an amended NTD in the Finalisation window.</p>

<p>If a decision is flawed to the extent that it is unreasonable for the customer to proceed to objection or court it is likely that the decision is invalid. For example, the wrong law was applied or there was a denial of procedural fairness or a material piece of evidence was overlooked. Refer to <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a> for more information regarding invalid decisions.</p>

<p>Ensure the customer understands that disclosure of all relevant facts disclosed in the NTD does not constitute a privacy breach. </p>
