<p>Answer&#58; DAP is counted as ordinary income for calculating the rate of income support payments (ISP).</p>

<p>This means if the customer (and/or their partners) receive an ISP, the ISP rate will reduce during the DAP entitlement period.</p>

<p>If the ISP reduces to a zero rate due to DAP, the ISP will cancel. The customer must lodge a new claim if they wish to re test their eligibility for an ISP.</p>

<p>If the DAP nominated start date is backdated to a date that falls within a period for which an ISP has already been paid to the customer (and/or their partner), an ISP overpayment will be raised.</p></td>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can a DAP customer access Flexible PPL days?</strong></p>

<p>For children that are born on or after 1 July 2020, Parental Leave Pay (PPL) includes 30 Flexible PPL days. Primary claimants can give permission for another person (such as their partner or the child’s other parent) to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>If permission has been given for a secondary claimant to claim Flexible PPL, once the secondary claimant reaches the maximum 18 week limit of combined DAP and PPL, any Flexible PPL days they claim will be rejected (reason code&#58; ‘DXP’). </p>

<p>To return these Flexible PPL days to primary claimant, the primary claimant must to remove the permission for another person to claim. These days will be returned to the primary claimant’s unclaimed Flexible PPL balance.

<p><strong>Unexpected emergency</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unwell and unable to care for child</strong></p>

<p>Dara and Lisa recently adopted baby Grace. Dara is the primary carer for Grace as Lisa is working full time. Lisa has arranged to take 2 weeks unpaid leave commencing 15 January 2019 and has claimed DAP for this period.</p>

<p>Due to Lisa becoming unwell during the DAP period, Lisa is unable to care for Grace for a period of 3 days. Lisa is concerned that not providing care for Grace, there may be no eligibility for DAP for this period.</p>

<p>Outcome&#58; Lisa must be advised that although not physically caring for baby Grace, eligibility continues for DAP for this period, as Lisa is residing with Grace and would maintain a level of care, control and oversight even whilst unwell.</p></td>

<p>Jason lodged a pre claim for DAP and nominated the expected date of birth of the child as the DAP period start date.</p>

<p>Jason's wife Alison gave birth to baby Piper 6 weeks early and as a result Piper remained in hospital in the special care nursery for the first 3 weeks after birth. Jason contacts as unsure whether there is still eligibility for DAP while Piper remains in hospital.</p>

still deemed to be caring for the child, and</li>

will remain entitled to DAP</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Individual adjusted taxable income</strong></p>

<p>To meet the DAP income test the customer must have an individual adjusted taxable income (ATI) below the relevant financial year income limit. Evidence is required if the customer's adjusted taxable income is $135,000 and the relevant financial year income limit.</p>

<p>The income limit is indexed annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer has previously met the income test for a Parental Leave Pay (PPL) claim and is now claiming DAP, the customer will automatically meet the income test for DAP.</p>

<p>If the customer claims DAP for the same child as the previous PPL claim, the income test will only be assessed based on the eligibility of the PPL if the customer has failed the income test based on the DAP claim.</p></td>

<p><strong>Evidence to support the DAP income test</strong></p>

<p>Evidence for the DAP is required if the customer's adjusted taxable income is between $135,000 and the relevant financial year income limit.</p>

<p>The following are examples of suitable documents to verify&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
taxable income&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
actual adjusted taxable income details transferred electronically from the ATO to Centrelink</li>
			<li>
payment summaries</li>
			<li>
payslips with year to date amounts if their income tax assessment is not available due to timing</li>
			<li>
a letter from their accountant</li>
			<li>
advice from their employer with sufficient documentary evidence supplied</li>
			<li>
bank statements showing interest earned</li>		</ul>
		<li>
other income&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
evidence of rental property income and expenditure</li>
			<li>
evidence of foreign income or tax exempt foreign income</li>
			<li>
a letter from employer in relation to salary sacrifice amounts and reportable fringe benefits</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Original documents are not required. The customer can fax or post copies of their evidence to family assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer indicates on their online claim they have other income components, for example foreign income, negatively geared investments, net rental property losses etc. then a tax notice of assessment (NOA) issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will not be sufficient as evidence. The customer will need to provide additional evidence such as their full income tax return (ITR).</p></td>

<p><strong>Care of a child for DAP purposes</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for DAP, the customer must be caring for the child on each day of the DAP period, although more than 1 person may be caring for the same child on a particular day.</p>

<p>The customer may be the primary carer of the child or providing care for the child at the same time as another person (for example, the child's birth mother) who is providing primary care for the child.</p>

<p>To be considered as having 'care of the child' for DAP, the customer does not need to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
be living with the child (although generally would be)</li>
		<li>
have any particular percentage of care, or</li>
		<li>
have legal responsibility for the child</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer does not have care of the child on their nominated DAP period start date they will not be eligible for DAP. If they do not have care of the child on another day during their DAP period they will not be eligible from that day onwards.</p>

<p>In the case of child bereavement, the customer may remain eligible for DAP despite not having care of the child on 1 or more days in the DAP period.</p>

<p>If a customer has circumstances that have arisen beyond their control which impact on their care arrangement, they should not be considered ineligible for DAP, for example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer becomes sick in the DAP period</li>
		<li>
the customer has to leave their residence to visit someone due to an unexpected emergency, for example, a family member/friend being hospitalised</li>
		<li>
their baby is born prematurely and remains in hospital for special care or has to go back into hospital for care, or</li>
		<li>
the DAP customer is refused access to the baby/child by the other carer</li>		</ul></td>
