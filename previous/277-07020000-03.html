<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>An ATO issued income is the income tax assessment, for a relevant year of income (RYI), to which their income components are added to make up a parent’s ATI. An ATO used income also sometimes referred to as a taxable income. (Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 s56 (1)).</p>

<p>An ATO issued income is the most reliable income information for use in child support assessments.</p>

<p>If an ATO issued income is used in the assessment you are no longer permitted to determine a provisional income for that year of income.</p>

<p>If the customer is disputing the accuracy of the ATO issued income see Change in income circumstances, including ATO amended incomes</p>

<p><strong>Change in income circumstances, including ATO amended incomes</strong></p>

<p>A customer's financial circumstances may have changed since the relevant year of income (LRY), or since their last issued taxable income.</p>

<p>The following circumstances may apply to the customer, which may result in a change to their income&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an ATO amended income is received due to tax evasion or fraud. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Obtain_an_ATO_i_Step02">Step 2 of Table 3</a></li>

lodged an income tax return for the year prior to the last relevant year. (Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 subsection 58AA)</li>

<p>A deemed income is also known as a provisional income.</p>

<p>The inflation factor used to calculate a deemed income is the percentage figure for the 'All Employees Average Weekly Total Earnings' amount for the September quarter of the last calendar year, ending before the child support period commenced. Cuba automatically applies the inflation factor to the income.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>A default 2/3 MTAWE income is applied when a parent has failed to lodge a tax return for the last two relevant years, and no other information about their income is available. (Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 s58(3)).</p>

<p>Cuba automatically applies a statistical default income (2/3 MTAWE) when there is no other income information recorded in Cuba for the LRYI.</p>

<p>A default income is also known as a provisional income, and is the least preferred income.</p>

<p>All Child Support customers, who are parents, are required to <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Lodging-your-tax-return/">lodge a tax return</a>. In limited circumstances a customer may complete a non-lodgement advice with the ATO.</p>

<p>A taxable income is the preferred income, due to its accuracy.</p>

<p>Child Support cannot collect or record income details for non-parent carers.</p>

<p><strong>Check if lodgement is required - not required to lodge indicator</strong></p>

<p>If a customer receives any Australian Government allowances, pensions or payments (whether taxable or exempt), and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
taxable income</li>
		<li>
target foreign income</li>
		<li>
reportable fringe benefits</li>
		<li>
net financial investment loss</li>
		<li>
net rental property loss</li>
		<li>
reportable superannuation contributions</li>
		</ul>
<p>where the total amount is less than the self-support amount, they are not required to lodge a tax return. However, to ensure the most appropriate income is used in their child support assessment, they must lodge a non-lodgement advice with the ATO.</p>

<p>If a customer advises they are not required to lodge a tax return, check the customer's ATO records to ensure the ATO has recorded a 'not necessary to lodge' indicator (NN or NOTNEC) against the relevant income tax years. An indicator affects the dates the income can be used in a child support assessment. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Cuba_rules">Cuba rules</a>.</p>

<p>It is important to advise customers of the need to complete a non-lodgement advice with the ATO or a provisional income may be applied. To ensure the correct income is used, advise the customer to visit the ATO website.</p>

<p><strong>Contact the customer and encourage lodgement of tax returns</strong></p>

<p>Before contacting the customer check the Client Income window&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
to determine which financial year's taxable incomes are required and</li>
		<li>
for all available income information</li>
		</ul>
<p>Contact the customer using all available phone numbers. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-01010000-01.html">Contact with Child Support customers</a>. If you are unable to contact the customer, send a <strong>MX1-1 'Request to Contact CSA Letter'</strong> using the Letters List window in Cuba and the standard text. See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010400-01.html">Letters Cuba Process Help</a>. Include an <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/customer/forms/cs1668">Income Declaration</a> form when sending the letter.</p>

<p>Do not use the TRDB button when trying to locate an income unless processing a new or subsequent registration.</p>

<p>Encourage the customer to lodge the relevant tax return(s). Discuss&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
when they are able to lodge their tax return(s)</li>
		<li>
the implications of non-lodgement, including</li>
		<li>
if lodged out of time, and the income is lower than the provisional income currently being used in the assessment, it will not be backdated except in special circumstances. See Lodgement rules</li>
		<li>
options for a low income earner including fixed annual rate (FAR) not to apply or Minimum Annual Rate (MAR) to nil. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03090000-01.html">Fixed annual rate not to apply applications</a> or <a href="../separated-parents/277-03100000-01.html">Minimum annual rate to nil - Reducing child support assessments</a></li>
		<li>
prescribed circumstances, including if the customer is genuinely unable to provide timely information. See Section 11 of <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.legislation.gov.au/series/f2018l00307">Child Support (Assessment) Regulations 2018</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Gain the customers commitment to lodge and if appropriate take an income tax declaration (ITD) from the customer.</p>

<p>Ask the customer if they will be lodging with a tax agent as this will determine the date of effect the ATO income replaces a provisional income in the assessment. Advise the customer of the date of effect rules, including prescribed circumstances for late lodgement.</p>

<p>To obtain an ITD, <a href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Obtain_an_ATO_i_Step04">go to Step 4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Updating tax free pension and benefit amounts reported as taxable income</strong></p>

<p>When a customer in receipt of certain tax free pensions or benefits lodges their tax return and includes the tax free pension or benefit as an income for taxation purposes, Cuba will use this income twice. Cuba records the income from ATO as a taxable income, then adds the tax free pension or benefit amount from their Centrelink payments or Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) (or other source) again as a tax free pension or benefits other component amount.</p>

<p>If the ATO amends a person's tax assessment and the amendment is issued prior to 23 May 2018, Child Support can only use the amended income in circumstances prescribed by sub-section 56(2) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989.</p>

<p>An amended income will <strong>not</strong> be applied to a child support assessment (including estimate reconciliations) where the parent or the ATO Commissioner initiated the amendment to the taxable income on or after 1 July 2008 regardless of the year of income amended. There are 3 exceptions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An amended income will be used in a child support assessment if it has been recorded in the customer's Client Income window at the time the assessment is being made for a new child support period</li>
		<li>
If, at the time an estimate of income is to be reconciled, the parent's taxable income for the relevant year has been amended by the ATO (and that amended income is available to the Registrar), the amended income will be used in the reconciliation.</li>
		<li>
Where we are satisfied that the amendment to the income occurred due to one of the reasons specified in sub-section 56(2) of the Assessment Act. For example tax evasion or fraud. For incomes issued prior to 3 May 2014, amendments were considered to have been due to tax evasion or fraud if they resulted in a higher income. These higher amended incomes were automatically applied to the assessment. For incomes issued from 3 May 2014 to 22 May 2018 we required verification of the reason for the amendment. These amended incomes had to be manually applied to the assessment.</li>
		</ul>
<p>For details on how to retrieve ATO issued income details, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External searches guide</a>. To load an Amended ATO issued income, see <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010360-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Record_amended_">Income Cuba Process Help, record an amended taxable income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Date of effect of amended income</strong></p>

<p>If the ATO issue an amended taxable income prior to a child support assessment being made for a new child support period, the amended taxable income will be used to make the child support assessment from the first day of the new child support period.</p>

<p>If the ATO issue an amended taxable income after the child support assessment has been made and the income was amended due to tax evasion or fraud or any of the other reasons set out in s56(2), the amended taxable income will be used for all of the days in the child support period for which the parent's ATI is relevant (subject to the 'income rules' set out in section 58A).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; an amended ATO income, issued due to an ATO keying or scanning error, will not be used in a child support assessment. Either parent or the Registrar may initiate a change to the assessment (i.e. COA and RICA, respectively) or where the income is less than the income being used in the assessment, the parent whose income was amended may elect to estimate their income for the current financial year.</p>

<p>For information on how to apply amended ATO incomes, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Cuba_rules">Cuba rules</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Amendments to other components of a customer's ATI</strong></p>

<p>If there is a change to the 'other components' of a customer's ATI, the child support assessment will be amended using the amended ATI, for all the days in the Child Support Period that the ATI is relevant (subject to the 'income rules' set out in section 58A), regardless of whether the income increased or decreased.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
Where a customer is unable to provide information about their Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) at the time the assessment is made due to prescribed circumstances, they can request their ATI be applied from the start of the child support period.

		<li>
If the customer's assessment is the minimum annual rate, where the only payments received are those that are prescribed by Section 11 and therefore not considered to be income, the customer can apply for their assessment to be reduced to nil</li>
		<li>
If the customer is on the FAR, they can make an application for the FAR not to apply</li>
		<li>
If the customer is incarcerated for an entire financial year, and has no other source of income, their taxable income will be nil. Obtain an ITD, see Step 4.</li>
		<li>
If the customer has been incarcerated for part of a year and has no other source of income during the period of incarceration their taxable income will be nil for this period. Obtain an ITD or manually derive an income if 10 months of information is available</li>

<p><strong>Encourage customer to lodge an income tax declaration (ITD)</strong></p>

<p>If there is no ATO issued income available, an income tax declaration (ITD) can be used in an assessment. If a customer advises they are going to lodge a tax return, encourage them to lodge an ITD in the interim. This will enable Child Support to calculate a more accurate assessment and minimise the risk of being unable to vary the assessment retrospectively if there is a delay in lodgement.</p>

<p>Check the Client Income window to determine previous year's incomes. If the customer has not lodged a tax return for a number of years, remind the customer that they are required to lodge a tax return.</p>

<p><strong>Obtain ITD details</strong></p>

<p>An ITD can be provided verbally or in writing. When obtaining an ITD, ask the customer for their income for the LRYI including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
income from salary and wage, including parental leave payments (post 1 January 2011)</li>
		<li>
income from taxable and tax-free pensions/benefits</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> to determine the tax free pension or benefit component of a customer DVA entitlement, request the information from DVA. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03030000-01.html">Direct requests for information from Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)</a>.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
details (e.g. name) of taxable and tax-free pensions/benefits</li>
		<li>
the source(s) of income (e.g. employer name, Centrelink)</li>
		<li>
details of other component income such as <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ato.gov.au/general/fringe-benefits-tax-%28fbt%29/in-detail/employees/reportable-fringe-benefits---facts-for-employees/">reportable fringe benefits</a> or rental income</li>

		<li>
how the amount was calculated</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer has been incarcerated for an entire financial year, and has no other source of income, their taxable income will be nil.</p>

<p>Explain to the customer that an ITD is a signed declaration of their income for a past financial year and includes <strong>all</strong> sources of income.</p>

<p>Check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the External Information window in Cuba. See External information Window Help, and/or</li>
		<li>
ATO systems</li>
		</ul>
<p>to locate any income information.</p>

<p>If income information is found, discuss with the customer and determine if this information will assist them in lodging an ITD.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>&#58; information is located indicating the customer received $50,000 from a sole employer. Ask the customer if this was the only source of income they received or if they received additional income.</p>

<p>If there are any discrepancies in the information provided by the customer, investigate and verify the information before accepting the ITD. This may involve clarifying the information provided with the parent or contacting third parties such as employers, Centrelink, or checking ATO systems.</p>

<p>Customers often confuse an ITD with an estimate. Clearly explain that an ITD relates to <strong>past</strong> income and an estimate relates to future income. Customers may need to provide an ITD to enable them to proceed with an estimate. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07040000-01.html">Child support estimates (Post 1 July 2010).</a></p>

<p>The following searches may be conducted to locate income information for the customer. Information should be sought informally first (e.g. over the phone) as this is the most efficient method, only send an s161 notice if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Search using Cuba</strong></p>

<p>Income information received from the Centrelink and ATO can be obtained from searching the External Information window in Cuba. The information is automatically retrieved on a periodic basis for customers.</p>

<p>For assistance see External Information Window Help.</p>

<p><strong>Transaction search facility (TSF) search</strong></p>

<p>A TSF search provides details obtained from various ATO databases. The following searches can be made&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an immediate search will provide customer details on the previous three financial years, or an overnight search will provide customer details for years preceding the last three financial years</li>
		</ul>
<p>For assistance in accessing and using TSF, see the <a href="../separated-parents/277-04370000-01.html">External searches guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated core processing (ICP)</strong></p>

<p><strong>TR Corporate Applications search</strong></p>

<p>The Declaration Management System within TR Corporate Applications provides information on a customer's employer details and employment history.</p>

<p>A search provides the name and address of an employer, including contact details and the customer's employment status.</p>

<p>This information may be used to send an s161 to an employer.</p>

<p>Where necessary, an s161 can be issued to a customer's employer to seek information about the customer's income to correct an income to amend a formula assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a s161 cannot be used to seek information about income to assist in collection action. A s120 should not be used to collect income information.

<p><strong>Cuba derives income</strong></p>

<p>Cuba will automatically derive an income for the LRYI where 10 months of income information is available. This information is received from Centrelink, and can be viewed in the External Information window.</p>

<p>Check the derived income to ensure it is correct, as the payment received may be a once off lump sum. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_deri_Step02">Derived income for Child Support customers, Processing a derived income, Step 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the rules regarding date of lodgement only apply to days in a child support period after 1 July 2008. Different rules apply to the days in a child support period prior to 1 July 2008. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010000-01.html">Income processing for Child Support customers</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/4">the Child Support Guide 2.4.4&#58; Child support income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key lodgement dates</strong></p>

<p>All Child Support customers, who are parents, are required to lodge a tax return unless they satisfy the exemption rules specified by the Australian Taxation Office.</p>

<p>In these circumstances a customer should complete a Non-lodgement advice with the ATO. This will result in a 'Return Not Necessary' indicator (RNN) being placed on their tax records for the relevant year.</p>

<p>If a customer's Australian Government pension, allowance or payment (including DVA and Centrelink) and their taxable income is less than $16,000, the ATO may determine that they are not required to lodge a tax return. The agency who paid the pension, allowance or payment will advise the ATO, who will apply a RNN indicator to the customer's record if they determine the customer is not required to lodge. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> $16,000 is based on 2011 figures. Refer to ATO.</p>

<p>The due date for individuals to lodge their tax return or a Non-lodgement advice is 31 October each year. If a customer uses a tax agent, they will have a later lodgement date according to the ATO tax agent <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ato.gov.au/Tax-professionals/Prepare-and-lodge/Tax-agent-lodgment-program/">lodgement program</a> Cuba will determine if a return has been lodged late.</p>

<p>The key lodgement dates for businesses alter depending what is required to be lodged. These dates can be found on the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.ato.gov.au/business/reports-and-returns/due-dates-for-lodging-and-paying/">Australian Tax Office</a> website.</p>

<p>Key lodgement dates determine the date of effect&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for ATO incomes when they are replacing provisional incomes in Cuba and</li>
		<li>
when one provisional income is replacing another provisional income in an assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Replacing provisional incomes</strong></p>

<p>A provisional income will be used in the assessment if the customers ATO issued income tax details are not available when a new Child Support Period starts.</p>

<p>The date a tax return is lodged determines if an income will be&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
backdated to the start of a child support period to replace a provisional income or</li>
		<li>
used from the date the tax return was lodged</li>
		</ul>
<p>Cuba will recognise if an income received from the ATO was lodged by a tax agent on the customer's behalf and will automatically update the income in accordance with the correct 'backdating' rules.</p>

<p><strong>Date of effect</strong></p>

<p>When a new ATO income is received, the date of effect to the assessment is the <strong>beginning</strong> of the relevant child support period where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the tax return for the last relevant year of income is (or can be) lodged on time or</li>
		<li>
the new income is higher than the current income, even if the tax return was lodged later than the ATO timeframe or</li>
		<li>
the customer was genuinely unable to provide the income information due to prescribed circumstances or</li>
		<li>
the customer was a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction and the customer responded to a request for information within 60 days</li>
		</ul>
<p>Otherwise the amendment to the assessment will take effect from the issue date of the Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI), for the remainder of the child support period.</p>

<p>If a customer lodges their tax return late, and their ATO-issued income is lower than the provisional income and none of the prescribed circumstances apply, the income will not be backdated to the start of the child support period.</p>

<p>See the <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Date_of_effect">Date of effect</a> table in Resources or the <a target="_blank" href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/4">Child Support Guide 2.4.4&#58; Child support income</a>.</p>

<p>A customer can request their ATI be applied from the start of the child support period if at the time the assessment was made, they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
were unaware that an assessment had been made</li>

		</ul>
<p>It is the responsibility of the customer to provide income details within a reasonable period of time <strong>after</strong> the special or exceptional circumstances ceased to prevent them.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptional circumstances</strong></p>

<p>The following may be considered to be exceptional for the purposes of <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.legislation.gov.au/series/f2018l00307">Section 11</a>&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Consequences of non-lodgement</strong></p>

<p>If a customer does not lodge their tax return, their child support assessment may not be accurate. If an ATO income is not available, then the customer's income amount must be determined. If this income is incorrect the customer may be paying too much or not enough child support. This could cause a debt when the customer does lodge their tax return.</p>

<p><strong>Lodgement enforcement</strong></p>

<p>Where customer information is available that indicates that either the customer has arrears that may be addressed by a TRIP, or if there is sufficient evidence to indicate that Lodgement will alter the customer's CS assessment, then the customer can be referred for Lodgement enforcement. For more information or to refer a customer, see the Lodgement Enforcement page.</p>

<p>When an ATO issued income becomes available Cuba will automatically update or replace an existing income if the case is&#58;</p>

		</ul>
<p>If a case is ended, go to Step 2.</p>

<p>When a customer lodges their tax return which includes income support payments via a tax agent, the lodgement dates and income fields will auto populate in the Client Income window.</p>

<p><strong>ATO amended incomes</strong></p>

<p>Services Australia may receive notification that a customer's taxable income has been amended. If the amendment was issued prior to 23 May 2018, we will not take the amended income into account in the child support assessment (including estimate reconciliations) where the income amendment was initiated (by the customer or the ATO) on or after 1 July 2008 regardless of the year of income amended. There are three exceptions to this rule outlined below.</p>

<p>When we receive notification of an amended income Cuba will record the amended income with a status of 'FOR INFORMATION' but will not change the assessment</p>

<p>Determine if the assessment should be amended based on one of these 3 exceptions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
An amended income will be used in a child support assessment if it has been recorded in the customer's Client Income window at the time the assessment is being made for a new child support period.</li>
		<li>
If, at the time an estimate of income is to be reconciled, the parent's taxable income for the relevant year has been amended by the ATO (and that amended income is available to the Registrar), the amended income will be used in the reconciliation.</li>
		<li>
Where we are satisfied that the amendment to the income occurred due to one of the reasons specified in sub-section 56(2) of the Assessment Act. (e.g. Tax evasion or fraud).</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if an amended taxable income is already being used in a child support assessment and the amendment to the income was initiated&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before 1 July 2008, the amended income is not subject to the revised policy and will remain in use in the relevant assessment</li>
		<li>
on or after 1 July 2008, the amended income will remain in use unless and until action is taken to manually remove it from the relevant assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p>There may be circumstances where a parent advises that the amendment of their tax assessment was initiated prior to 1 July 2008 and the amendment was not due to tax evasion or fraud (or any other reason set out in sub-section 56(2)). Such cases should be escalated to your Quality Advisor to seek clarification from Program Advice.</p>

<p><strong>Amended taxable income due to tax evasion or fraud</strong></p>

<p>An amended taxable income should be used in a child support assessment where the amendment occurred due to one of the reasons set out in sub-section 56(2) (e.g. tax evasion or fraud).</p>

<p>Unless there is reliable information to suggest otherwise, an amendment to a person's income tax assessment will not be considered to be due to tax evasion or fraud if the amendment was&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
initiated by the person or</li>
		<li>
made within the person's statutory time limit for an amendment</li>
		</ul>
<p>The statutory time limits for amendments are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
two years for most individuals or very small business taxpayers (small business entities), and</li>
		<li>
four years for all other business taxpayers, trustees, beneficiaries of certain types of trusts, taxpayers who entered into or carried out a scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a scheme benefit and taxpayers in other high-risk categories prescribed by Regulation</li>
		</ul>
<p>from the date of the original tax assessment.</p>

<p>The ATO have advised that amendments made within the statutory time limits are not made due to tax evasion or fraud.</p>

<p>Escalate these amendments to the QA for further assistance.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../separated-parents/277-30010360-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Record_amended_">Income Cuba process help, record an amended taxable income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Amendments to other components of a customer's ATI</strong></p>

<p>If there is a change to the 'other components' of a customer's ATI which does not affect the customer's ATO income, the assessment will be amended using the amended ATI for all the days in the Child Support Period that the ATI is relevant (subject to the 'income rules' set out in section 58A), regardless of whether the income increased or decreased.</p>

<p><strong>ATO amended incomes - effect on provisional income</strong></p>

<p>If a prior year ATO income has been amended and that income has been used in the calculation of a deemed or indexed default income in another assessment, the assessment based on the deemed or indexed default income will change.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Cuba will not automatically use an ATO amended income to calculate a deemed or indexed default income. If you determine that a ATO amended income should be used in the calculation on the basis that the original tax assessment was amended due to 56(2), you must calculate and load the information into CUBA manually.</p>

<p>If a customer lodges their tax return late, and has applied under prescribed circumstances for their ATO income to be used from the start of the relevant child support period, Cuba <strong>will not</strong> automatically give effect to this change.</p>

<p>To ensure the correct date is used, contact an SSO to lodge a CIF to ensure the ATO income is used in the assessment from the start date of the child support period.</p>

<p>EL2 approval <strong>must</strong> be obtained. This is an ICT requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Not required to lodge</strong></p>

<p>Cuba does not apply an income amount when a Non-lodgement indicator is received. The non lodgement advice indicated that the customer received ISP income only for the duration of the financial year. If you are unable to determine an ATI for the customer, load the income in the Client Income window.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>ISP Box checked -</strong> This must be checked if Child Support is aware of an ISP payment otherwise a fixed annual rate may apply. See the <a href="https&#58;//guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/11">Child Support Guide 2.4.11 Fixed Annual Rate of Child Support for Certain Low Income Parents</a> for information about Income Support Payments (ISP) to determine whether the <strong>Includes ISP</strong> box should be ticked</li>
		</ul>
<p>If replacing the income causes an overpayment, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-04260000-01.html">Child support overpayments and other payee debt</a>.</p>

<p>For information regarding Non-lodgement of Tax Returns, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-07020000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Obtain_an_ATO_i_Step05">Step 5 in Table 3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Negative taxable income</strong></p>

<p>If an income provided by the ATO is a negative amount, the taxable income amount is considered to be zero. The amount of zero is recorded in the Client Income window and an explanatory notepad is automatically added advising that a negative income has been received from the ATO.</p>
