<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_About_CCeS"></a>
<h2 id="_Toc344898764">About CCeS</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CCeS is a secure online service that provides an efficient and effective method for businesses to confirm customer information with Services Australia. For example, a business can check a customerâ€™s concession card type and status in CCeS, or their payment type and status.</p>

<p>Details from CCeS allows the business to make a determination as to whether the customer is entitled to a concession, rebate or service it offers under their policy requirements and rules. Services Australia is not responsible for deciding if a customer is entitled to a concession, rebate or service.</p>

<p>If a business uses the service to check customer information, it generally means the customer will not have to give them the details. In most cases, the business can tell the customer immediately if they are eligible for a concession, rebate or service.   </p>

<p>Businesses interested in applying to use CCeS, or who want to discuss how the service may benefit them, can have their contact details referred to the Third Party Programmes Team for follow up.</p>

<p>Businesses already approved for CCeS should contact the National Business Gateway - Confirmation Services Helpdesk for technical support.   </p>

<p>Businesses can find out more information about the service on the Services Australia website. They can download the CCeS policy, terms and procedural guide documents and the CCeS business application form (SA391). </p>

<p>In accordance with the Privacy Act 1988, it is mandatory for a business to obtain consent from the customer before the business can verify and confirm a customerâ€™s details and concession entitlement with the agency.</p>

<p>Businesses must also ensure that the customerâ€™s information they obtain through CCeS is protected and secure at all times.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>There are several confirmation eServices available to businesses in CCeS. The service a business will use depends on the information they need to confirm customer concessions.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Customer confirmation</strong></p>

<p>Confirms a customer's details such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
name</li>
		<li>
address</li>
		<li>
payment type</li>
		<li>
concession card status</li>
		</ul>
<p>This helps businesses confirm if a customer is entitled to their concession, service or rebate without requiring the customer to collect and provide evidence from the agency.</p>

<p>A 'yes' or 'no' answer is provided to the business to verify customer details.</p>

<p>It can be used for Centrelink and Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) customers through single, batch and webservice enquiries.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Income confirmation</strong></p>

<p>This service provides a business with a customer's income, asset and payment details, similar to the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09020060-01.html">Income Statement or Details Income and Assets Statement</a> that a customer can request.</p>

<p>This service can only be used for Centrelink customers through single, batch and webservice enquiries. It cannot be used for DVA customers.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Superannuation confirmation</strong></p>

<p>Administrators and trustees of super funds can use this service to help determine a customer's eligibility for the <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-09020000-01.html">Early Release of Superannuation on financial hardship grounds</a>. The service will provide a 'yes' or 'no' response if the customer meets one of the income support requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Customer is below preservation age plus 39 weeks, and had a continuous payment period of 26 weeks immediately before the application, or</li>
		<li>
Customer meets preservation age plus 39 weeks or more, and has a cumulative payment period total of 39 weeks after reaching their preservation age</li>

<p>When applying to use CCeS the business must indicate how it wishes to use CCeS. Businesses can use the service to confirm customer data through a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Single enquiry</strong> - which allows a business to submit an enquiry for one customer. It provides an immediate response</li>
		<li>
<strong>Batch enquiry</strong> - can be used for large volume requests for multiple customers. Also provides historical income statements (including quarterly and financial year). A response is returned within 72 hours</li>
		<li>
<strong>System to system (webservice)</strong> - this provides a direct connection between a businessâ€™s ICT system and Services Australiaâ€™s database. It provides an immediate response. A Secret Key is provided to the business which is used to authenticate the business for the use of the web service. The Secret Key must be protected from disclosure and a Secret Key Manager must be appointed by the business who is responsible for the management and use of the key</li>

<p>The business must verify the identity of the customer before getting consent and using CCeS.</p>

<p>Customers can give their consent to businesses in writing, online or verbally. An example of the standard consent wording and requirements is available in the <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-09010000-05.html#bp05_L2GT_Services_Austra">CCeS procedural guide</a>.  </p>

<p>Customers can contact the agency to request to block a business from accessing their personal information through the service.</p>

<p>Businesses must collect consent from each individual customer before they access their personal information. If eligibility for a concession, rebate or service is based on the confirmed information of multiple customers (for example, all household members listed on a housing application) each customer must provide their own informed consent for the business to use CCeS. </p>

<p>There may be situations where a business must provide customer information from CCeS to a third party. For example, where they provide a concession on behalf of a second business and are being audited. This secondary disclosure is only permitted if the customer provides their consent (in the consent record) to have their information disclosed to the third party for the secondary purpose. See the CCeS Procedural Guide for the extra wording that must be included in the consent record when disclosing information to a third party.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>CCeS is a free service and there are no costs to customers or businesses to use CCeS. </p>

<p>If a business chooses to use the batch enquiry or system to system (webservice) enquiry, testing is required and fees apply.</p>

<p>If a business asks for extra customer information that is not available through CCeS, this may incur a fee to cover the agencyâ€™s costs. Requests for changes to the CCeS service should be referred to the Deduction and Confirmation Branch - CCeS team.</p>

<p>Enquiries about testing fees, processes and timeframes can be made through the National Business Gateway &gt; Confirmation Services Helpdesk.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc344898764">Restricted access customers</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If a business makes an enquiry in CCeS for a customer with a Restricted Access record, customer information will still be provided to the business with the exception of address information. A value of Unable to Confirm is returned to the business instead for address information. For example, if the business is wanting to confirm the customerâ€™s name, date of birth, address and pension card status; the service will confirm â€˜Yesâ€™ for name, date of birth and pension card but will return an â€˜Unable to Confirmâ€™ for the address. It is up to the business how it responds to this result. </p>

<p>Businesses determine and apply their own policy and rules around what information and evidence they need in order to confirm a customerâ€™s eligibility for a concession, rebate or service. Where CCeS cannot be used by a business to confirm eligibility to a concession or rebate, the customer will need to provide alternative evidence as determined acceptable by the business (such as an income statement). The agency cannot compel a business to provide any concession, rebate or service for any reason.</p>

<p>The Contact Address Verification (CAV) service enables approved housing providers to obtain the current address and telephone details held by Services Australia for a customer, and historical address details for up to 2 years in the past. This information can help housing providers with the assessment of housing applications for Centrelink customers who are suffering from recurring homelessness, require supported housing and/or have special housing needs.</p>

<p>Customers must give their consent for the housing provider to get their details from Services Australia. Consent wording for CAV can be included in the CCeS consent record.  </p>

<p>If a housing provider is interested in using the CAV service please refer the details to the Deduction and Confirmation branch - CCeS team.</p>
