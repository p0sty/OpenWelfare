<p>A system error may show if&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
changes are made to Real Estate/ Business Summary (<strong>REBS</strong>) screen details, and </li>
		<li>
updates have not been made since the customer’s relationship status changed.<br>This will happen if the customer is single and the real estate is still recorded as partly or fully owned by the partner</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; <strong>Do not</strong> code $1 for the property value or 1% or 0.1% asset owned. This creates issues with the agency’s external contracted valuers, and valuations are still auto requested at a cost to the agency.</p>

<p>If this error occurs when attempting changes to the customer's <strong>REBS</strong> details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
On the Real Estate (<strong>RE</strong>) screen, print or copy all pages about the impacted property or business, showing the Current Market Value, Event Date and other relevant details. Include all historical pages</li>
		<li>
In the one activity&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
delete the relevant property from the <strong>REBS</strong> screen</li>
			<li>
recode on <strong>REBS</strong> as a new property, using the screen prints to recreate all historical entries on <strong>RE</strong>, including relevant details such as <strong>Valuers Job Number&#58;</strong> and the correct <strong>% Asset Owned&#58;</strong></li>
			<li>
if system error '<strong>E016RB – Asset valuation source of AVO not valid</strong>' shows, recode all <strong>AVO</strong> entries prior to 28 June 2014 using the Asset Valuation Source type <strong>CLI</strong> </li>
			<li>
ensure all other <strong>Asset Valuation Source&#58;</strong> codes match the historical entries</li>
			<li>
if the <strong>REVI</strong> screen was originally blank, it may be necessary to locate the property details on a previously supplied MOD R or online claim questions </li>
			<li>
finalise the activity</li>
			<li>
<strong>DOC</strong> the record detailing the updates made, including change in % of ownership and AVO error resulting in alternate coding of <strong>CLI</strong></li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this should not create any overpayment or arrears payment for the customer if no other income and assets updates are completed in the same activity. Once the property details are recoded, <strong>REBS</strong> should allow updates without the error appearing.</p>

<p>Check the former partner’s record to see if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the property is still being assessed</li>
		<li>
the former partner is deceased see <a href="../bereavement/099-02020110-01.html">Undoing a death action</a></li>
