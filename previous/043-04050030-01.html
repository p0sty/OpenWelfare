<p>This document details processes for determining how income from a trust or company is distributed to stakeholders and how distribution income is recorded. Different rules apply to an approved Special Disability Trust (SDT). This procedure does not cover SDTs.</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Distribution_income"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Distribution_income">Distribution income</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Distribution income is the actual distribution from a private trust or a dividend payment from a private company made to a stakeholder. This includes distributions or dividends paid to another related entity (private trust or company). This payment is on the private trust distribution statement or private company dividend statement. For a private trust, the distribution statement is part of the trust tax return. It lists the name and Tax File Number (TFN) and/or date of birth of each beneficiary (if under 18 years of age) allocated with a distribution in that financial year and the amount of the distribution to each. For a company, as well as a profit and loss statement, there may be a schedule outlining the dividends paid to shareholders. It is declared as cents per share or as a percentage.</p>

<p>Distribution income is disregarded in some situations, this is so double counting does not occur. The circumstances are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Distributions or dividends made from prior year profits to controllers are not assessed as they are paid out of the retained profits (capital) of the entity</li>
		<li>
Where a customer is a controller and receives an actual distribution or dividend payment, any distributions received that are less than the attribution income amount are not assessed as income. If there are multiple controllers and a controller receives income from an entity <strong>less than</strong> the attributed amount, that is, less than the percentage of the entity attributed to the individual, the amount of income <strong>less than</strong> the attributable amount is to be treated as a gift from the controller and the deprivation rules are to apply. For example, controller A and controller B (who are not partnered) are each attributed with 50% of the income and assets of a company. The company makes a profit of $10,000, $7,000 is distributed to controller A and $3,000 is distributed to controller B. Because controller B has been distributed with less than their attribution income, they are considered to have gifted $2,000</li>
		<li>
Only distributions (that are not paid from prior year profits) in excess of the customer's <strong>attribution income amount</strong> are assessed as distribution income</li>
		<li>
Distributions paid to genuine investors and non-controllers are assessed as income for those persons as prescribed by section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991)</li>
		<li>
Where an entity is attributed with control of a subsidiary entity, and receives a distribution from it, then the distribution will not be counted as part of the assessable income of the principal entity. The attributable income of the subsidiary entity becomes the principal entity's attributed income, which when combined with its own assessable income, becomes the attributable income of the principal entity. By ensuring the distribution is not counted as part of the principal entity's assessable income, double counting is avoided</li>
		</ul>
<p>Other distribution income rules specific to controllers and non-controllers include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Distributions or dividends which represent transfers of entity assets, sometimes known as 'capital transfers', and if paid to non-controllers will not be assessed as income of the non-controller. An example of this is the transfer of a car to a non-controller. However, dividends paid out of prior year profits, which had as their source ordinary income or capital gains of the entity, will be assessed as income under section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991 for any non-controllers</li>
		<li>
When an entity ceases trading or winds up, the attribution income can be set to zero. In addition, the distribution income for a controller and their partner can also be set to zero. Where a controller ceases involvement with an entity the attribution income can be set to zero and any final distribution received is not assessed, but any distribution received prior to severing ties is assessed for 52 weeks under section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991</li>
		<li>
Where a controller requests a reassessment based on an estimate of the attributable income of an entity, and the estimate is accepted, it will be necessary to adjust the distributions made to the controller (and their partner if they are not a controller), if any, to an estimated amount</li>
		<li>
Distribution income for <strong>non-controllers</strong> will continue to be assessed as income for 52 weeks in all circumstances even when the entity has ceased trading or wound up or the customer is no longer involved with the entity under section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991</li>
		<li>
Distributions may be excluded from an assessment as a lump sum under section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991 when the amount was received periodically (for example, fortnightly or monthly) or the customer can demonstrate they were paid in lieu of wages. For the non-controller beneficiary they will be assessed when received and not at the end of the financial year as a lump sum. For the controller of the trust, it will still form part of the attributable income but disregard gifting if they were paid in lieu of wages </li>
		<li>
If the customer is advising the distributions were paid either periodically or in lieu of wages, refer to relevant Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for assistance </li>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessment_of_capita">Distributions and Family Domestic Violence (FDV)</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The Social Security Act 1991 (the Act) does not contain specific provisions to enable assessable income to be disregarded due to hardship caused by FDV. For non-attributable stakeholders, distributions/dividends received from private trusts/companies are included in an income support recipient's income. Distribution or dividend amounts are included for a period of 52 weeks from the date the customer is legally entitled to receive the distribution.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to apply Section 8(11) of the Act to address this issue on a case by case basis. Under Section 8(11) of the Act, the Secretary's delegate is able to make an instrument to exempt one off lump sums from the income test. Exemptions are typically provided to classes of payment, but may also be provided to an individual.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Assessment_of_c">Assessment of capital gains</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The assessment of capital gains (that is, resulting from the sale of an asset) will be assessed as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
for controllers capital gains from normal trading (for example, sale of shares, managed investments on a regular basis) will be assessed but not one-off sale of assets (for example, sale of a factory or a work vehicle)</li>
		<li>
for non-controllers all capital gains will be assessed as income along with other distributions of profit</li>
		</ul>
<p>When capital gains are assessed, usually (but not always), the capital gain will be included on the financial statements of the trust or company.</p>

<p>Under the Social Security Act, when assessing attributed and distributed income, all of the capital gain is assessed without any discount, indexation or any other amount that is allowed under the Income Tax Assessment Act. For example, 50% capital gain discount or prior year capital losses.</p>

<p>Accordingly, CAOs will only be able to assess the whole capital gain from the full financial statements of the entity and identifying the whole capital gain.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A beneficiary is entitled to receive an amount under a private trust when the trustee exercises their power under the trust deed and makes a <strong>resolution</strong> to distribute in favour of the beneficiary. Allocations and distributions are assessed as income for 52 weeks under subsection 1073(1) from the date of the resolution to distribute, if the dollar amount is included in the resolution to distribute.</p>

<p>If the resolution to distribute states a percentage and not a specific amount, the beneficiary's legal entitlement to a distribution only commences from the date the amount is known. This is usually when the tax return is completed. The date the amount is known is the date of event.</p>

<p>There may be instances where a resolution to distribute a specific amount (for example $10,000) has been made but the trust tax return has not been lodged at the time of resolution. Where this is the case, the onus is on the income support recipient to notify about the distribution. Distribution income should still be assessed from the date the resolution was made and not the date the tax return was lodged. See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-05.html">Resources</a> for an example.</p>

<p><strong>Distributions from discretionary trusts when a resolution to distribute an amount of profit is made, but the total profit is not yet known</strong></p>

<p>A person is entitled to receive the amount when they have an absolute vested interest in the amount and are legally able to demand payment of the amount. A person cannot demand payment of an unspecified amount and therefore is entitled to receive the amount only when a figure is specified.</p>

<p>Where there has been a resolution to distribute an unspecified amount, the distribution only becomes assessable when the person becomes entitled to legally demand a specific amount. <br>See <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04050030-05.html">Resources</a> for an example.</p>

<p><strong>Gifting provisions for controllers when a distribution or dividend is paid to a non-controller</strong></p>

<p>Distribution or dividends paid to a <strong>non-attributable</strong> stakeholder after 1 July 2000 may be assessed as a gift from the attributable stakeholder(s), subject to their attribution percentage. The amount received by the non-attributable stakeholder is assessed as income for 52 weeks from the date of the resolution to distribute.</p>

<p><strong>Exception</strong>&#58; distributions paid to a non-attributable stakeholder will be disregarded under the gifting provisions for the attributable stakeholder if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer can show they were not in receipt of an income support payment and could not have reasonably known they would require income support at the time the distribution or dividend was paid, or</li>
		<li>
the non-attributable stakeholder is a Genuine Investor and the distribution paid to the Genuine Investor is commensurate with their investment in the entity, or </li>
		<li>
the distributions have been paid in lieu of wages </li>
		</ul>
<p>All distributions to controllers and non-controllers, including other trusts and companies, should be coded on the system. The system will pass the distribution amount to the customer's record and ensure any deprivation or gifting is calculated correctly.</p>

<p>Distributions to full or part controllers made from profits from previous years are not assessed as income and should not be coded.</p>

<p>Distributions to non-controllers made from profits from previous years are assessed as income and should be coded as they have their source from ordinary income or capital gains of the entity and accordingly the distributions will be assessed as income for the non-controller for 52 weeks from the date of resolution to distribute under section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Distribution or dividends from a private trust or company are not employment income. The exception is when the distributions are considered to be paid in lieu of wages and coded as employment income. Ordinary income is used when calculating the accrual of working credits, but is unable to deplete the customer’s Working Credit balance to offset this income. Work Bonus cannot be applied to distributions, dividends nor attribution income prior to 1 July 2019, unless the distributions are considered to be paid in lieu of wages and coded as employment income.</p>

<p>From <strong>1 July 2019</strong>, Work Bonus may be applied to distributions, dividends or attribution income received by a customer of Age Pension age and in receipt of income support payments (apart from PPS). Work Bonus will be applied only where the customer’s role in the trust or company involves personal exertion (that is, the customer’s direct involvement helps generate income for the entity). This could include such activities such as truck driving, book keeping, or sales.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If the customer is receiving a wage or director's fees for a private trust or company, the customer can deplete their Working Credit balance to offset this employment income only. If the customer is eligible for Work Bonus any available balance can also offset this income.</p>
