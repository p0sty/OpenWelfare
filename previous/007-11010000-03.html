<p>Reconciliation is an automatic process that occurs after the end of a relevant financial year for customers who have been paid FTB as either fortnightly payments or a lump sum.</p>

<p>For customers to receive their full annual FTB entitlement, income lodgement requirements must be met by the end of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12 or earlier years).</p>

<p>At reconciliation, the system&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
calculates correct FTB entitlement based on actual dates of changes in circumstances, actual income details transferred from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (if required), or income provided by the customer when completing a not required to lodge advice, immunisation status and actual maintenance income</li>
		<li>
includes, if entitled, Part A supplement, Part B supplement, Energy Supplement Part A and Part B and <a href="../families/007-10010000-01.html">Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS)</a> in maximum annual FTB entitlement once all required information and adequate income or not required to lodge details are available. SIFS is assessed using taxable income, not adjusted taxable income (ATI), which means FTB reconciliation may result in only SIFS being assessed. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> SIFS is not payable to new claimants for 2017-18 and later financial years. Grandfathering provisions apply for current customers</li>
		<li>
assesses entitlement to Part B quarantine period if return to work details are recorded</li>
		<li>
compares correct entitlement based on actual adjusted taxable income and maintenance income with the amount of FTB the customer was paid during the financial year using estimated income and estimated maintenance income</li>
		<li>
will use a top-up to <a href="../families/007-11060000-01.html">offset any debts</a>, even if a payment arrangement exists</li>
		</ul>
<p><a href="../families/007-11010090-01.html">Special processing rules apply for ex-partners</a>.</p>

<p>The result of FTB reconciliation can be either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
no change</li>
		<li>
a top-up payment issued by Centrelink which may be used to offset other family assistance, social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts or tax debts, or</li>
		<li>
a debt, part or all of which may be recovered from tax refunds. Tax refunds can be used to recover any FTB debt as well as Child Care Benefit (CCB)/Child Care Rebate (CCR) debts determined after 1 July 2016</li>		</ul>

<p>Reconciliation can occur from 2 July of the lodgement year once all information is available, including actual income details needed for the customer (and/or their current partner) if required.</p>

<p>From 2018-19, reconciliation will not occur until a child’s immunisation status has been received. Additionally, for FTB instalment claims, reconciliation will not occur until all FTB Part A immunisation grace periods that started in the financial year have been completed. See <a href="../families/007-18043002-01.html">Immunisation requirements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A from 1 July 2018</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer queries why reconciliation has not occurred, see <a href="../families/007-11010020-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation or lump sum claim pending</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic FTB reconciliation</strong> will occur in the first 2 weeks of July of the lodgement year for customers who have received their last payment for the financial year and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have adequate income/not required to lodge details available, or</li>
		<li>
are single and on an income support payment with no gaps in payment or <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">employment income nil rate periods</a> for the entire period they were FTB current during the financial year, e.g. Parenting Payment Single (PPS)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Partial reconciliation</strong>, including FTB supplements, can occur from 2 July following the relevant year if only ex-partner actual income details are needed for reconciliation to occur. SIFS is not paid for a partnered period if partner income is not known. <a href="../families/007-11010090-01.html">Special processing applies for customers with an ex-partner</a>.</p>

<p>Reconciliation will remain pending until all required information is available for reconciliation. See <a href="../families/007-11010020-01.html">Family Tax Benefit (FTB) reconciliation or lump sum claim pending</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> before August 2022, customers residing in locations affected by disaster events may have their FTB reconciliation remain pending ‘debt deferral’ where the outcome was a debt.</p>

<p>From 2015-16 financial year onwards, forced reconciliation <strong>no longer applies</strong>. Reconciliation will not occur until the customer and their partner confirm their income for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>For financial years 2014-15 and earlier, forced reconciliation may have been done on some records.</p>

<p>Forced reconciliation was the process where the system attempted to reconcile some records that were <a href="../families/007-11010020-01.html">held pending</a>. It occurred from <strong>mid-November of the lodgement year</strong>, for the following pending reasons&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Low Income Review</strong></p>

<p>The customer (or their partner) had an estimated income below $6,000 and was neither a Liable Parent nor a Recipient Parent under a child support assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Child Deferral</strong></p>

<p>Prior to 1 May 2014, if the customer deferred payment of FTB for any child until after the end of the relevant year, and did not advise whether the child's income had exceeded the child income limit, reconciliation excluded the deferred child.</p>

<p>From 13 June 2015, no new instances of child deferral could be coded. From 1 July 2015, customers with the child deferral payment choice in place had the choice ignored.</p>

<p>From the 2014-15 financial year, deferred children were automatically included in the reconciliation result as child income requirements no longer applied.</p>

<p><strong>300 day Income Support</strong></p>

<p>The customer (or their partner) received income support payments for more than 300 days in the financial year, and&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer did not receive any FTB Part B while partnered during the year, and</li>
		<li>
the income support customer is neither a Liable Parent nor a Recipient Parent under a Child Support Assessment</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Child Disability Allowance (CDA)/Double Orphan Pension (DOP) saved FTB rate</strong></p>

<p>The customer has been paid a CDA or DOP saved rate of FTB for the whole financial year and they did not receive any FTB Part B while partnered during the year.</p>

<p><strong>ATO</strong></p>

<p>After income details have been received from the ATO, details of family assistance debts are sent back to the ATO for possible debt offsetting from the customer's (or their consenting partner's) tax refund.</p>

<p>Debt offsetting from tax refunds may occur regardless of whether a repayment arrangement is in place.</p>

<p>The ATO will advise Centrelink of any amounts used to recover outstanding family assistance debts.</p>

<p>FTB instalment arrears, reconciliation top-ups and lump sum claim amounts can be automatically used to repay family assistance, social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts. This will happen even if the customer has a payment arrangement in place.</p>

<p>Temporary exclusion from debt offsetting may be considered if <a href="../families/007-11060000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Temporary_exclu01">special circumstances apply</a>.</p>

<p>An FTB top-up or lump sum claim amount, after debt offsetting by Centrelink, may be used by the ATO to offset tax debts if the ATO has not yet issued the Notice of Assessment (NOA).</p>

<p>Centrelink will issue any remaining FTB top-up amount to the customer after debt offsetting, and issue a letter to advise the customer of the result.</p>

<p>As Newborn Supplement (NBS) is a component of FTB Part A, it can be used in debt offsetting or may be included in the top-up. Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) can only be used to offset a previous NBU debt. A separate letter will be sent to the customer about NBU.</p>

<p>Since 1 July 2009, the ATO no longer delivers FTB reconciliation or lump sum claim payment to the customer or advises FTB entitlement details in the Notice of Assessment (NOA) issued to advise the tax assessment.</p>

<p>However, an FTB top-up or lump sum claim amount, after debt offsetting by Centrelink, may be used by the ATO to offset tax debts if the ATO has not yet issued the NOA.</p>

<p>Services Australia issues the FTB reconciliation top-up payment or lump sum claim amount (if entitled) and issues a letter to the customer to advise the result. If the customer has subscribed to Electronic Message and Reminder Service, an SMS may be sent to confirm a top up has been issued.</p>

<p>Reconciliation letters advise details of any amounts used to offset or repay a Centrelink debt. An account payable will be issued for any FTB reconciliation debt raised for the relevant financial year.</p>

<p>The system calculates a person's annual FTB entitlement for the relevant financial year by applying the actual dates of any changes in the family's circumstances.</p>

<p>To receive their full annual FTB entitlement, income lodgement requirements must be met by the end of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12 or earlier years).</p>

<p>There are 2 main steps, income reconciliation and maintenance reconciliation</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Income reconciliation</strong> for income reconciliation periods where estimated income was used to work out their FTB rate during the relevant financial year. If available, actual adjusted taxable income details are used to work out correct FTB entitlement. Income assessment modes. See the <a>Resources</a> page for further information</li>
		<li>
For any period they were partnered, their and their partner's combined adjusted taxable income is used to work out the correct FTB rate. FTB Part A is not income tested for periods during which they or their partner received an income support payment above nil rate. FTB Part B is income tested for all partnered periods. See <a href="../families/007-07070010-01.html">Effect of income support entitlement on FTB</a></li>
		<li>
<a href="../families/007-11010090-01.html">Special processing rules apply for ex-partners</a></li>
		<li>
If they or their partner returned to work after caring for a child during the relevant financial year, FTB Part B may be paid free of the secondary earner income test for the period before the return to work. See <a href="../families/007-11010060-01.html">FTB Part B quarantine and the reconciliation process</a></li>
		<li>
FTB entitlement to Part A and Part B supplements and SIFS is assessed during reconciliation once income lodgement and any other required information is available</li>
			<ul>			<li>
From 1 July 2016, an income limit applies for payment of Part A supplement. This limit extends to periods in which they or their partner received an income support payment</li>
			<li>
From 1 July 2017, SIFS is not payable to new customers. Grandfathering provisions apply for existing customers</li>
			<li>
From 10 June 2019, FTB top-up, supplements and lump sum claim amounts will be used to repay outstanding social security, student assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payment debts. <strong>Note</strong>&#58; from this date, offsetting will also apply to FTB instalment arrears payments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Maintenance reconciliation</strong> - <a href="../separated-parents/277-51190000-01.html">Maintenance reconciliation</a> is required if their FTB Part A rate after income reconciliation is above the base rate and they and/or their partner were entitled to receive child support for a child from a previous relationship. If they have a child support entitlement registered for collection by Child Support, they may benefit from the <a href="../separated-parents/277-51190010-01.html">Maintenance Income Credit (MIC)</a></li>

<p>The income assessment mode indicates where the income used in the FTB reconciliation calculation came from.</p>

<p>A different income mode may be used for the customer, current partner and ex-partner. Income of a deceased person is converted to an annualised actual income amount.</p>

<p>Income modes apply at the income component level according to the following hierarchy&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Actual Income (AIN)&#58;</strong> actual adjusted taxable income details that override estimated taxable income, reportable fringe benefits and net rental property losses. A different income mode applies to other income components</li>
		<li>
<strong>Financial Year Estimate (FYE)&#58;</strong> the estimate of income component recorded on the FAO Income for Previous Year (<strong>FIPY</strong>) screen provided in the current financial year but applies to the relevant financial year.

		<li>
<strong>Most Recent Estimate (MRE)&#58;</strong> the latest estimate recorded for the income component up to the end of that financial year on ongoing income screens (for example, FAO Taxable Income screen). For non-taxable pension/benefit, '<strong>MRE</strong>' is the mode used only where the estimate is higher than the actual amount known to be paid. In some cases, the most recent estimate will be a default estimate</li>
		<li>
<strong>Centrelink Actual (CAI)&#58;</strong> the actual amount of non-taxable pension/benefit paid to the person from Tax Cluster details, where this amount is higher than the estimate recorded on the FIPY screen or ongoing income screens</li>
		<li>
<strong>Estimates As Provided (EAP)&#58;</strong> for an ex-partner period only, partial reconciliation and the ex-partner income comparison process uses estimates as recorded on the ongoing income screens during the relevant financial year, applying each estimate from the date of event recorded</li>

<p>FTB lump sum claims cannot be finalised until adequate income details are available for the customer (and their current partner). Lump sum claims must be lodged and income confirmed by the end of the lodgement year (extended lodgement year for 2011-12 or earlier years).</p>

<p>Claims for <strong>earlier financial years</strong> could be granted using actual income details for the customer and estimated income for the partner. If the partner's actual income details were later received, lump sum claim entitlement was recalculated. If their current partner was expected to lodge a tax return and actual income details had not been received from the ATO by November of the extended lodgement year (for example, by November 2011 for 2009-10), a non-lodger debt was automatically calculated for the total FTB paid for the relevant financial year. </p>
		<ul>		<li>
From the 2012-13 financial year a lump sum FTB claim will be made not effective if the claim is lodged late or income is not confirmed by the end of the lodgement year, unless a <a href="../families/007-07030010-01.html">special circumstances extension</a> is granted</li>
		</ul>
<p>From the 2018-19 financial year, a child’s <strong>immunisation status</strong> is checked when the claim is determined. On the date of determination, if the child’s immunisation is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>No</strong> (immunisation requirements are not met), the FTB Part A reduction due to immunisation is applied to the rate of FTB Part A for the entire lump sum claim period</li>
		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong> (immunisation requirements are met), the FTB Part A reduction due to immunisation is not applied to the rate of FTB Part A</li>
		<li>
<strong>Unknown</strong>, the <a href="../families/007-11010020-01.html">FTB lump sum claim will have a status of pending</a> for up to 14 days while the AIR link is attempted</li>
