<p>To support their claim for family assistance, Child Care Subsidy (CCS), Paid Parental Leave scheme payments or for Medicare enrolment, customers can provide any of the following as proof of the child's birth&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
A completed Doctor/Midwife Proof of Birth Declaration on the Newborn Child Declaration (FA081). <strong>Note</strong>&#58; for a FA081 to be used as a proof of birth it must include the unique <a href="../families/007-07030080-01.html">serial number</a>, and&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
for a<strong> hospital birth</strong>, be stamped with an official hospital stamp or hospital sticker that includes the birth mother's name and date of birth. It must also contain the doctor or midwife's name, signature and qualification</li>
			<li>
for a<strong> home birth</strong>, contain the midwife's name, signature, registration, and contact number</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Electronic Proof of Birth provided by participating hospitals as part of the <a target="_blank" href="../your-health/011-44170000-01.html">Newborn Enrolment Trial</a></li>
		<li>
A birth certificate or certified extract. For state/territory issued commemorative birth certificates, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07080000-03.html">Identity documents A to Z</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Hospital birth</strong> - a letter (usually hospital letterhead) from the doctor or midwife who attended the birth or another appropriate hospital representative. The letter must&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
confirm the doctor or midwife's name, qualification, contact details, and</li>
			<li>
has a signature (this may be the appropriate hospital representative or doctor or midwife), and</li>
			<li>
provides the details of the parent and child, and the date and place of birth</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Home birth</strong> - a letter from the doctor or midwife who attended the birth. The letter&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
confirms their name, signature and qualifications, and</li>
			<li>
provides the details of the parent and child, and the date and place of birth<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where a child has been delivered by a midwife, the midwife's registration number is also required</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Freebirth</strong> - such as births attended by a doula. (Doulas are trained non-medical caregivers who provide support to women before, during after childbirth). Parents will need to obtain a birth certificate if a doctor or midwife is&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
not present at the birth, or</li>
			<li>
unable to verify the birth using a FA081 or similar letter<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> evidence of the birth from the doula such as a statutory declaration is not acceptable. (This also includes Live Birth Records registered with third parties, including 'Commonlaw.earth'). This is regardless of whether this evidence is accepted as proof of birth by Births Deaths and Marriages</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Adoption papers that provide the relevant child's name, date of birth and date of adoption</li>
		<li>
Other Australian Commonwealth government document that verifies the child's name and date of birth, for example, a passport or naturalisation certificate</li>
		<li>
Department of Home Affairs data link verification. <a href="../families/007-03010030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Checking_proof_3">Go to Step 3</a></li>
		<li>
Letters from state government departments cannot be accepted as proof of birth for a child as these agencies should have either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the child's birth certificate, or</li>
			<li>
a letter from the hospital confirming the child's date of birth and child's birth parent/s</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>In formal foster care situations, a letter from an agency confirming proof of birth for a foster care child cannot be accepted as proof of birth but can be accepted as proof of a change in care. Formal foster carers are able to access the child's birth certificate from the relevant agency, for example Child Protection Services.</p>

<p>In the event of a newborn child there may be a delay while the relevant agency applies for the child's birth certificate. Formal foster carers should liaise with their case manager/agency to obtain the proof of birth.</p>

<p>It is not appropriate for the foster parent nor the department to contact the hospital where the child was delivered to obtain alternate proof of birth.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> If a pre-birth claim <strong>was</strong> made - Customers can upload acceptable proof of birth documents using <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-01.html">Upload documents</a>. The customer will be required to use the 'Add newborn child' service online or the 'Add child' service via the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to complete their claim. Alternately they can lodged a fully completed Newborn Child Declaration form (FA081) with the back page included.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Add Newborn child service is not available for DAP customers.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> If a pre-birth claim <strong>was not</strong> made, customers can&#58;</p>

claim online and upload acceptable proof of birth using Upload documents, or</li>
		<li>
claim using either&#58;</li>

the Claim for Paid Parental Leave and Family Assistance (FA100) form and include the back page from the FA081, or</li>
			<li>
(for DAP customers) the Claim for Dad and Partner Pay (FA080) and include the back page from the FA081 or other acceptable proof of birth</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>All images uploaded must be clear and legible and must be provided with the child's details and any required claim information.</p>

<p>If a copy of a proof of birth document, for example a birth certificate, is provided, it must be a clear and legible copy. If there are concerns about the legitimacy of the document, a request to provide the original document is to be made.</p>

<p>If the customer advises that the hospital had not issued them with a FA081 at the time of birth, refer the case to Level 2 Helpdesk for further advice before finalising the claim.</p>
