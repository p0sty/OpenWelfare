Scheduled statistical analysis system (SAS) requests produce lists of ABSTUDY Away from Home students. Students must be ABSTUDY (CUR)rent on the first Friday of the relevant school term to be selected in the SAS</li>

An email is sent to all schools/boarding institutions that are required to report student commencement dates in order to receive the first ABSTUDY boarding instalment for eligible students. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the school does not have an email address, the letter is posted to them</li>
		<li>
The letter provides a One Time Access Code (<strong>OTAC</strong>) to institutions to report this information via the Education Institutions eService (the eService)</li>
