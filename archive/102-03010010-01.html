<p>When a customer moves into a declared IM area, they may be profiled or referred for IM if they meet the criteria for an IM measure available in that location.</p>

<p>The location criteria for IM eligibility is based on a customer's permanent residential address (that is, Home or Term address). Therefore it is important to confirm the customer's move is permanent and not temporary to avoid them being incorrectly identified for IM.

<p>Customers may be placed on enhanced IM if their home or term address is in an <a href="../payment-delivery/103-23021342-01.html">enhanced IM location and they meet other eligibility criteria</a>. If customers are only in the area temporarily (for example, they are travelling, attending a funeral or medical appointment), their address must be coded as <strong>Temporary</strong> to avoid being placed on enhanced IM in error.</p>

<p>If a customer wishes to change and/or backdate their address details, evidence supporting the change may be required from the customer before ending participation on enhanced IM is considered. This is to prevent customers from changing or backdating their address details to avoid participation.</p>

<p>Customers who permanently move out of an enhanced IM location will <a href="../payment-delivery/103-23022456-01.html#bp01_L2GT_Permanently_mov01">end participation in the program after 13 weeks</a>. Updating or deleting home or term address details purely for the purposes of avoiding enhanced IM will not automatically end a customer's participation. Address updates done incorrectly in an effort to avoid enhanced IM may result in placing the customer at risk of overpayment for additional payments such as Rent Assistance or Remote Area Allowance.</p>
