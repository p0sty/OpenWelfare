<p>Access the <strong>Review Record</strong> screen in the Participation Compliance Hub to ensure there are 3 applied failures (either 3 applied connection, non-attendance or reconnection failures, or 3 applied No Show, No Pay failures) within the Serious Failure assessment period.</p>

<p>The incident date of the failure is used to determine whether 3 applied failures have occurred within a Serious Failure assessment period.</p>

<p>A serious failure is not applied if 3 applied failures within the Serious Failure assessment period have not occurred.</p>

<p>Circumstances when there may no longer be 3 applied failures in the assessment period include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>A previous failure (or failures) which contribute to the count of 3 applied failures is no longer valid;</strong> for example, a previously applied failure is no longer valid, or can no longer remain 'applied' due to nil or reduced payment in the fortnight in which the failure occurred</li>
		<li>
<strong>Revocation of previously applied failures;</strong> a review of prior failures has occurred due to the identification of previously undisclosed barriers or a greater awareness of the impacts of previously known barriers. The count of failures should occur following this review. For further information, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030213-01.html">Completing a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when the CDP job seeker has had a serious failure reapplied following Payment Pending Review (PPR), the end of the non-payment period is deemed to be the date the CCA was completed. A serious failure period reapplied following PPR will not reset the period under consideration.</p>

<p>Have factors been identified that may affect the validity of the failures applied in the Serious Failure assessment period?</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p>When non-discretionary factors have been identified that result in there being no legislative basis to maintain an applied failure, a Secretary initiated review of the decision is required.</p>

<p>This occurs when a failure was correctly applied based on the known circumstances at the time the decision was made but a subsequent event made the failure invalid. It does not apply to situations when a failure remains valid but factors that have since become known may have impacted the reasonable excuse determination.</p>

<p>For example, a non-attendance failure is applied for failure to attend compulsory provider appointment, but once reporting is completed for the fortnight in which the failure occurred, the CDP job seeker's rate of payment was reduced due to income, making the failure invalid. In these cases, the failure must be revoked as there is no legislative basis to maintain the failure. The serious failure will also be rejected if there are no longer 3 applied failures in the assessment period.</p>

<p>For more information about factors that make a failure invalid under the relevant legislation see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040010-01.html">Reviewing and validating Community Development Program (CDP) Provider Reports</a>.</p>

<p>Has the CDP job seeker had at least 3 valid applied connection, non-attendance or reconnection failures, or 3 valid applied No Show No Pay failures within the Serious Failure assessment period?</p>

<p>The CCA Report forms part of the evidence base used to determine if non-compliance was persistent.</p>

<p>The CCA should identify&#58;</p>

whether the CDP job seeker's mutual obligation requirements were appropriate</li>
		<li>
if the CDP job seeker has circumstances impacting their compliance, and if so how these circumstances have impacted on their non-compliance over the CCA assessment period</li>
		</ul>
<p>The CCA Report may also provide further information when contact with the CDP job seeker's provider was required and it may also specifically indicate whether non-compliance was wilful or outside of the CDP job seeker's control.</p>

<p>If further information or clarification is required the Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer should consult with the CCA Specialist who conducted the CCA.</p>

<p>A serious failure is not applied when a CDP job seeker is not entitled to receive any participation payment in the entitlement period in which the serious failure determination occurs.</p>

<p>Making a determination on persistent non-compliance should not be deferred to a later period simply because the CDP job seeker is not likely to receive an amount of participation payment in the instalment period on which the serious failure decision is made.</p>

<p>When the participation payment is current at the time of the determination, proceed with the decision. If on a later review it is evident the CDP job seeker did not receive a payment for the fortnight in which the decision to apply the serious failure was made, the serious failure will need to be revoked.</p>

<p>If the CDP job seeker's payment has been cancelled at the start of the instalment period in which a determination will be made on persistence, it may be assumed the CDP job seeker will not receive a payment for that fortnight.</p>

<p>The serious failure cannot be 'Finalised Without Penalty' simply due to not receiving an amount of participation payment in the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the CDP job seeker's payment has cancelled from a date other than 'date paid to + 1' and is eligible to receive an amount of participation payment for the instalment period</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker will not be paid any participation payment due to the recovery of a debt or an outstanding compliance penalty amount, as the payment has been received but immediately recovered against the penalty or debt</li>

<p><strong>Overall pattern</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Does the CDP job seeker's compliance history/record of attendance indicate persistent non-compliance? When assessing this history, consider&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
All compliance event investigations, including events applied, rejected</li>
			<li>
Finalised Non-Attendance Reports (NARs)</li>
			<li>
A prior unwillingness to sign or negotiate a Job Plan</li>
			<li>
Attendance pattern in Online Diary, Services Australia Appointment System and Allowable Absences on the <strong>Provider Recorded Information</strong> screen</li>		</ul>
		<li>
How well has the CDP job seeker complied with their requirements overall, that is, in terms of the overall level of requirements and general pattern of attendance?</li>
		<li>
The CDP job seeker may have met some of their requirements over the period, but their instances of non-compliance may outweigh the instances of compliance, which may indicate they have demonstrated a pattern of sustained non-compliance</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> finalised NARs will not contribute to an automatic CCA being triggered but should be considered when assessing whether non-compliance has been persistent.</p>

<p><strong>Non-compliance within a short time frame</strong></p>

<p>Consecutive failures within a short timeframe might not be sufficient evidence of persistence, particularly if this is the CDP job seeker's first CCA.</p>

<p><strong>All</strong> of the following needs to be taken into account in the determination of persistence&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether this is the CDP job seeker's first CCA (within the last 12 months)</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker's overall intent for example, if they have clearly advised they understood what was required of them but clearly had no intention of attending their appointments, (despite the CCA having been triggered within a short time frame), persistent non-compliance can still be found to have occurred</li>
		<li>
the CDP job seeker had previously been advised/reminded of their mutual obligation requirements, expectations and potential consequences</li>
		<li>
when evidence exists that a CDP job seeker has previously received multiple compliance warnings, consecutive days of non-attendance should not be used as a reason for 'automatically' finding the pattern of non-compliance 'not persistent'. This is because expectations and potential consequences have previously and repeatedly been reinforced with the CDP job seeker</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Recent compliance history</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
The CDP job seeker may have incurred several recent compliance actions, but their recent compliance history indicates a willingness to comply with requirements and look for work - so persistent non-compliance may not be clearly demonstrated</li>		</ul>

<p>If sufficient evidence exists to finalise the serious failure decision without penalty, the PST-skilled Service Officer does not need to wait until the ESAt referral has been finalised.</p>

<p>When the PST-skilled Service Officer considers there is sufficient evidence of persistent non-compliance and an ESAt is outstanding, the serious failure determination must be held pending the outcome of the ESAt. This is to ensure the ESAt findings can be adequately taken into consideration.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may be appropriate to withdraw the ESAt flag. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330050-01.html">Actioning a pending Job Seeker Snapshot initiated Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) activity</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Is there sufficient evidence to finalise the serious failure without penalty or has the flag now been removed?</p>

<strong>Yes</strong>, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10110000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Finalising_a_pe_Step01">Table 2</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, 'save and exit' the workflow using the reason 'Pending JCA referral for identified barriers' and hold the activity in the CCAEVD position until the day after the scheduled ESAt appointment. Procedure ends here</li>		</ul>

whether or not there were enough substantiating (applied) failures, and</li>
		<li>
the grounds or considerations for determining the non-compliance were not persistent, for example&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the CDP job seeker's non-compliance was directly impacted by their capacity (that is, due to identified circumstances impacting compliance), and therefore non-compliance is not considered intentional, reckless or negligent</li>
			<li>
the substantiating failures provided the only opportunity for reinforcing expectations and advising consequences of repeated non-compliance with the CDP job seeker (both during and prior to the CCA assessment period) and were treated as a single event, or</li>
			<li>
there is no pattern of sustained non-compliance, for example the number of instances of compliance clearly outweighed the number of instances of non-compliance</li>

<p>When a decision has been made to apply a serious failure, the following questions will be presented on the <strong>Decision</strong> screen to assist in determining whether a hardship waiver is applicable under serious failure hardship provisions&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Does the CDP job seeker have capacity to undertake a serious failure requirement? <strong>Note&#58;</strong> lack of capacity to undertake a serious failure requirement, which involves attending a re-engagement appointment with their provider, is demonstrated through an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements over the next fortnight</li>
		<li>
Will serving the non-payment period cause the customer severe financial hardship?</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Serious failure hardship waiver applies</strong></p>

<p>If the response to the first question is 'No' and the second question 'Yes', the workflow will select the waiver option as the non-payment period must be waived under the hardship provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Serious failure hardship waiver does not apply</strong></p>

<p>A hardship waiver does not apply when a person has capacity to undertake a serious failure requirement.</p>

<p>When a hardship waiver does not apply the CDP job seeker may elect to attend a re-engagement appointment to waive all, or part of, the serious failure.</p>

<p>For more information when the CDP job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
elects to have their serious failure period waived by completing a compliance activity, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120060-01.html">Waiving a serious failure period</a></li>
		<li>
will be paid a participation payment under hardship provisions, see <a href="../job-seekers/001-10120070-01.html">Serious failure hardship provisions</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>When a serious failure is not waived, the system will 'turn off' form lodgement and the payment status will show as current at zero rate (CZR) when the serious failure penalty period starts.</p>
