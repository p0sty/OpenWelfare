the assessment takes approximately 30 minutes</li>

<p>Participation payments are <strong>automatically cancelled</strong> for reason failure to re-engage (CAN/CDR) if a job seeker does not arrange a Capability Assessment within 4 weeks of the deemed date of notification.

<p>When a Capability Interview is <strong>triggered by the Employment Services System (ESS)</strong>, the <strong>provider will conduct the interview</strong>. In this interview the provider and job seeker discuss and review&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any difficulties the job seeker had in meeting their requirements</li>

the requirements in their Job Plan, to ensure the provider has considered their circumstances and how they may impact their ability to comply</li>

their understanding of the requirement to make prior contact, to reinforce the importance of contacting before the appointment or activity start time if they cannot attend, and</li>
		<li>
the consequences of further non-compliance</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Capability Interview ensures the provider tailors the Job Plan to ensure it is achievable given the job seeker's circumstances.</p>

<p>The purpose of this part of the Capability Assessment is to prompt the job seeker to advise of any circumstances impacting their capacity to comply with their requirements. These may be circumstances which&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are newly identified. The job seeker has not previously disclosed these circumstances to their provider in the Capability Interview or during other contacts, or</li>

<p>Assessing and identifying the impact of job seeker circumstances is a key part of the Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>During a Capability Assessment, PST-skilled staff <strong>must consult with a PST-skilled social worker</strong> if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a job seeker presents with family and domestic violence, or</li>
		<li>
there is a Family relationships/Domestic violence circumstance (FDV) indicator on the job seeker's record</li>
		</ul>
<p>See <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-12080010-03.html">Accessing a PST-skilled social worker</a>.</p>

<p>Consult with a PST-skilled SO5 or PST-skilled social worker if&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the job seeker discloses a circumstance (not FDV), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
help is needed to assess the impact of that circumstance upon their ability to comply with their current compulsory requirements</li>
		</ul>
<p>These consults can be used as evidence to support the addition or validation of most circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum level of evidence</strong></p>

<p>Only circumstances that have been impacted by meeting a minimum level of evidence can be used to determine a job seekers capability during the assessment. If a circumstance <strong>does not</strong> meet the minimum level of evidence and the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
advises they have <strong>previously supplied evidence</strong> to support their circumstance, <strong>check the record</strong>, or</li>
		<li>
believes they will be <strong>able to obtain evidence</strong> to support their circumstance, <strong>give them an opportunity to do so</strong>, or</li>
		<li>
advises they are <strong>not able or are unwilling</strong> to provide evidence&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
update the circumstance status to 'Sometimes impacts ability to comply, requirements reasonable'</li>
			<li>
record 'evidence yet to be provided to assess impact on compliance' in the 'Describe the circumstances' <strong>Free Text</strong> section</li>
			<li>
advise the job seeker that their circumstance will not be able to be considered as directly or significantly impacting their capacity to comply with their requirements</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Contact with the job seeker's provider or other third parties may also be required. Any contact with a specialist provider, or third party can be used as evidence and <strong>must</strong> be recorded on the <strong>Circumstances Impacting Compliance</strong> page.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> every reasonable attempt must be made to finalise the Capability Assessment at the job seeker's initial point of contact. A Capability Assessment can be placed on 'hold' if the job seeker&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is unable to meet their mutual obligation requirements due to their circumstances, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
given the opportunity, can provide evidence that supports the above. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-18030203-03.html#bp03_tbl_Holding_a_Capab_Step01">Table 3</a></li>

		<li>
what requirements the job seeker feels they are still able to meet with regard to that circumstance</li>
		</ul>
<p>Record the date the circumstance started to directly impact the job seeker's ability to meet requirements, that is, the earliest known date the job seeker can identify as being impacted by the circumstance. If the date the circumstance began to impact is prior to the date the Capability Assessment is completed, record additional information to determine if the circumstance disclosed contributed to demerits accrued on or after that date.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> information on the Circumstances Impacting Compliance (<strong>BIJC</strong>) page is shared with the provider. To protect the job seeker's privacy, <strong>do not record sensitive, personal information</strong>. Seek guidance from a PST-skilled Social Worker about how to best document sensitive information (if required).</p>
