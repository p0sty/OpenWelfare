<p>It is determined there is no public transport service available for the journey from Bill's home to the railway station and that the journey made is the most direct to the institution.

<p><strong>FAA to attend testing and assessment exercise</strong></p>

<p>Rhiannon's home is at Port Hedland. Rhiannon is undertaking a testing and assessment exercise at the University of Western Australia in Perth. </p>

<p>The testing program involves a written test and an interview and takes approximately 4 hours. The normal mode of transport for an approved traveller between Port Hedland and Perth is an economy class bus journey that takes 14 hours. </p>

<p>It is unreasonable and impractical to expect Rhiannon to travel by bus for 14 hours each way to undertake a testing and assessment activity of only 4 hours. In these circumstances, an economy air ticket would be approved for Rhiannon to undertake the journey to participate in testing.</p></td>

<p><strong>FAA to attend scholarship interview</strong></p>

<p>Jenny's home address is Geraldton. Jenny has been short listed for a scholarship at Presbyterian Ladies College in Perth. Jenny is required to undertake an interview at the school<strong>.</strong> </p>

<p>The appropriate mode of transport from Geraldton to Perth is an economy class bus journey. Due to the bus schedules, Jenny would have to travel on the day prior to the interview and then return on the day after the interview. This would require meals and accommodation for 2 nights in Perth. Due to Jenny's age, a supervisor or family member would need to also travel to supervise Jenny for the 2 nights. </p>

<p>It is more cost-effective to approve a flight for Jenny to travel to and from the interview on the same day. Whilst the flight is more expensive than the bus ticket, it is more cost-effective when considering the additional costs associated with supervisor or family member travel and 2 nights of meals and accommodation costs.</p></td>

<p><strong>Unreasonable travel schedule</strong></p>

<p>Olivia is 13 years old and lives in Chinchilla. Olivia boards away from home in Townsville. Olivia normally travels to Townsville via a bus between Chinchilla and Roma, and a commercial flight between Roma and Brisbane and Brisbane to Townsville. Changes have been made to the flight schedule which means this route now arrives in Townsville at 10&#58;30 pm. This is considered an unreasonable arrival time for a 13 year old child.</p>

<p>There is not a direct bus service between Chinchilla and Brisbane which supports connecting to a commercial flight for Townsville. The alternate mode of transport is approval of Motor Vehicle Allowance (MVA) for a parent to drive Olivia directly between Chinchilla and Brisbane to connect with a flight to/from Townsville. To ensure Olivia does not undertake travel between Chinchilla and Townsville which arrives at an unreasonable time, MVA is the most practical, reasonable and cost-effective mode of transport.</p></td>

<p><strong>Health issues requiring alternate mode of transport</strong></p>

<p>Michael is 15 years old and lives in Halls Creek. Michael boards away from home to study in Sydney. Michael’s travel normally involves a charter flight between Halls Creek and Darwin and then a commercial flight between Darwin and Sydney. Michael has provided a medical certificate from a doctor outlining that Michael becomes airsick in small planes and has asked for an alternate mode of transport instead of the charter flight.</p>

<p>An alternate mode of transport can be approved for a bus between Halls Creek and Kununurra and then a commercial flight between Kununurra and Darwin. The alternate mode of transport is cost-effective and reasonable in relation to Michael suffering airsickness. </p>

<p>However, depending on flight arrival/departure times in Kununurra, sometimes the connecting bus service arrives/departs from Halls Creek very early in the morning (3&#58;00 am). The bus arrival/departure time is considered unreasonable for a 15 year old student. </p>

<p>Motor Vehicle Allowance (MVA) may be payable as an alternate mode of transport for the parent to drive between Halls Creek and Kununurra to connect with the commercial flight when the arrival/departure time of the bus is unreasonable. Use of MVA in this circumstance is considered an appropriate mode of transport which is reasonable, practical and cost-effective for Michael’s circumstances.</p></td>

<p>Balan has been approved by ABSTUDY to undertake the journey from Sydney to Armidale by train.</p>

<p>After packing everything needed for the move to the residential college in Armidale, even after reducing it several times, Balan has too much luggage to take on the train.</p>

<p>As it is the start of the first year of the course, and these items are necessary for Balan to live at the University, alternative transport services can be approved.</p></td>

<p>Tim and Tom are 15 years old and live in Cairns. They board away from home to study in Rockhampton. Their travel normally involves a commercial flight between Cairns and Rockhampton at a cost of $500 per ticket.</p>

<p>The Travel Management Company (TMC) contacts to advise&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
that due to demand for commercial flights following the school holidays, the students are unable to travel until Friday (Day 5) of Week 1 of the school term. </li>
		<li>
there are 2 charter flight options available that would enable the students to start school on Tuesday (Day 2) of Week 1 of the school term&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a 4-seater charter flight costing $8,000, and</li>
			<li>
an 8-seater charter flight costing $12,000</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Although the charter flight options are more costly than the usual commercial flight, it is considered reasonable to approve a charter for the 2 students in order to prevent missed days of school. It is cost-effective to approve the 4-seater charter rather than the 8-seater charter.</p></td>

<p>The Travel Management Company (TMC) contacts to advise&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
that due to lack of seat availability, Cheryl is unable to travel on a commercial flight until Wednesday (Day 3) of Week 1 of the school term</li>
		<li>
a charter flight is available that would enable Cheryl to start school on Monday (Day 1) of Week 1 of the school term, costing $3,000</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although the charter flight option would enable Cheryl to attend the first day of the school term, waiting 3 days for a commercial flight is not considered unreasonable and so the charter flight is not approved.</p>
