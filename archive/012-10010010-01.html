		<div class="block">

<p>The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) is responsible for managing a number of national accreditation schemes, including the NGPA Scheme.</p>

<p>Under the NGPA Scheme, general practices accessing the PIP and/or the WIP – Practice Stream must be assessed by an approved accrediting agency. The approved agencies are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Australian General Practice Accreditation Ltd (AGPAL)</li>
		<li>
Quality Practice Accreditation Pty Ltd (QPA) – formerly General Practice Accreditation Plus (GPA)</li>
		<li>
The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS)</li>
		<li>
Global-Mark (GMARK)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Advisories for the NGPA Scheme</strong></p>

<p>An advisory is a formal communication issued by the Commission to accrediting agencies and general practices. Advisories provide guidance and direction on the interpretation and/or assessment s under the NGPA Scheme. Advisories are periodically reviewed to ensure they remain current. </p>

<p>More information is available on the <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">Commission’s website</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Practices participating in the PIP and/or WIP – Practice Stream must be <strong>accredited or registered for accreditation </strong>to be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Registered for accreditation</strong> – a practice is registered for accreditation with an accrediting agency and working to meet the requirements of the RACGP Standards for general practices. If registered for accreditation, practices must achieve accreditation within 12 months of being approved the PIP/WIP– Practice Stream to remain eligible for payments. If the practice participates in the WIP-Practice Stream and is PIP consenting, the 12-month period is from the approval date in PIP, unless the approval date in WIP – Practice Stream is earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Accredited</strong> - independent recognition that a practice meets the requirements of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Standards for general practices.</p>

<p>Accreditation must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
meet the RACGP Standards for general practices</li>
		<li>
be provided by an approved accrediting agency approved under the <a href="../health-professionals/012-10010010-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">National General Practice Accreditation Scheme</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Other types of practice accreditation, such as Medical Deputising Services (MDS) and After Hours Medical Services, are not eligible.</p>

<p>Practices must be accredited  at the point in time date of each relevant payment quarter to be eligible for the quarterly payment. The point in time date is the last day of the month before the quarterly payment.</p>

<p><strong>For example&#58;</strong></p>

<p>A practice was approved for the PIP on 29 July 2022 and was registered for accreditation. The practice must achieve accreditation within 12 months (29 July 2023) to remain in the program. They did not achieve accreditation until 10 August 2023.</p>

<p>The practice is <strong>not eligible</strong> for the August 2023 quarterly payments. </p>

<p>This is because the point in time date for the August 2023 payment quarter is <strong>31 July 2023</strong>. The practice was not accredited on this date.</p>

<p>Accreditation data from accrediting agencies will be uploaded into PIP and WIP – Practice Stream Online systems on a monthly basis. This upload does not include registered for accreditation data.

<p>Practices seeking extensions must contact their accrediting agency and provide evidence of their extenuating circumstances for assessment. Accrediting agencies must refer all requests for extensions to the Commission. Neither Services Australia nor the accrediting agency have the authority to grant extensions.</p>

<p>Practices that have not allowed sufficient time to finalise administration of accreditation decisions will not be given an extension to their accreditation. Accrediting agencies cannot backdate or change the date of commencement for the new cycle to maintain continuous accreditation.</p>
