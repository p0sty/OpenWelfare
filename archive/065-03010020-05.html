Identified Indigenous customers will not have their payments suspended in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the CP customer is within a 14 week bereavement period consider not transferring the customer from CP to Age Pension until after this date. If the Transfer to Age Pension is lodged around 1 July, Service Officers should wait until after 1 July to transfer to Age Pension. This makes sure the carer is paid the annual <a href="../carers/009-07010000-01.html">Carer Supplement (CS)</a> payment. This also applies if they are in the 14 week extension of CP when the care receiver has permanently entered an institution.</p>

<p><strong>Disability Support Pension (DSP)</strong></p>

<p>DSP has no upper age limit if claimed before reaching Age Pension age. DSP cannot be claimed once Age Pension age is reached as stated in section 28 of Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.</p>

<p>If a customer has returned temporarily to Australia following an extended absence, staff should make sure there is a conversation to determine if they are likely to return overseas within the next 2 years. This should help inform the decision to stay on DSP or to transfer to Age Pension.</p>

<p>If a transfer to Age Pension is not submitted online, via ACC or the Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) is not returned by the customer's Age Pension eligibility date, their (and their partner's) current payment will be suspended. Identified Indigenous customers, with the exception of single DSP customers in receipt of Rent Assistance, will not have their payments suspended in this case.</p>

<p>Once a person transferred to Age Pension, a customer cannot be transferred back to DSP unless there is a review of decision requested. </p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if transferred back to DSP following a review of the decision to transfer to Age Pension, they will retain their previous status (for example, DSP grandfathered group/DSP transition group).</p>

<p>DSP becomes taxable when they reach Age Pension age.</p>

<p>Once a DSP customer reaches Age Pension age, they have access to the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">Work Bonus</a> whether they remain on DSP or transfer to Age Pension.</p>

<p>Payment rates remain the same for DSP/AGE, but there are some additional ‘add on’ payments that are different. For example&#58; Pensioner Education Supplement (PES), change in Rent Assistance (RA) rate due to sharer provisions.</p>

<p><strong>DSP (Blind) customers</strong></p>

<p>These customers are not required to provide any medical documentation to transfer to Age Pension (Blind).</p>

<p>If the Pension Disability Information (<strong>PDI</strong>) screen shows <strong>Y</strong> in the <strong>Means not Disclosed Ind&#58;</strong> field, the customer is exempt from the income and asset test and does not have to advise of their income and assets. Customers who are currently receiving DSP (Blind) free of the means test will be issued a modified version of the SA383 without the superannuation question.</p>

<p>If the customer has a partner who is on or applying for an income support payment (other than Blind), details of the customer's superannuation are needed to determine their partner's eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>DSP is suspended due to returning to work</strong></p>

<p>These DSP customers are eligible to claim Age Pension using the online transfer, via ACC or Transfer to Age Pension (SA383). As their DSP can be suspended for up to 2 years they must be contacted to check all details on their record are still current and a reporting regime considered for employment income.</p>

<p>As qualification and/or pay ability of DSP and Age Pension is not overlapping or continuous in these cases, the transfer provisions of section 12 of the Social Security (Administration) Act (SSAA) 1999 do not apply in regards to backdating of up to 13 weeks. Where lodgement is after the Age Pension qualification date, the start day must be determined in accordance with the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010010-01.html">start day rules for new claims</a>.</p>

<p>Once a SpB customer reaches Age Pension age they will no longer receive separate additional payments of TAL, PhA and/or UA as these will be rolled into the Pension Supplement. This will be paid automatically when they reach Age Pension age.</p>

<p>SpB cannot be paid to people who are eligible to receive another income support payment. As the customer has now reached Age Pension age they must complete and return the SA383 to see if they are eligible for Age Pension. If there is no eligibility to Age Pension they may continue to be paid SpB.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> SpB with TPD or TPP visa type will cancel at Age Pension age as SpB with these visa types is age-limited. (This processing is unrelated to the transfer to Age Pension process.)</p>
