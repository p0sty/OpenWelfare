In most cases, copies of objections and COA applications must be forwarded to the other customer in the assessment. This facilitates <strong>open exchange of information</strong></li>

<p>Child support cases can involve more than 2 customers. Customers can owe child support or an overpayment to more than 1 other customer. Child Support may receive a payment that is not enough to cover all of the debt a customer owes.  In these cases the payment is divided up between the other parties in proportion to the size of the debt they are owed.  This is called apportionment.</p>

<p>Staff <strong>must not </strong>tell customers about ended cases.  This is protected information.</p>

<p>More information about apportionment can be found in the Child Support Guide 5.5.2&#58; Entitlement to payment and disbursement cycle. The Child Support Guide also contains a simple example of apportionment which may help explain the principle to customers.</p>
