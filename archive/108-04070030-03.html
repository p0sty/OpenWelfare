<p>The principal home and the private land (curtilage) adjoining the home may not be considered an asset under the assets test.</p>

<p>The legislation relating to the assets test assessment for the principal home and curtilage includes a single title rule, a private land use test and a concession known as the extended land use test or extended curtilage.</p>

<p>These curtilage concessions also apply to the principal home if it is held in a private trust or private company. The controller of the private trust or company is to be able to access the grandfathering title concession and the extended curtilage concession on the same basis, as customers who own their principal residence directly.</p>

<p>All new claimants from 1 January 2007, regardless of their payment type, are assessed under the single title rule. The curtilage amount that is exempt from the assets test is limited to the land on the same title document as the home. Where the private land use test applies the curtilage amount that can be exempted is a maximum of 2 hectares. Where the extended curtilage concession applies the curtilage amount that can be exempted is all the land on the same title document with no upper limit.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a single title document may have more than one parcel of land included.</p>

<p><strong>Grandfathered savings provision</strong></p>

<p>There is a savings provision for real estate to allow adjoining titles to be considered curtilage if they were or should have been assessed as such immediately prior to 1 January 2007 under the prevailing policy. The savings provision will cease when the customer's payment is cancelled, for any reason, or the property ceases to be the home. Determine if the customer is better off on the new or old rules before removing the savings provision.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> only customers who meet this savings provision should have <strong>'Grandfathered'</strong> recorded as the Curtilage Type on the <strong>RE</strong> screen.</p>

<p>If the principal home and adjacent land is on 1 title <strong>and</strong> it is over 2 hectares the whole property may be exempt from the assets test if <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria are met&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The customer is Age Pension age and in receipt of or qualified for Age Pension, Carer Payment (CP) or Department of Veterans' Affairs Service Pension and the payment is payable. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where one partner qualifies for the concession, the customer's partner will also qualify, even if the other partner is a social security income support recipient or a Department of Veterans' Affairs income support recipient who is under Age Pension age or service pension age. If the relationship status should change in the future (for example separation or becomes a widow/widower) the partner's concession will be saved providing they continue to live in the home and are making effective use of the land</li>
		<li>
The customer has had a long term 20 year continuous attachment to the land as their principal home (temporary absences of <strong>less than</strong> 12 months do not break the 20 year period) <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> for partnered customers, the Age Pension or Carer payment recipient of Age Pension age is required to be the person who has the long term (20 years or more) continuous attachment to the land, not the partner who is under Age Pension age or service pension age</li>
		<li>
The customer is making effective use of productive land to generate income, taking into consideration their capacity to do so. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> unlike the private land use test, this means there is no requirement that the land be used for private or domestic purposes. The <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04070030-05.html">Resources</a> page provides additional information and examples of effective use of productive land</li>

<p>Where the extended land use test does not apply, the private land use test is applied where the principal home and adjacent land are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
on 1 title document, and</li>
		<li>
the land is used primarily for private or domestic purposes</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer satisfies the private land test, the principal home and land (on the 1 title document) up to 2 hectares is exempt from the assets test. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> a title document may have more than 1 parcel of land included.</p>

<p>A house and curtilage assessment is not applicable if the customer's principal home is on a single title which is less than 2 hectares. If this is the case, the principal home is exempt from assessment and does not need to be recorded on the customer's record <strong>except</strong> if it is related to a business, trust or company.</p>

<p>If the home property is greater than 2 hectares and the extended land use test criteria do not apply, an assessment of the house and curtilage is required. To determine the value of any excess land, the real estate form (Mod R) provides values for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the home and curtilage</li>
		<li>
the home and surrounding title. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07100130-01.html">Assessing and coding real estate details</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>Any adjoining land on a separate title will be an assessable asset. </p>

<p>Three exceptions exist to the rule requiring land adjacent to the principal home to be held on one title document. </p>

<p>Under the 3 exceptions land held on more than one title document can be treated as if it were held on the same title document as the person's dwelling-house. </p>

<p>The exceptions are&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
where the dwelling-house is located on both blocks of land </li>
		<li>
where all or part of the blocks of land are protected by a law because of the land's natural, historic or Indigenous heritage, or </li>
		<li>
where the alienation (sale) of one of the blocks would seriously undermine the function of the house as a dwelling. </li>

<p>Grandfathered savings provisions apply to 2 groups of customers for principal home and curtilage assessments made prior to 1 January 2007 where the home title is less than 2 hectares in size. These are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
When a customer's home property is made up of more than 1 title but they have been assessed as if it was 1 title and given a 2 hectare exemption</li>
		<li>
When the customer has been assessed under the single title rule prior to 1 January 2007 and thus have less than 2 hectares allowed as curtilage. Customers in this group can contact Services Australia at any time into the future and ask to have the 'old' 2 hectare exemption applied to them even though the land is on more than 1 title. The grandfathering provision can apply if they would have received an increase in payment if the 1 title rule had not been applied.

<p>Establishing a net market value of a new or unrecorded property.</p>

<p>Where the customer advises of a new real estate asset a net market value of the customer's real estate must be established by issuing the customer with the following forms&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Real Estate form (MOD R). Only one MOD R needs to be issued where there are multiple titles that are adjoining</li>
		<li>
Business Details form (MOD F). <strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the customer's real estate is used for business purposes a MOD F and a MOD R must be issued</li>
		<li>
The Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454) letter is used in conjunction with the MOD R for medium to large farm properties. It collects additional information from the customer for the valuer, to enable them to more correctly value the property from the roadside. Generally, if the property is operated as a commercial enterprise, then issue the Q454 letter in addition to the MOD R. The Q454 is not needed for smaller properties such as hobby farms with minimal farm improvements or bush blocks. Where the whole <strong>property is exempt</strong> because it is the principal home and the customer meets extended land use test the Rural Property Questionnaire may also be useful to determine if the customer meets the effective land use test. If required, issue the Rural Property Questionnaire (Q454) letter</li>
		<li>
Request any relevant documents. A title document <strong>must</strong> be supplied for any home property where house and curtilage applies and the property is made up of multiple titles. Other documents may include latest council rates/valuation, certificate of title, evidence of any mortgage on property or any other title document</li>
		<li>
If the customer's real estate is linked to a business, trust or company, if not already supplied, request a copy of the latest financial statements, including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet or depreciation schedule to show any income or loss generated from the business</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer is in receipt of a Blind Pension, Means Test free, then do not issue a MOD R and/or MOD F, as income and asset details are not required. <strong>However</strong>, care needs to be taken if they have a partner and the partner is not on a Means Test free payment. In this case, details are still needed for a review of the partner's entitlement.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If forms and/or documents have <strong>not</strong> already been provided, issue a request. See <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-01.html">Requesting information (CLK)</a></li>
		<li>

<p>If real estate is linked to a trust or company, see <a href="../business-and-employers/043-04060040-01.html">Real estate owned by a private trust or private company</a>.</p>

<p>Procedure ends here for trust and companies.</p>

<p>New real estate should only be linked to a business where it is unavoidable, for example, a non-primary production business where there is a liability over all business assets (real estate and other) and the value of the net business excluding the real estate are negative. Real estate is not to be linked to a business unless advised and assessed by a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO). See <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05070010-01.html">Identifying and making suitable referrals to the CAO</a>.</p>

<p>Any room located in a customer's principal home, or any part of the property that is used purely for commercial purposes, that is not also used for domestic purposes, is an assessable asset. This could include practitioner rooms for clients or patients located in the home, or leasing a portion of land to a telecommunications company for a tower to be located on.</p>

<p>This should be assessed as an asset of the business, and included and coded as part of the customer's business assessment.</p>

<p>A valuation is not required and the asset <strong>should</strong> <strong>not</strong> be recorded as real estate.</p>

<p>Exemptions from the assets test for house and curtilage may apply if the business real estate is also the customer's principal home and the customer satisfies the extended land use test<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>If income is received from Water Licences/Rights or Allocations it will also be assessable.  The amount to be assessed is the Gross income less any allowable expenses incurred in generating the income.</p>

<p>The risk based model for real estate assessments will automatically assess the customer's individual circumstances and determines the appropriate method of assessment. Depending on the circumstances, the assessment may result in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
acceptance of the customer's estimated value</li>
		<li>
a check of the customer's estimated value, <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>
a formal valuation</li>
		</ul>
<p>A customer is not expected to obtain professional valuations for any asset. However, if a customer provides a written valuation this can be used to determine market value if the valuation was done by a professionally qualified valuer, and conforms to professional standards.</p>

<p>Only one real estate record is required for property containing multiple adjoining titles. Where multiple titles are separated by other real estate, a separate MOD R is needed and a separate record is required for each title.</p>

<p>Where a customer's land and principal home (the whole property) is on the one title document and exempt under the extended land use test, a valuation is not required and the customer's estimate of the value of the property is acceptable. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04070030-03.html#bp03_tbl_Updating_real_estate_Step04">Assessing house and curtilage</a>.</p>

<p>If a valuation is required (customer claiming Pension Bonus or the risk profile has resulted in a valuation and the home property is more than one title) a value will be obtained for the entire property and also for the principal home and surrounding land on one title. It is essential that the Real Estate Valuation Information (<strong>REVI</strong>) screen records the title of the home property.</p>

<p>The assets test exemption of curtilage real estate is applied to the land only and any commercial, farm buildings and/or plant and equipment will continue to be assessable assets. A valuation is not required for these assets. The customer's estimate or balance sheet value of these assets is acceptable.</p>

<p>For manual coding assistance, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07100130-01.html">Assessing and coding real estate details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the following properties are unsuitable for inclusion into the risk based model&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Exempt real estate assets</li>
		<li>
Properties where the house and curtilage value is equal to the market value</li>
		<li>
Real Estate type SCF - Self-Contained Flats</li>
		<li>
Real Estate type OTH - Other real estate assets for example Car Parks, Marina Berths</li>
		<li>
Real Estate owned by a private trust or company</li>
		<li>
Real Estate linked to a business</li>
		<li>
Real Estate that has been gifted</li>
		<li>
If a valuation or review of valuation is required, complete the Valuation Request (SA470) form and submit to the Valuation Helpdesk. The procedure <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130090-01.html">Valuation of real estate and other assets</a> contains a link to the form</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the date of effect of a new valuation is the date on which Services Australia determines the new entitlement. When the valuer advises of a new value for a property that a customer has already told us about, there are to be no overpayments raised against customers who have previously advised us of property ownership unless a person has deliberately misrepresented the details of the asset.</p>

<p>If the customer is claiming Pension Bonus Payment the claim is not to be granted until the completed valuation is returned. For more information, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04130090-01.html">Valuation of real estate and other assets at new claim</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> where the property is made up of multiple titles only one real estate record is created if the titles are adjoining or contiguous. A separate real estate record is required <strong>only</strong> where the additional title/s is physically separated from the home property for example there is a road or other properties intervening.</p>

<p>Where a customer's land and principal home on the 1 title document is exempt under the extended land use test, a valuation is not required and the customer's estimate of the value of the property is acceptable. In this case both the market value and house &amp; curt fields should be coded with the same customer provided figure, and will result in nil net assessable assets.</p>

<p>Any assessable business assets should be recorded as Other Assets on the <strong>REBI</strong> screen. The system is unable to apportion other assets based on the asset ownership percentage coded. These assets will need to be coded as the total amount owned by the customer and partner.</p>

<p>The assets test exemption of curtilage real estate is applied to the land only, and any commercial farm buildings and/or plant and equipment will continue to be assessable assets. A valuation is not required for these assets. The customer's estimate or balance sheet value of these assets is acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>For all updates</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Update the principal home field on the <strong>REBI</strong> screen to '<strong>Y</strong>' (yes)</li>
		<li>
Enter the curtilage type in the <strong>Curtilage Type</strong> field</li>
			<ul>			<li>
PLU - Private Land Use test (for customers assessed under the single title rule)</li>
			<li>
EXT - Extended Land Use test (where the extended curtilage concession applies. That is, the customer satisfies the extended land use test)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Current market value $&#58;</strong> the amount should represent the current value of the whole item of real estate and include the value of any assessable water rights related to the property<br><strong>Note</strong>&#58; the assessment of water assets for <strong>Farm Household Allowance (FHA)</strong> customers is different than the assessment under social security policy, see <a href="../rural-and-remote-australians/002-02050000-01.html">Assessing assets for Farm Household Allowance (FHA)</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>Current house and Curt. $&#58;</strong> enter the value of the principal home and applicable surrounding curtilage. Curtilage amount is limited to land on the same title document as the home, to a maximum of 2 hectares, (but there is no size limit if eligible for extended curtilage concession)</li>
		</ul>
<p>The value of any land attached to the home, which is not regarded as curtilage, is an assessable asset. Only one item of real estate with a home and curtilage amount can be coded for each customer.</p>
