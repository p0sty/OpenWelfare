<p><strong>First Home Saver Accounts (FHSAs)</strong></p>

<p>FHSAs are savings accounts which provided a simple, tax effective way for Australians to save for their first home through a combination of Government contributions and low taxes. FHSAs were exempt from the Income Test and Assets Test for Social Security Payments until 1 July 2015.</p>

<p>These savings accounts were available from 1 October 2008 and were not coded on the customer's or their partner's record. The details were not requested from the customer. Any withdrawals or actual returns paid on an FHSA will not be assessed under the Income Test before 1 July 2015. If the customer declares they have an FHSA they must be coded on the customer record as a financial asset. No overpayment should be raised if the customer declares they have had an FHSA prior to 1 July 2015.</p>

The principal home a customer owns and lives in, is exempt under the Assets Test, no matter what its value is</li>
		<li>
Assess the customer as a homeowner and advise customer their principal home and curtilage is an exempt asset unless a business is being operated from home.

<p><strong>Selling principal home</strong></p>

<p>If a customer sells their principal home, the portion of the proceeds that will be used to acquire another home. For sales&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>before 1 January 2023</strong>, within 12 months, are exempt from the Assets Test for up to 12 months from the date of sale. This exemption can be extended for up to a further 12 months (up to a total of 24 months) if the customer meets certain criteria</li>
		<li>
<strong>from 1 January 2023 onwards</strong>, within 24 months, are exempt from the Assets Test for up to 24 months from the date of sale. This exemption can be extended for up to a further 12 months (up to a total of 36 months) if the customer meets certain criteria</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> payments to customers for homes purchased under the ACT Government Loose-fill Asbestos Insulation Eradication Scheme or the NSW Voluntary Purchase and Demolition Program are to be considered compensatory. The customer should be advised the sum received, less the amount they are intending to spend on a replacement, will not be assessed as an asset or deemed to be earning income. This applies until they have replaced the property, subject to a 12 month limit (unless there is a valid reason for taking longer).</p>

<p>For sales <strong>before 1 January 2023</strong> to gain an extended exemption of up to 24 months for the principal home sale proceeds the customer must have a continuing intention to apply the proceeds of the sale to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate a new principal home and have&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Made reasonable attempts to obtain a new principal home. (This could be to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate their new principal home), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
Been making those attempts within a reasonable period after selling the principal home, that is, within 6 months, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>

Been making those attempts within a reasonable period after selling the principal home, that is, within 18 months, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
Experienced delays beyond their control in obtaining a new principal home</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer must meet <strong>all</strong> of the above criteria to be considered to have made a reasonable attempt to obtain a new principal home. If one criteria is <strong>not</strong> met the customer <strong>cannot</strong> gain an extended principal home sale proceeds exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the proceeds are a financial investment and as such subject to deeming whether or not a customer intends to use them to purchase another home if sold <strong>before 1 January 2023</strong>. For home sales <strong>from 1 January 2023 onward</strong>, the proceeds are deemed at the lower deeming rate only.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary vacation of the principal home</strong></p>

<p>The principal home is exempt for up to 12 months for a temporary vacation of the home from the date of vacation. An additional 12 months exemption may apply if the home was lost or damaged and the customer meets the required criteria. An exemption does not apply if the customer has no intention to return to the principal home.</p>

<p>The extended exemption applies if the property was lost or damaged either before or after 1 July 2007 and is applies to all income support payments. To gain an extended exemption of up to 24 months the customer must have a continuing intention to purchase, build, rebuild, repair or renovate a new principal home, and have&#58;</p>

<p>If <strong>one</strong> of the above criteria is not met the customer <strong>cannot</strong> gain an extended exemption for up to 24 months.</p>

<p>If the customer's absence from the principal home is permanent, the current accommodation will be treated as the principal residence and the former principal home (if still owned by the customer) will be assessed as an asset immediately.</p>
