<p>If the payee believes the payer is not the parent of the child/ren and a child support case has previously been accepted, the payee can request to end the case irrespective of whether or not there is evidence to suggest that the payer is not a parent of the child. Typically, the request is made because the payee accepts that the payer is not the other parent of the child and instead of requiring the payer to take the matter to court, the payee can elect to end the child support case. They can only request to end their case from a specified date that is <strong>after the date the election is made</strong>, which is at a future date.</p>

<p>If the payee requests to end their case against the other parent nominated on the child's birth certificate, there is no requirement for them to have the name removed from the birth certificate to satisfy the maintenance action test. Child Support does not require removal of a name from a birth certificate to end a case and start a new case with a different payer.</p>

<p>In these cases, Child Support staff will advise the payee that Centrelink will only pay the base rate of FTB Part A unless the payee&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
is simultaneously applying against the parent of the child</li>
		<li>
is applying for an exemption, or</li>
		<li>
has applied for an exemption</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, Child Support will confirm whether the customer or their current partner is claiming FTB or whether they are intending to claim at FTB at the end of the financial year. Child Support staff will advise the payee to discuss potential impacts with Centrelink before making a decision to end the case. This may mitigate any unnecessary and unexpected financial hardship for the parent. This may include discussions around whether an exemption may be appropriate.</p>

Replicate the applicable child/ren by coding '<strong>R</strong>' next to the relevant child/ren on <strong>MNGS</strong>, and '<strong>M</strong>' next to the new entitlement group. In these cases, the maintenance history from the previous group does not transfer into the new active group</li>
			<li>
As the customer has lodged an application against a new payer, the child/ren will need to have their maintenance action updated to '<strong>APP</strong>' in the new entitlement group from the date the new application was lodged</li>

<p>If a child support case is retrospectively ended or retrospectively made invalid because the payer is no longer considered to be a parent of a child/ren, consideration needs to be given as to whether&#58;</p>

the payer is considered to be a partner or former partner of the payee’s, and </li>
		<li>
any money needs to be repaid by the payee</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>		<li>

		<li>
is a partner or former partner and there is no court decision under section 143 (meaning the payee is not required to repay the money), the amounts paid are considered maintenance income and should not be removed from the MIT</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the 'payee' is required to repay any amount of child support, (that meets the definition of maintenance income) then the amounts repaid would need to be removed from the MIT in order for the FTB to be reassessed. Only the amounts not required to be repaid should be assessed and recorded. For details on recording the amounts that do not need to be repaid, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130020-01.html">Amending maintenance income details on the Override Maintenance Income (MNOI) screen</a>.</p>

<strong>Child Support Collect customer ends their case and has arrears of child support owing&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
When a child support collect customer is granted an exemption and they have a current collect case, there may be outstanding arrears owing on the Child Support case. Although, customers can no longer ask Child Support to backdate the case end to align with the exemption start date, they can elect to discharge any arrears without having the amount taken into account for the MIT due to the exemption. This effectively means that there is <strong>no requirement to backdate exemptions in these cases</strong> as the customer's FTB entitlement will be re-calculated at FTB reconciliation, based on the actual amount of child support received for all child support collect periods during the financial year</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Private collect customer ends their case and advises they were unable to collect their full child support assessment</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
If a customer has a private collect child support case and there are family and domestic violence circumstances present, it may be appropriate to backdate an exemption. The backdating of the exemption is to offset the effect of child support that the customer was deemed to have received, but may not have received due to family and domestic violence circumstances. This enables Centrelink to re-assess their FTB entitlement at the end of the financial year when their FTB entitlement is reconciled based on the actual amount of child support they received during the period the exemption applies</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>There is no time limit on how far back the exemption can be applied, however there are limits on how far back arrears of FTB can be paid. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070090-01.html">Exemptions from seeking child support for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) customers</a> for further information.</p>

<p>If a debt or arrears are generated by the case end data from Child Support, transfer the MFU to the <strong>Child Support Unit</strong> (CSJ). CSJ will investigate and take any required action.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a child/case end is transferred by Child Support for a Child Support Collect customer on the Disbursement method, the system retrospectively changes the case to Private Collect and applies the full maintenance entitlement amount.</p>

<p>This retrospective change in assessment results in the customer having their annualised maintenance income assessed under the Entitlement Method. In the majority of cases, this will result in a decrease in the customer's ongoing rate of FTB Part A. This change in annualised maintenance income can also invoke Mandatory Continuous Adjustment, causing a further reduction to the customer's ongoing rate of FTB.</p>

<p>This is not caused by incorrectly entered/ended case data or a system problem, however it can lead to an unintended and unexpected reduction to the customer's ongoing rate. Occurrences of this issue must be reported to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for escalation to the Policy (Advice) Assessment Team for a workaround to be considered. The <a href="../separated-parents/277-51130050-05.html">Resources</a> page has a link.</p>

<p>In some cases, maintenance income received after the case end date should not be treated as maintenance income. These cases are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Reconciliation; payments are not deemed as income as they are redistributed within the family unit</li>
		<li>
Death of payer, payments no longer fit the definition of maintenance income as they were not paid by a parent of the child, more likely from the deceased's estate (however, this does not apply to capitalised maintenance, which continues to be assessed)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>The Child Support Unit (CSJ) must confirm with Child Support whether the payee is required to repay any money to the payer before reassessing the FTB entitlement.</strong></p>

<p>If maintenance income had previously affected the rate of FTB and it is no longer considered maintenance income, the general rule is that FTB arrears are payable for the FTB instalment period with the following date of effect.</p>

<p><strong>For Centrelink initiated reviews</strong>, under section 107 of the Family Assistance (Administration) Act 1999&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the review decision is made within 52 weeks of notification of the original decision about the rate of FTB or by the end of the financial year after the financial year in which the child support decision takes effect, full arrears are payable</li>
		<li>
If the review decision is made more than 52 weeks after notification of the original decision about the rate of FTB, and made in a financial year later than the year following the financial year in which the child support decision takes effect, arrears are payable from the beginning of the financial year before the review decision is made</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>For customer initiated reviews</strong> under section 109E of the Family Assistance (Administration) Act 1999&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the review decision is made within 52 weeks of notification of the original decision about the rate of FTB or by the end of the financial year after the financial year in which the child support decision takes effect, full arrears are payable</li>
		<li>
If the review decision is made more than 52 weeks after notification of the original decision about the rate of FTB, and made in a financial year later than the year following the financial year in which the child support decision takes effect, arrears are payable from the beginning of the financial year before the application for review was made</li>
		<li>
In cases where the payer is no longer considered a parent of the child and the payee is required because of a court order to repay child support, full FTB arrears can be paid, where a review has been requested within 13 weeks of the date the customer received notification from Child Support or within 52 weeks of the original decision being made</li>
		<li>
In cases where the payer in a child support assessment is no longer considered a parent of the child due to a court decision under section 107 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, consideration needs to be given as to whether the original payer is considered a partner or former partner of the payee, and whether the payee is required to repay the money to the payer (under a Section 143 order). If the original payer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
is no longer considered a parent of the child/ren and is not considered a former partner, the amounts paid are not considered maintenance income and should be removed from the MIT as they no longer meet the definition of maintenance income (even if the payee is not required to repay the money)</li>
			<li>
is still considered a parent of the child/ren or is no longer considered a parent of the child/ren but is considered a former partner, the amounts paid continued to be considered maintenance income unless the payee is required to repay the money. If the payee is required to repay the money (i.e. due to a Section 143 order), the amounts no longer meet the definition of maintenance income</li>		</ul>
		<li>
if the amounts should be removed from the MIT due to no longer meeting the definition of 'maintenance income' as defined in the Family Assistance Act, full FTB arrears can be paid where a review has been requested within 13 weeks of the date the customer received notification for Child Support or within 52 weeks of the original decision being made</li>
		</ul>
<p>Section 109E(3) of the Family Assistance (Administration) Act can be applied so that there is no limit on the period for which arrears are payable.</p>

<p>If the payer has received Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for any period that child support was paid for and that child support is no longer considered maintenance income because of a child support decision, the payer's DCME, which reduces Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI), will need to be amended.</p>

<p>The result is that the payer's DCME will be lower and the payer's ATI will be higher. The FTB of the payer or their partner should be re-reconciled and an FTB debt may occur.</p>

<p>It is appropriate in certain circumstances to waive some of these debts. The decision as to whether or not the payer must repay the debt should be based on their individual circumstances. The following guidelines will apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the court orders under section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 repayment of the child support to the payer, it would be reasonable to raise an FTB debt against the payer</li>
		<li>
If the court deems that the child support does not need to be repaid because to do so would be detrimental to the welfare of the child, it would be unreasonable to further penalise the payer so the debt should be waived under section 101 of the Family Assistance (Administration) Act 1999</li>		</ul>
