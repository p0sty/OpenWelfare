<p>Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an Exception applies.</p>

<p>Customers with mutual obligation requirements will generally report each fortnight via <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> self-managed service channels (online account, Express Plus Centrelink mobile app or phone self service), in person or in writing (SU19) to be paid JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA).</p>

<p>A JSP customer should be directed to the Services Australia website for more information about employment income and reporting. Discuss self-managed service options and the priority reporting line with the customer.</p>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-18120553-01.html">Reporting overview</a> for information on different reporting methods available for job seekers.</p>

<p>Job seekers (JSP and YA) mainly report fortnightly (2 weekly) unless variable reporting applies. This allows the job seeker to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
inform Services Australia of their own (and their partner's) employment income paid in that reporting period</li>
		<li>
advise of any changes in circumstances</li>
		</ul>
<p>Centrelink Managed job seekers will provide confirmation of any mutual obligation requirements or participation requirements which have been met (unless exemptions exist).</p>

<p>Job seekers can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
view a summary of their due to report dates and reporting periods in their online account. This displays all reporting periods within 12 weeks of the date viewed</li>
		<li>
access this summary by selecting <strong>Income and Assets</strong> &gt; <strong>Employment Income</strong> &gt; <strong>Next reporting periods</strong> from the menu</li>
		</ul>
<p>Job seekers who have provided their mobile number or email address are sent a reminder via email or Short Message Service (SMS) the day before they are due to report.</p>

<p>Centrelink managed job seekers with no mutual obligation requirements (such as income support payment reduced to nil rate) are not required to report mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p>The reporting profile with the more frequent reporting requirement will be applied by service profiling.</p>

has <strong>ceased work. They must be</strong> questioned about any unused leave entitlements or termination payments they have received. If payment has been received and the customer is able to provide the details, update the customer's record</li>

If they are unable to provide details of their unused leave entitlements or termination payments (and they are not available via Single Touch Payroll), an <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060050-01.html">Employment Separation Certificate (SU1)</a> is required.

<p>Any changes to reporting frequency will be actioned by the Service Profiler.</p>

<p>The Service Officer should always advise of new reporting requirements and notification obligations.</p>

<p>Most job seekers claiming for or receiving JSP or YA (job seeker) with mutual obligation requirements are placed on two weekly reporting frequency or <strong>Stimulus reporting</strong>. In limited circumstances, some job seekers with mutual obligation requirements can be placed on a reporting frequency other than two weekly. This is defined as <strong>variable reporting</strong>. Job seekers can be placed onto variable reporting if they meet the variable reporting criteria.</p>

<p>The following job seekers are eligible to be placed on a 4 weekly variable reporting frequency&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
granted with the claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP) exemption</li>
		<li>
participating in the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reporting requirements for job seekers who have current refugee exemptions (including REF and R6M exemption reasons) or with Absence Overseas (AOA) activity will not change. Job seekers with REF and R6M exemption reasons can still be placed on 12 weekly reporting cycle if the exemption period is 12 weeks or more.</p>

<p>If a customer advises part time, casual or full time employment details then variable reporting must cease from the date after the first Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) of the change to their circumstances. When new Single Touch Payroll (STP) employment data is available, customers will be automatically placed on two weekly reporting.</p>

<p>Job seekers on variable reporting are <strong>Statement reporters</strong>. They need to report any changes that affect their payment on the EPED of the period that change occurred.</p>

<p>If a job seeker attempts to report via self service more than 13 days after their due Entitlement Period End Date (EPED), reporting will not be available as their payment has cancelled (DNL – Did not Lodge). The customer will need to contact Services Australia to discuss their ongoing eligibility for payment.</p>

<p>If payment can be restored, the customer can be referred to self service to complete reporting for the outstanding entitlement periods. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-18120545-01.html">Early or late lodgement of job seeker reports</a>.</p>

<p>Encourage the customer to report before 5 pm on the due date to avoid any delay in payment.</p>

<p>Job seekers can correct their and their partner's reported non-STP employment income online if there are changes or an error made in the initial reported income.</p>

<p>When making a correction on the same day as the initial report was submitted, Centrelink managed job seekers are asked if their mutual obligation requirements were met again. The circumstances of the correction may have an impact on these requirements.</p>

<p>Job seekers can correct the non-STP employment income they reported in the last six reporting periods.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> employment income that has been confirmed via the Single Touch Payroll (STP) channel cannot be corrected via self service. Customers must discuss changes and provide evidence to staff.</p>
