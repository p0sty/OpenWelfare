<p><strong>Question&#58; How do I/my kids get an IHI?</strong></p>

<p>You already have an IHI if any of the following apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
you have a Medicare card</li>
		<li>
you have a DVA card</li>
		<li>
you’re enrolled in Medicare</li>

<p>If you’re not eligible for Medicare or a DVA benefit you can request an IHI through the Individual Healthcare Identifiers (IHI) Service in myGov. You will first need to create a myGov account to access the IHI service.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I linked a Medicare account/HI Service/My Health Record to myGov. Why can’t I see anything on the proof of vaccinations?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; When you link your Medicare account to myGov, your proof of vaccinations might not show any information for a few days. You can log on at any time to check whether your record has been updated.</p>

<p>If you think your vaccinations are missing from your record, speak to your vaccination provider and ask them to record them on the AIR.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; It can take up to 10 days for any new vaccinations to appear on your immunisation history.</p>

<p>Making sure your personal and contact details are up to date can help. If you have a Medicare Online Account, you can update your details using myGov or the Express Plus Medicare mobile app.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for Medicare, you can check or update your details with the AIR.</p>

<p>If over 10 days, advise the individual to ask their vaccination provider to send their immunisation history to the AIR.</p>

<p>If their provider has done this already, and it has been a number of days since, it may be a pended record. Check the vaccination record to see if it needs to be updated.</p>

approved or recognised to be recorded on the AIR, and</li>
		<li>
you received it on or after 1 March 2020</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> you’ll need documents in English that show what vaccinations you’ve had.</p>

<p>It is also important that your vaccination provider records the country the vaccine was given. This will make sure that your vaccines are displayed correctly on your proof of vaccinations. If no country is recorded or it is recorded as ‘unknown’, the vaccination won’t display on your international certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Does my vaccine batch or serial number need to be recorded?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Under legislation, it is mandatory that your vaccination provider records the batch numbers for COVID-19, flu and NIP vaccines.</p>

<p>Some vaccines, such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, have a lot number instead of a batch number. The lot number can be entered if there is no batch number.</p>

<p>If the provider does not know the batch number, the will should contact their state or territory health department for those details.</p>

<p>You don’t have to do anything differently. It just means that all your flu, COVID-19, NIP and JEV vaccinations will be recorded on the AIR and show on your immunisation history statement.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can my patient get an exemption for COVID-19 vaccines?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Medical contraindications can be recorded on the AIR for COVID-19 vaccines if there is a valid medical reason as outlined in the Australian Immunisation Handbook. If a medical contraindication is only recorded for 1 COVID-19 vaccine brand, the exemption will only apply to that vaccine. This means they won’t be able to download a COVID-19 digital certificate with a medical contraindication status but it will show on their immunisation history statement.</p>

<p>If your patient can’t receive any COVID-19 vaccines, you will need to record a medical contraindication for each brand on the AIR.</p>

<p>When you log onto the AIR site through HPOS, you’ll see an AIR screen where you can enter your HPI numbers. This is not mandatory information. You can select <strong>Next</strong> to continue to search for a patient on the AIR site.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I’m a pharmacy how do I correctly record COVID-19 vaccines on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; When you give a patient a COVID-19 vaccine, you’ll need to record it on the AIR. It’s important to correctly identify your patient so their immunisation history is up to date. This means they’ll be able to get proof of their vaccinations if needed.</p>

<p>Don’t use the ‘Urgent Clinical Need’ special Medicare number for reporting COVID-19 vaccinations to the AIR. If you do this, the vaccination won’t appear on the patient's immunisation history statement.</p>

<p>To find a record on the AIR, you’ll need your patient’s Medicare card and Individual Reference Number (IRN). If a patient can’t find their Medicare card, they can use the Express Plus Medicare app to view their digital Medicare card.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; Can COVID-19 vaccines given overseas be recorded on the AIR?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; Some COVID-19 vaccines customers have had overseas can be recorded on the AIR. If they’re a brand that’s recognised by the Therapeutic Good Administration (TGA) and they were given on or after 1 March 2020. Customers must provide evidence of the vaccinations and the English translations if appropriate to a vaccination provider in Australia for them to record on the AIR.</p>

<p>Recording COVID-19 vaccines customers have had overseas may give them a COVID-19 vaccination status and help them to access up to date proof of their vaccinations.</p>

<p>It’s important for vaccination providers to record the country code of the country in which the vaccines were given and the vaccine batch number. This will make sure that the customer’s vaccines will display correctly on their proof of vaccinations. If no country is recorded, the vaccination won’t display on the customer’s international certificate and they may not be able to request a certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Question&#58; I’m processing pended COVID-19 vaccine encounters on AIR mainframe. Can I call the vaccination provider to confirm information?</strong></p>

<p>Answer&#58; If contacting a COVID-19 vaccine hub see Questions 9 and 10 below.</p>

<p>You can call all other vaccination providers to confirm critical information needed to process the immunisation encounter to an ‘A’ or ‘Y’ status. This includes information such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the date of service</li>
		<li>
the individual’s name or date of birth</li>
		<li>
vaccine brand and dose</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> changes to legislation make it mandatory for vaccination providers to record batch numbers for COVID-19 and flu vaccines. Service Officers who call a vaccination provider to confirm vaccine information and see a vaccine batch number isn’t recorded, should ask the provider for the details.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> vaccination provider personal contact details <strong>must not</strong> be released to customers.</p>

<p>Information such as the individual’s sex/gender isn't needed to process an immunisation encounter. Vaccination providers can still search for the individual and record additional vaccines for them on the AIR.</p>

<p>AIR Service Officers can view the individual’s record by going to the <strong>YCEI – Individual enquiry</strong> screen in AIR Mainframe.</p>

<p>Answer&#58; Vaccination providers have up to 10 days to record vaccines on the AIR. Making sure their personal and contact details are up to date can help to speed up the process.</p>

<p>When customers first link their Medicare account to myGov their proof of vaccinations may not show for a few days. Encourage customers to link their account early to avoid delays in getting their proof of vaccination once they’ve had a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>The personal details displayed on the International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate must exactly match the information shown on the customer’s passport. Customers can choose to update their personal details to match their passport or can contact the AIR for assistance to update the certificate details.
