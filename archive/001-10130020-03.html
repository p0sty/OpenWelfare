<p>The PST SME is responsible for ensuring the outcome of a review of decision is implemented by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
accessing the <strong>Participation Compliance Workflow Summary</strong> screen via the <strong>Participation Compliance Hub</strong>, and</li>
		<li>
selecting the <strong>failure event date</strong>, and then selecting <strong>Review Decision</strong> on the <strong>Completed Compliance Actions</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the decision to apply a connection failure for non-attendance at a third party provider appointment or failure to enter into a Job Plan, is an <strong>affirmed decision</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check to see if the job seeker has already been re-engaged.<br>If the job seeker has not already been re-engaged&#58;</li>

schedule appropriate reconnection requirement via the <strong>Re-engagement</strong> screen, and</li>

			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If the decision to apply a connection, non-attendance failure or reconnection failure is <strong>revoked</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For a connection failure or suspension failure revoked as being 'invalid', and this was the only valid failure in the failure sequences prior to a reconnection failure being 'applied with penalty', then any reconnection failure penalty amount already recovered must be returned to the job seeker.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the reconnection failure is not revoked, but instead becomes a connection failure</li>
		<li>
For any non-attendance failure penalty amounts already recovered, this must be returned to the job seeker</li>
		<li>
Using the <strong>Review Decision</strong> workflow, update review status and date on the <strong>Review Decision</strong> screen</li>
		<li>
Contact the job seeker&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
discuss and record outcome of review/appeal in the Appeals (APL) system</li>

if re-engagement has not already occurred, re-engage with Employment Services Provider via the <strong>Re-engagement</strong> screen</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Finalise the <strong>Review Decision</strong> workflow</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the <strong>Review Decision</strong> workflow will assist the PST SME to identify when adjustments to penalties are required. In some cases, an MFU will also be created if manual calculation of a penalty amount or arrears is required.</p>

<p>Manually calculate the job seeker's net entitlement for the affected periods. If necessary, correct the arrears or debt amount displayed.</p>

<p>If the decision to apply a reconnection failure penalty is varied and the reconnection failure should be <strong>applied without penalty</strong>, the reconnection failure status should automatically change to 'applied without penalty' as long as the previous failures in the failure sequence have been assessed as invalid. A failure is considered to be invalid if it has been rejected or revoked using one of the following rejection/revocation codes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Returned for update - insufficient evidence/documentation (IVA)</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Updating the status of previous failures</strong></p>

<p>If the rejection reason for a failure needs to be changed to indicate it is invalid&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
go to the Incident Summary (<strong>BIIS</strong>) screen</li>
		<li>
select the <strong>failure</strong>, and</li>
		<li>
'C'hange the <strong>Status Reason</strong> on the Breach Investigation (<strong>BIDE</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>To change the revoke reason recorded for a failure, use the <strong>Review Decision</strong> workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&#58; when the rejection reason is updated on the <strong>BIDE</strong> screen to indicate a failure is now invalid the system may not automatically change the subsequent reconnection failure status from 'Applied' to 'Applied without penalty'. If this occurs, a PST SME is responsible for manually updating the reconnection failure status in the <strong>Review Decision</strong> workflow. This action must only be taken when all the previous failures in the same failure sequence are invalid.</p>
