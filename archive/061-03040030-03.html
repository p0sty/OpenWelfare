<p>Customer wants to increase an absence because of approved study outside Australia.</p>

<p>Study outside Australia as part of the customer's Australian course can only be granted for the length of the course. It is reasonable to allow up to 10 days total additional time (to be included as part of the approved study period) before and/or at the completion of study/work for the customer to prepare/finalise their affairs and travel. Additional travel time may not be added immediately adjacent to overseas holiday period(s). </p>

<p>Ask the customer why they need to remain outside Australia for a longer period. Generally this will only be for an extension of their course but may be for a few extra days to finalise affairs and travel back to Australia. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers in receipt of CP, DSP or PP can also be paid during short holiday periods before and after the approved period outside Australia for a period limited to their maximum portability period, generally 6 weeks. DSP customers are limited to 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period.</p>

<p>A DSP customer may be paid for an overseas holiday before studying overseas, between overseas study periods or after an overseas study period only if the period paid DSP overseas before the holiday (including the approved overseas study period) has not or will not exceed 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period.</p>

<p>Request relevant evidence to be sent to their local Centrelink office.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> proof that the study is part of their Australian course (and not correspondence or external study), including the length of the course overseas, has to be received before proceeding.</p>

<p>Should the additional time overseas for study be increased?</p>

<p>Customer wants to increase an absence because of approved study outside Australia.</p>

<p>Study outside Australia as part of the customer's Australian course can only be granted for the length of the course. It is reasonable to allow up to 10 days total additional time (to be included as part of the approved study period) before and/or at the completion of study/work for the customer to prepare/finalise their affairs and travel. Additional travel time may not be added immediately adjacent to overseas holiday period(s). </p>

<p>Ask the customer why they need to remain outside Australia for a longer period. Generally this will only be for an extension of their course but may be for a few extra days to finalise affairs and travel back to Australia. <br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers in receipt of CP, DSP or PP can also be paid during short holiday periods before and after the approved period outside Australia for a period limited to their maximum portability period, generally 6 weeks. DSP customers are limited to 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period.</p>

<p>A DSP customer may be paid for an overseas holiday before studying overseas, between overseas study periods or after an overseas study period only if the period paid DSP overseas before the holiday (including the approved overseas study period) has not or will not exceed 4 weeks in a rolling 12 month period.</p>

<p>Request relevant evidence to be sent to their local Centrelink office.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> proof that the study is part of their Australian course (and not correspondence or external study), including the length of the course overseas, has to be received before proceeding.</p>
