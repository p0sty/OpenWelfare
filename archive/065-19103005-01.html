<p>The Australian Government contributes to the costs of aged care through subsidies paid to aged care providers. Once a care recipient enters care an assessment is completed. This determines the cost of care. A completed means assessment determines the care recipient’s contribution to the cost based on&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
their income and/or assets, or </li>
		<li>
means not disclosed (MND) status</li>

<p>The fee reduces the care subsidy paid to the provider. This is known as a ‘care subsidy reduction’ (CSR). </p>

Residential care</li>

The CSR applies to the means tested care fee (MTCF)</li>
			<li>
For Service Providers - in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) payment statements for providers this is displayed as a Means Tested Subsidy Reduction </li>

For Care Recipients – see <a href="../older-australians/065-22040400-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Using_the_Fees_">Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) - Care Recipient in Context (CRiC))</a></li>		</ul>

			</ul>			</ul>
<p>For example, a care recipient is assessed as requiring the highest level of care. The provider is eligible to receive maximum subsidies for the care recipient. A means assessment is then completed. This determines that the care recipient is liable to pay $50 per day for an ITCF/MTCF. The care subsidy paid to the provider is then reduced by $50 per day.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances a care recipient’s care subsidy reduction (CSR) can be ‘set’ to zero. The legislation outlines ‘classes’ (categories) of people where the CSR is taken to zero. Where applicable, it also outlines the duration the CSR to zero applies.</p>

<p>If a care recipient’s CSR is set to zero they do not have to pay any ITCF/MTCF for that period. The government will pay the maximum eligible subsidy to the service provider. The care recipient will still have to pay any Basic Daily Fee (BDF) and Accommodation costs (for residential care).</p>
