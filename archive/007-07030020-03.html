<p>PPL is treated as income for customers and/or their partner who are on an income support payments. If an income support payment customer claims a PPL day (or multiple days) in the past, they may incur an overpayment for days they were receiving both of income support payment and PPL.</p>

<p>For PPL claims for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023, PPL days can be backdated up to 100 days in the past (limited to the date of birth/entry into care). This may result in lump sum arrears and the customer may incur a debt for ISP.

<p>JobKeeper Payments were payable from 30 March 2020 to 28 March 2021 and were paid to employees by the employer.</p>

<p>A customer <strong>cannot</strong> receive JobKeeper Payment for the same period they are receiving PPL.</p>

<p>For PPL claims for children born or adopted before 1 July 2023, a customer can select a Nominated Start Date (NSD) for their PPL period that is after their JobKeeper Payment period, <strong>only </strong>where they have not returned to work.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of PPL customers who are eligible for JobKeeper Payment to advise their employers the <strong>start date</strong> and <strong>end date</strong> of their <strong>PPL period</strong> (not the dates PPL was received) to ensure they are not overpaid JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p>If a customer currently receiving PPL advises they received JobKeeper Payment for the same period, advise the customer that they&#58;</p>

are <strong>not</strong> entitled to receive the payments at the same time, and</li>
		<li>
need to advise their employer they are received PPL</li>
		</ul>
<p>Service Officers are not required to contact the customer to discuss PPL entitlement in relation to JobKeeper Payment. JobKeeper Payment does not preclude PPL entitlement, however, PPL does preclude entitlement to JobKeeper Payment for the same period. Customers with queries in relation to JobKeeper Payment entitlement are to be directed to discuss with their employer.</p>

they could still claim COVID-19 Disaster Payment, and </li>

nominate a future PPL period that does not overlap any of their eligible COVID-19 Disaster Payment relevant periods</li>

PPL will auto-reject in most cases, based on details keyed. If the claim is not auto-rejecting because information within the online claim needs to be updated or corrected, staff workflows can be added to update the information within an online claim. See <a href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-06045020-01.html">Social Applications</a>. If appropriate, <a href="../families/007-07030160-01.html">manually reject</a></li>

<p>If an employer determination is made, the employer is responsible for the delivery of PPL. If the employer cannot do this, it will be delivered by Services Australia.</p>

<p>To view employer delivery details, </p>

<p><strong>In Process Direct</strong></p>

<p>Use the Super Key to go to the PPL Calculation Summary (<strong>P1RCS</strong>) screen. The PPL days calculation details summary (<strong>P1RCE</strong>) table will display the Paymaster information (FAO or EMP) for the specific PPL day/s. For more information, see <a href="../families/007-07100010-01.html">Rate explanation screens for family assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme payments</a></p>

<p><strong>In Customer First</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
select <strong>Workspace </strong>&gt;<strong> Claim Contacts </strong>&gt;<strong> Paid Parental Leave claim summary</strong> to access the PPL Claim Summary (<strong>P1CS</strong>) page </li>
		<li>
Go to the <strong>Paid Parental Leave Employer Notified Details</strong> (<strong>P1ERD</strong>) by placing an ‘<strong>N</strong>’ next to the claim to view the employer details.</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer meets the criteria to have their PPL period delivered by their current employer, and the employer has <a href="../business-and-employers/043-02040010-01.html">pre-registered for PPL</a>, an acceptance letter will auto-generate to the employer and the claim will have a status of <strong>PPL/ASS-EIA</strong> awaiting the employer acceptance.</p>

<p>Is  PPL to be delivered by the employer?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, once acceptance has been received from the employer, the customer's benefit status will be updated to <strong>PPL/ASS-PCB</strong> (pending proof of birth/entry into care) or <strong>PPL/ASS-ASD</strong> if the confirmation of birth or entry to care has already been received. The customer's letter will confirm PPL is to be provided by the employer</li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, if  PPL cannot be delivered by the employer, the payments will be delivered by Services Australia. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> requests are received from PPL customers specifying their employer(s) as their requested payer when it has been determined Services Australia will be providing their PPL. Although the customer's employer may not be legally required to provide the customer's PPL, they may elect to do so. Encourage the customer to discuss this option with their employer. The employer must register with Services Australia and opt in to provide PPL <strong>before</strong> the customer submits their claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>For more information about how PPL is delivered to customers by their employer or Services Australia, see <a href="../families/007-09010020-01.html">Delivery of Parental Leave Pay (PPL)</a>.</p>
