<p>Updating relationship details for customers wishing to claim, but not currently receiving Centrelink payments or services is not required. If a new claim for income support or another payment/concession card is being lodged, updates will be done as part of the new claim.<strong> Note&#58; </strong>retrospectively updating a customer’s relationship for a past period where they received the single rate may result in an overpayment being generated as part of the claim. Debt shell activities that generate due to linking a customer to their partner should be left for the Debt Management Team to investigate. See <a href="../debts/107-02010000-01.html">Debt identification</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the partner is in receipt of payments or services, a MOD P is required from the partner whom is required to advise a change of circumstances within 14 days. <a href="../complaints-privacy-and-foi/104-04080010-01.html">A Request for Information</a> can be sent from the partner's record.</p>

<p>If someone not in receipt of payments or services notifies they have become partnered via a MOD P, their record must still be updated. If the contact is by phone, and the partner is present and can provide all the required information, updates can be taken over the phone. If the partner is not present or cannot provide all required information, tell the customer to lodge a MOD P. Confirmation of the relationship is still needed for customers not currently receiving Centrelink payments or services.</p>

<p>Does the customer intend to claim a government payment from Services Australia?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>,</li>
			<ul>			<li>
direct them to lodge a claim online. Partner and relationship details will be captured as part of the new claim. If required for the particular payment they are claiming, confirmation of the relationship will occur as part of the claim process. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07000000-01.html">Claiming income support payments from Centrelink</a></li>

<p>It is possible the MOD P was requested from a customer who asked to cancel their income support payment. If this is the case, the record may still have to be updated to ensure the customer has not been overpaid in the time they have been partnered.</p>

<p>If actioning an adverse MoC decision (a MoC relationship exists) and both the customer and their partner are getting a payment, the 2 records can be linked without a MOD P.</p>

<p>Before updating the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen and linking the records, note the following details&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the partner does not have a record, <strong>do not</strong> create a record for the partner. The linking process will create a record for the partner. Partner’s details will be updated when linking</li>
		<li>
If the partner has a record, check both records for returned MOD P, to make sure the correct date of receipt if used</li>
		<li>
In addition to basic partner details such as name and date of birth (DOB), ensure the partner's Tax File Number (TFN) and correct income and asset details are known before starting to link records. This information may affect the customer and/or partner's payment eligibility and/or rate</li>
		<li>
If the customer's payment status is <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-10040000-01.html">'SUS'pended</a>, check if payment can be restored after the records are linked, noting the customer may no longer be eligible based on partner income and asset tests</li>
		<li>
If linking the customer to a partner they have been linked to in the past, use the partner's existing Customer Reference Number (CRN) to keep any existing links to other departments. For example, to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</li>
		<li>
If the partner's existing record is in a different environment, <a target="_blank" href="../ongoing-contact/102-03020020-01.html">transfer the partner's record to the same environment as the customer</a> for the linking to be finalised</li>
