<p>Go to the Address Details (<strong>AD</strong>) screen and ensure the current home address is correctly recorded.</p>

<p>If the address has been incorrectly ended, go to the Address History (<strong>ADH</strong>) screen and '<strong>D</strong>'elete the line with 'ADDRESS TYPE ENDED'. This will remove the end date from the current address.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> as long as the customer has continued to be qualified and retained payability for their payment during the period of suspension/cancellation, their payment may be restored with full arrears.</p>

<p>This may be the case even when the customer recontacts more than 13 weeks after the decision to suspend or cancel.</p>

<p>This is because the customer would be taken not to have received advice of the decision to suspend/cancel, if they were not at their known address and/or advice of the decision was returned to Services Australia.</p>

<p>This means that the date of effect of the favourable determination (restoration) resulting from review of the decision to suspend/cancel is the date of the original decision (date of suspension/ cancellation), as per the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-05070020-04.html">References</a> page.</p>

<p>Each customer's circumstances must be looked at individually to determine whether they could be taken not to have received advice of the decision to suspend/cancel, and whether they retained qualification and payability during the period, and therefore receive arrears upon restoration.</p>

<p>Does the customer's address need to be updated or corrected?</p>

<strong>Yes</strong>, update address details and reissue returned correspondence. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-05070020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Restoration_and_Step03">Step 3 in Table 2</a></li>
