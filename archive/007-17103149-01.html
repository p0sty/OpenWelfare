Be eligible for <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-17103108-01.html">Child Care Subsidy (CCS)</a></li>

Receiving an ACCS (Transition to Work) eligible payment, including where the payment is suspended or an <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">employment income nil rate period</a> applies</li>
		<li>
Have a combined family income of less than the CCS lower income threshold</li>
		<li>
Meet the ACCS (Transition to work) Job plan requirements</li>
		<li>
Participating in an ACCS (Transition to Work) approved activity, which must also be recorded as a <a target="_blank" href="../families/007-17103115-01.html">CCS activity</a>, for a minimum of 8 hours per fortnight</li>

<p>ACCS (Transition to Work) subsidy is 95% of the fee charged, up to 95% of the hourly rate cap depending on the type of care the child is attending.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, customers may apply for more than the activity tested hours result.</p>

at the time of completing an online or staff assisted claim for Child Care Subsidy (CCS). The ACCS (Transition to Work) application is imbedded within the CCS claim. This means the ACCS (Transition to Work) question set will present if responses in the CCS claim indicate they may be eligible for ACCS (such as being in receipt of an income support payment and report an activity which is an ACCS (Transition to Work) approved activity)</li>
		<li>
<img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> if already receiving CCS, as a standalone application using their online account.

		<li>
in limited circumstances, an offline (paper) FA085 Application for Additional Child Care Subsidy (Transition to Work) form can be issued. See <a href="../families/007-17103149-05.html">Resources</a> for a link to the FA085</li>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers must have an active Job Plan or Participation Plan (where applicable), in place to be eligible for ACCS (Transition to Work). The exception is customers receiving Austudy or means-tested ABSTUDY, because the participation requirements of those payments exceed the activity requirements for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>If a customer already has an active Job Plan in place, there is no requirement to update the Job Plan to include their ACCS (Transition to Work) activity (unless required for the customer's income support payment).</p>

<p>Customers receiving Disability Support Pension (DSP) must negotiate a DSP Participation Plan to meet requirements for ACCS (Transition to Work). If a DSP customer does not have mandatory participation requirements, they will need to enter into a Voluntary Participation Plan. For the purposes of ACCS (Transition to Work) only, verbal Voluntary Participation Plans can be negotiated.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Job Plans do not meet ACCS (Transition to Work) requirements for DSP customers.</p>

<p>Customers have 28 days from the date they apply for ACCS (Transition to Work) to enter into a Job Plan. They are required to contact the agency or an Employment Service Provider (if they have one) requesting they negotiate a Job Plan for the purposes of ACCS (Transition to Work). Job Plans can be negotiated without the requirement for the customer to attend a face to face interview.</p>

<p>However, payment for ACCS (Transition to Work) can only be made once all eligibility criteria are met including having an active Job Plan. If eligible, the ACCS (Transition to Work) date of effect once a Job Plan has been entered into will be the next CCS Monday following the Job Plan negotiation.</p>

<p>If a customer fails to enter into a Job Plan within 28 days of applying for ACCS (Transition to Work), their application will be made not effective and considered to have not been made. If a customer enters into a Job Plan more than 28 days after date of lodgement of their application, even if the application has not been processed, the application will be Not Effective.</p>

<p>The customer will need to lodge a new application. There are no backdating provisions for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>If an individual's income support payment is suspended, they may continue to receive ACCS (Transition to Work) if they meet all other eligibility criteria and are still undertaking their approved activity.</p>

<p>If a customer's income support payment is cancelled, their ACCS (Transition to Work) will also cancel. If the customer's income support payment was incorrectly cancelled and subsequently reinstated, customers can apply for a formal review of the decision to cancel ACCS (Transition to Work). However, if the customer's income support payment was cancelled correctly, the customer will need to make a new application for ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>

<p>If the customer enters an <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010160-01.html">employment income nil rate period</a>, they may continue to receive ACCS (Transition to Work) for an additional six CCS fortnights.

<p>If a customer needs to change their start date, it may be amended to a Monday in a future CCS fortnight. This is only allowed for a change of circumstances and only if no sessions of care have occurred and no payments have been made.</p>

<p>Where a customer has been granted ACCS (Transition to Work) but has had no entitlement for six consecutive fortnights since the start date, and subsequently do not use child care, their ACCS will cancel and they will need to lodge a new application.</p>

<p>If the estimate for the subsequent year is below the actual income from the previous year, Service Officers can request additional information to support the lower income estimate. This is to ensure the customer is not providing a reduced and unreasonable estimate to access ACCS (Transition to Work).</p>
