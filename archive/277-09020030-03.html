<p>A behavioural complete is a complaint about the way in which an individual staff member interacted with a customer. </p>

<p>Customers may perceive assertive behaviour as threatening. For example, a customer may state a Service Officer was threatening in their behaviour because they said they were going to take enforcement action. An appropriate way to respond to this issue may be an explanation of Child Supports, including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
collection and enforcement policy, and </li>
		<li>
the reasons for taking  enforcement action</li>
		</ul>
<p>Level 2 Complaints Officer investigates a behavioural complaint where sensitivity or complexity apply. In these circumstances, the Complaints Officer will listen to the call recording. </p>

<p>Refer all other behaviour complaints to the Service Officer’s Team Leader.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Record Level 2 behavioural complaints using either of the following category and complaint issues&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Quality of Service - Bias</strong></li>
		<li>
<strong>Quality of Service - Lack of courtesy </strong></li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>When a customer makes a behavioural complaint&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
ask the customer for specific examples of what the service officer actually said and how was it said</li>
		<li>
create a <strong>Complaint follow up</strong> intray and forward to the Team Leader of the Service Officer involved for investigation</li>
		<li>
email the Team Leader details of the behaviour complaint </li>

<p>The Team Leader manages the behaviour complaint by&#58; </p>

Reviewing the customer issues</li>
		<li>

<p>When finalising the complaint&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
record the remedy of the behavioural complaint as <strong>REFER TO OWNING TEAM TO ACTION,</strong> and </li>
		<li>
the Level 2 Service Officer records the outcome after the Team Leader has documented their findings</li>
		<li>
continue to manage all other complaint issues raised by the customer </li>

<p></p>

<p>The Team Leader is responsible for the internal process for managing the behavioural complaint. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Feedback for behavioural complaints</strong></p>

<p>Team leaders who manage behavioural complaints about their staff give feedback as appropriate. Documentation in Cuba should only reflect that the customer’s behavioural complaint has been actioned. The Team Leader processes the behavioural complaint outcome in Cuba without finalising the complaint. The Level 2 officer will finalise the complaint in Cuba.</p>

		<ul>		<li>
maintain personal records (including employee records), and </li>
		<li>
collect sex or gender information </li>
		</ul>
<p>The guidelines outline a consistent standard of evidence when gender is being verified or changed. The guidelines also define the gender classifications of male (m), female (f) and non-binary (x). A person of non-binary gender does not exclusively identify as either male or female. </p>

<p><strong>Assisting transgender, intersex and non-binary customers</strong></p>

<p>People who identify with a gender other than the sex they were assigned at birth or who do not identify exclusively with one sex, can request to have this reflected on their records. The Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender have standardised the evidence required for a person to change their sex/gender in personal records held by Australian Government departments and agencies. </p>

<p>When assisting customers to update their gender details, be aware of issues that may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
identification difficulties</li>

the need to address the customer by their preferred name and title in line with <a href="../separated-parents/277-09020030-05.html#bp05_L2GT_External_Websit">Our Service Commitments</a> </li>

		</ul>
<p><strong>Check for Systemic Issues</strong></p>

<p>Check Network News Update (NNU) for issues associated with ATO income transfers and whether there are any bulk fixes or workarounds. The Technical Support Team can also provide information and assistance on systemic issues. Systemic issues have the potential to impact large groups of customers and may create financial hardship.</p>

<p><strong>Implement resolution</strong></p>

<p>An administrative resolution to a complaint will be possible in some circumstances. Such as when an amended adjusted taxable income (ATI) is due in whole or in part to a change to at least one of the 'other income components' of a parent’s ATI. For child support purposes these include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
reportable fringe benefits</li>
		<li>
target foreign income</li>
		<li>
total net investment loss</li>
		<li>
specified tax free pensions or benefits</li>
		<li>
reportable superannuation contributions</li>
		</ul>
<p>Services Australia can amend a child support assessment to use the amended other income components of the parent’s ATI, such as where the ATO amends the parent’s reportable fringe benefits amount. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-07010010-01.html">Australian Tax Office (ATO) income for Child Support customers</a>.</p>

<p>If an amendment of a parent’s income is due in whole or part to a change to at least one of the other income components, complete a correcting errors submission and Cuba Incident Form (CIF)., See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030020-01.html">Correcting a complex Child Support error</a>.</p>

<p>To update a customer's ATI, including another income component, see&#58;</p>

<p>A Complaint Officer does not have authorisation or delegation to override the decision of the original decision maker. However, it may be appropriate to make a new decision if there is new information available. For example negotiate a new payment arrangement or correct an error to finalise the complaint. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a>.</p>

discuss the original decision with the relevant Team Leader, and </li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Team Leader consultation is important when managing complaints from specialist business areas. If the matter is urgent, and the Team Leader is unavailable, make a decision based on the available information. Advise the Team Leader as soon as practicable.</p>

Where a decision is to uphold a complaint, on the basis of an <strong>incorrect decision&#58;</strong>, Consider if it is appropriate to correct the error through an administrative process, see <a href="../separated-parents/277-09030000-01.html">Correcting errors on Child Support cases</a> </li>

<p><strong>Systemic Issues</strong></p>

<p>A systemic issue is defined as being a complex problem, error or unintended outcome that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
has the potential to reoccur, and</li>
		<li>
have a significant impact on customers. </li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>A systemic issue occurs when something is not working as intended, such as&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
systems not working to specification, or</li>
		<li>
policy/legislation not applied correctly</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Officers proactively identify systemic issues and complaint trends impacting customer service. </p>

<p>All systemic issues identified and investigated by MATS staff are recorded in the Systemic Issues Register. Here, staff can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
search for issues</li>
		<li>
register new issues, and </li>
		<li>
contribute supporting information for issues under investigation</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Systemic Issues Register&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
gives visibility and transparency on the progress of escalated items, and</li>
		<li>
demonstrates our commitment to improving customer outcomes by addressing issues head on</li>
		</ul>
<p>View historical issues in the Innovation Hub.</p>

<p><strong>What if the issue or idea is not a systemic issue?</strong></p>

<p>Where a policy, process or tool is working correctly, but does not reflect best practice&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
record the issue in the Innovation Hub, or </li>
		<li>
raise with the business owner as a business improvement opportunity</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The Systemic Issue Team&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
determines if the issue is already being followed up</li>
		<li>
assesses the risk to customers, and</li>
		<li>
enters the systemic issue into the systemic issues reporting tool</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Refer all potential systemic issues&#58;</p>

		<li>
