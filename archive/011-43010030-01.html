<p>This document explains details regarding assignment of benefit forms, account/ invoice and receipt documents for the processing of Medicare claims.</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_Accounts_documents"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Accounts_documents">Account/ invoice documents</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Account documents, for example invoices, claimant accounts, receipts and assignment forms are the most important element in paying a claim. These documents contain essential details when processing a claim for a Medicare benefit and act as evidence for Services Australia. This is why it is essential that the agency retain all documentation associated with claims for Medicare benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Lodgement advice</strong></p>

<p>Lodgement advice is an advice that the claim has been lodged by the health professional's practice on behalf of the claimant. This can also be referred to as a statement of claim.</p>

<p>Where a claimant attempts to claim Medicare benefits using their lodgement advice and/or their statement of claim notice <strong>in person at a service centre</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Service Officers must check the patient's claim history, to see if the service has been assessed</li>
		<li>
If the service has been assessed advise the claimant&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
their claim has already been lodged by the health professional's practice, and</li>
			<li>
they cannot claim the benefit again</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Where the service is not present on the patient's history, process the claim using the details on the lodgement advice</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where a claimant is <strong>not present at a service centre</strong>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
and submits their lodgement advice notice to claim Medicare benefits</li>
		<li>
Service Officers can process the claim and reject with RSN code 162 as a duplicate claim if the service is present on patient's history</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the claim is not present on the patient's history&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
process the claim using the details on the lodgement advice</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Alterations to accounts/ invoices or receipts</strong></p>

<p>Where alterations have been made on an account/ invoice or receipt and the Service Officer is unsure if the information correctly reflects the service rendered&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
contact the health professional's practice for verification, and</li>
		<li>
complete processing notes verifying information</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Service Officer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
confirms with the health professional that the amended account/ invoice is not true and correct</li>
		<li>
they must refer to their team leader or manager for escalation to the Fraud team</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the health professional cannot be contacted, the claim must not be paid. The Service Officer must return the original document to the claimant, together with the appropriate letter. <strong>See also&#58;</strong> <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-23101138-01.html">Quality assurance and quality checking for external mail in Medicare</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Services not claimable for Medicare benefits</strong></p>

<p>Where a service is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
not claimable, Service Officers must return the claim to the claimant, together with the appropriate letter. Copies of letters must be maintained on a dedicated file within the service centre for non-digital claims. See <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-23101138-01.html">Quality assurance and quality checking for external mail in Medicare</a> for more details</li>
		<li>
rejected by the agency, Service Officers <strong>must</strong> retain all paperwork associated with the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43010030-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a link to the Standard Letter Templates.</p>

<p><strong>Accounts/ invoices and receipts requiring additional information</strong></p>

<p>Where the submitted account/ invoice and/or receipt does not include all required details, the claim cannot be paid until the additional details are received&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For <strong>manual patient claims</strong>, Service Officers must try to contact the health professional to ask for more details. If contact cannot be established the claim must be rejected with the appropriate reason code/ letter sent</li>
		<li>
For <strong>digital self-service claims</strong>,<strong> </strong>Service Officers must try to contact the health professional to ask for more details. If contact cannot be established the claim must be rejected with the appropriate reason code</li>
		</ul>
<p>The <a href="../your-health/011-43010030-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Accountsreceip">Process</a> page explains&#58;</p>

<p>Account/ invoice or receipt documents for patient claims require specific details.</p>

<p><strong>Itemised account/ invoice or receipt</strong></p>

<p>If a health professional bills a patient for medical services, the patient requires an itemised account/ invoice or receipt to allow the payment of a Medicare benefit.</p>

<p>Health professionals must provide an account/ invoice, receipt or assignment form that identifies&#58;</p>

<p>Health professionals can create their accounts/ invoices and receipts in a format that identifies the above listed information. As an example, health professionals may include the following to indicate an account/ invoice has been paid&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Nil balance</li>
		<li>
Balance owing $0.00</li>
		<li>
Total Due $0.00</li>

Where an account/ invoice indicates the amount paid is the same as the charge for services rendered, the account/ invoice must be considered paid</li>
		<li>
Printed accounts/ invoice may include charges and fees for prior invoices or upcoming procedures. These amounts/ invoices must not be included when determining if the listed items on the account/ invoice are paid or unpaid</li>

<p><strong>Services rendered to inpatients</strong></p>

<p>Health professionals are required to identify services rendered or requested&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
while the patient was an admitted patient of a hospital, or</li>
		<li>
an approved day hospital facility</li>
		</ul>
<p>Part 3 - Medicare benefits - Division 5 of the Health Insurance Regulations 2018 states that this can be identified by either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the service description, must indicate that the service was rendered as part of an episode of hospital treatment. For example including the word '<strong>inpatient</strong>' in the service description, or</li>
		<li>
a briefer description of the service may be used together with the item number and an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>) or the letter ‘<strong>H</strong>’</li>
		</ul>
<p>The following terms are commonly used to identify these services&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
The letter '<strong>H</strong>' immediately after the item number</li>
		<li>
Including the words '<strong>in hospita</strong>l' in the service description</li>

Including the word '<strong>inpatient</strong>' in the service description</li>
		<li>
Including the words '<strong>admitted patient</strong>' in the service description</li>
		<li>
Including the word '<strong>admitted</strong>' in the service description</li>

<p>Medicare benefits for services performed to an in-patient of a hospital are assessed at 75% of the Schedule fee.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> health professionals are required to identify hospital substitute treatments by including in the service description&#58;</p>

<p>Part 3 - Medicare benefits - Division 5 of the Health Insurance Regulations 2018 states that the below health professional information is required on the account/ invoice, receipt or assignment form&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Notional charges and health professional's discounts</strong></p>

<p>Health professionals may offer a discount to the notional charge stated on the account/ invoice. There are 2 types of discounts that can apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Conditional</li>
		<li>
Unconditional discounts</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the account/ invoice shows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
one charge for the services, this charge becomes the notional charge under which the services are processed</li>
		<li>
individual charges for each service and the health professional has applied&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
an <strong>unconditional</strong> discount, this discount charge becomes the notional charge under which the items are processed</li>
			<li>
a <strong>conditional</strong> discount, the Service Officer must key the full charge, not the discounted amount</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Conditional discounts</strong></p>

<p>A conditional discount applies where the patient must pay the account/ invoice within a specified time in order to receive the discount.</p>

<p>Where the account is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
paid within the specified timeframe, Service Officers must key the discounted amount as a notional charge. The <a href="../your-health/011-43010030-03.html">Process</a> page contains details about how to process conditional and unconditional discounts</li>
		<li>
unpaid and a Pay Doctor via Claimant cheque is to be issued, Service Officers must key the undiscounted amount as the notional charge. See the 'Accounts/ Invoices' section in <a href="../your-health/011-43010000-01.html">Patient claims processing in Medicare</a></li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Unconditional discounts</strong></p>

<p>An unconditional discount applies when the health professional accepts the discounted charge as full payment, regardless of when the account/ invoice is paid.</p>

<p>These accounts/ invoices are usually recognised by wording to the effect 'Medicare benefit will be accepted as full payment' or 'your refund cheque will be accepted as full payment'.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> unconditional discounts where health professionals have indicated that the Medicare benefit is accepted as full payment <strong>only</strong> apply to out-of-hospital services.</p>

<p>By changing the charge to equal the benefit there is no need to substantiate the claim for Medicare Safety Net purposes, as the patient has no out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<p>The <a>Process</a> page contains details about how to process conditional and unconditional discounts.</p>

<p><strong>Rejected items under a notional charge</strong></p>

<p>If an item or items on an account/ invoice where a notional charge applies is rejected, contact the surgery and request an amended account/ invoice that states the individual charges for each item.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers <strong>must</strong> key the rejected item/s as the last service.</p>

		<li>
key either 'MISC', '0000' or '99' for any miscellaneous charges</li>

<p>If an account/ invoice does not contain an item number or a description sufficient to identify the service, it is considered to be a miscellaneous service and <strong>must not</strong> be keyed. The same applies to accounts/ invoice with the wording 'miscellaneous'.</p>
