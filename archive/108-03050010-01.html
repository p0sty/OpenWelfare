	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Information and data is exchanged between Services Australia and DVA. This makes sure the customer, their partner, dependant, and/or carer, get the correct benefit and payment.</p>

<p>A clearance can occur via automated or manual data exchange. Manual intervention by a Service Officer may be required where data cannot be loaded on a record automatically, and further assessment may be needed. This includes where the payment type is not part of the automated exchange.</p>

<p>The clearance process makes sure that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
DVA customer records are identified, linked to or unlinked from corresponding Services Australia records</li>
		<li>
mutually exclusive entitlements are not paid by both Services Australia and DVA at the same time</li>
		<li>
where eligible, a customer can transition between income support payments without interruption</li>
		<li>
payments are coded with correct dates, and rate</li>
		<li>
Services Australia and DVA can recover overpayments</li>
		</ul>
<p>A 'DVA Clearance' refers to when DVA sends information to Services Australia about a grant or change to a DVA benefit. A DVA Clearance is needed for&#58;</p>

<p>A 'DVA Reverse Clearance' refers to when Services Australia send information to DVA about a change to a Services Australia payment or benefit.</p>

<p><strong>The Services Australia DVA Clearance Team</strong></p>

<p>This is a specialist team, which undertakes all work on DVA clearances. The team are the direct liaison point with DVA except for specific work done through the DVA Standardised Service Offer. The DVA Clearance Teams' role includes&#58;</p>

<p>Customers who receive entitlement/s from DVA may not be able to receive a payment from Services Australia and DVA at the same time. Through the clearance process, any Services Australia payment the customer is currently receiving will be reassessed upon advice of payment information from DVA. An assessment is made to determine if the Services Australia payment or benefit should be cancelled. The recording of DVA payments makes sure that any future claims made with Services Australia will have multiple entitlement exclusion rules applied.</p>

<p>Where a claimant receives Veteran Payment from DVA and are notified of the end of their Veteran Payment entitlement period, they may claim with Services Australia. These claims are not to be rejected without the DVA Clearance Team first consulting with DVA, to facilitate a transition to Services Australia payments.</p>

<p>The Veterans' Children Education Scheme (VCES) and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (MRCAETS) are prescribed educational scheme payments.</p>

<p>Customers cannot receive education payments from both Services Australia and DVA, due to multiple entitlement exclusion rules.

<p>The DVA Clearance Team should tell DVA if a DVA student payment recipient receives income support or other Australian Government education assistance payment paid by Services Australia. However, VCES and MRCAETS payments are treated as income only for the following Social Security income support payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Disability Support Pension</li>
		<li>
Carer Payment</li>
		<li>
Parenting Payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>When receiving a VCES or MRCAETS payment, FTB is payable for a child aged under 16.</p>

<p>Payment of VCES or MRCAETS, for a child 16 years and over, will prevent a parent from receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB). Impacted parents will need to consider implications if the FTB child transfers to a DVA education payment. If the child is transferred to DVA and the parent is not receiving FTB for another child, any FTB Rent Assistance will be lost.</p>

SRDP does not automatically satisfy manifest eligibility. See <a target="_blank" href="../people-with-disability/008-03030140-01.html">Disability Support Pension (DSP) manifest eligibility</a>.</p>

<p>WDP payment, paid under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA), may be paid to widow/ers (married/de facto/in a recognised relationship) of veterans, where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the widow/er was wholly dependent on the veteran immediately before the veteran's death, and</li>
		<li>
liability has been accepted for the death as service related</li>
		</ul>
<p>WDP is a tax-free payment that can be paid as one of the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Lifetime fortnightly payments equal to the War Widow(er)s pension provided under the Veterans Entitlement Act 1986 (VEA)</li>
		<li>
An actuarial lifetime equivalent paid as a lump sum, or</li>
		<li>
A combination of fortnightly and lump sum payments</li>
		</ul>
<p>WDP is generally granted with a date of effect of the date of the veteran's death. Due to the complex nature of the claim circumstances, claims may be subject to lengthy backdating, generating large arrears.</p>

<p>WDP recipients are not eligible for a Social Security Income Support Payment due to multiple entitlement exclusion rules. In the case of WDP, the exclusion is for the lifetime of the claimant. They may be entitled to an Income Support Supplement from DVA instead.</p>

<p>For details on WDP, and implications for family assistance payments, see <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-03050010-01.html#bp01_L2GT_DVA_income_and_01">DVA income and family assistance payments</a>.</p>

<p>A customer who is claiming, or already in receipt of, WDP may contact Services Australia to discuss impacts to their Services Australia entitlements. The customer may also contact Services Australia to speak to a Financial Information Service Officer (FIS) about financial information relevant to their entitlements.</p>

<p>WDP customers may also be entitled to receive the following from DVA&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Gold card</li>
		<li>
MRCA Supplement</li>
		<li>
Income Support Supplement</li>

<p>A <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-02010000-01.html">Parental Income Test (PIT) exemption</a> may apply if a parent or guardian is receiving certain DVA payments and&#58;</p>

<p>Services Australia will automatically apply a PIT exemption if the DVA payment information is recorded on the parent's record.</p>

<p>If there is no PIT exemption, the DVA payment may count as taxable income or a tax-free pension/benefit under the Parental Income Test.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>Some DVA payments are included in adjusted taxable income for Family Assistance.</p>

<p>A referral to the DVA Clearance Team is needed when a DVA payment is indicated on a Family Assistance new claim. When the DVA income is coded on the customer record, it will automatically apply the income test exemption to the customer's rate of FTB Part A for customer and/or partners receiving&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Service Pension</li>
		<li>
Veteran Payment</li>
		<li>
Income Support Supplement (ISS), or</li>
		<li>
Social Security Age Pension paid by DVA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers must also include these payments in the income estimate to determine the correct entitlement to <a href="../families/007-07070040-01.html">FTB Part B</a> and Child Care Subsidy (CCS). This means all customers need to provide an estimate of their annual income, even if receiving an income support payment from DVA.</p>

<p>Customers receiving FTB and CCS must also include the following DVA payments when advising estimated Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) for family assistance payments&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
MRCA Compensation payments (tax-free pensions or lump sums), including&#58; Wholly Dependent Partner, Special Rate Disability Pension and Permanent Impairment</li>
		<li>
Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA), for periods before 1 January 2022</li>
		<li>
Invalidity and Partner Service Pensions paid to those who have not reached Age Pension age (not taxable)</li>
		<li>
Adjusted Disability Pensions</li>
		<li>
War Widows(er)'s Pension</li>
		<li>
Incapacity Payments</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>DVA Student Payments, including shared care arrangements</strong></p>

<p>When Veterans' Children Education Scheme (VCES) or Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (MRCAETS) payment is paid for a child, FTB is payable to the parent/carer when the child is aged under 16.</p>

<p>Payment of VCES or MRCAETS, for a child 16 years and over, will prevent a parent/carer from receiving FTB. Impacted parents will need to consider implications if the child transfers to a DVA education payment. If the child is transferred to DVA and the parent is not receiving FTB for another child, any FTB Rent Assistance will be lost.</p>

<p>Where there are shared care arrangements, each parent/carer may choose to receive different payment types for the same child. For example, one parent/carer may choose to receive FTB and the other receive VCES or MRCAETS. Where one parent/carer is receiving VCES or MRCAETS for a child, this does not preclude the other parent/carer from claiming or continuing to receive FTB for this child. Both parents/carers are able to be paid their shared care percentage of the payment they elect to receive. However, the parent/carer cannot receive FTB and VCES or MRCAETS at the same time for the same child.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of Wholly Dependent Partner (WDP) payment arrears and Family Assistance</strong></p>

<p>The WDP arrears must be included as part of the customer's family income estimate in the year that the arrears are paid to the customer.</p>

<p>If a customer elects to convert their fortnightly ongoing payments of WDP to a lump sum, this must be included in the family income estimate in the financial year in which it is paid.</p>

<p>The customer may also receive a lump sum payment from DVA of Additional Death Benefit with their grant of WDP. This is not assessable as income and is not included in the income estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic debt calculation and recovery</strong></p>

<p>If a Services Australia debt results from the grant of a DVA payment, Services Australia transfers the debt information to DVA as part of an automated recovery process. DVA will recover the Services Australia debt from a customer's DVA arrears, and return the information to Services Australia. The details are placed on the customer's debt record, and finalised automatically. If there are not enough funds in the DVA arrears to recover the Services Australia debt in full, the residual amount will remain on the customer's Services Australia record.</p>

<p><strong>Manual debt calculation and recovery</strong></p>

<p>The Services Australia system may be unable to automatically calculate a debt amount due to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a limiting date</li>
		<li>
a cancelled payment record</li>
		<li>
manual rate case, or</li>
		<li>
where conflicting data exists</li>
		</ul>
<p>In these cases, the system will automatically generate a manual follow up for action.</p>

<p>DVA may recover a debt on Services Australia's behalf, see <a href="../debts/107-05080040-01.html">Recovery of debts via the Department of Veterans, Affairs (DVA)</a> for more details.</p>
