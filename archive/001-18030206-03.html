<p>Voluntary unemployment refers to a situation where a job seeker becomes unemployed as a result of a voluntary act.</p>

<p>When determining whether a job seeker voluntarily left suitable employment without a reasonable excuse, relevant matters that must be considered include&#58;</p>

the circumstances that led the job seeker to leave their employment</li>

<p>Dismissal due to misconduct refers to situations where a job seeker has contributed to their unemployment either due to having been dismissed, or been given the option of resigning from suitable work, as a result of inappropriate actions as a worker.</p>

<p>When determining whether a job seeker was dismissed due to misconduct, the relevant matters that must be considered include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whether the employment was <a href="../job-seekers/001-09140000-01.html">suitable work</a>, and</li>
		<li>
whether an incident of misconduct occurred</li>
		</ul>
<p>The investigation does not consider whether the employee was correctly terminated or if the job seeker had a reasonable excuse for the misconduct. This is because misconduct is a behaviour within the job seeker's control and where misconduct has occurred this is never reasonable.</p>

<p>The reason for termination must be a result of misconduct at work and not because of the employee's general behaviour. The incident must have either occurred in their place of work or be directly related to their work.</p>

<p>An unemployment failure has been committed where the job seeker was dismissed from suitable work due to their inappropriate actions as a worker.</p>

<p>An unemployment failure is only a failure under social security law if the work was suitable for the job seeker based on their individual circumstances at the time that they left the employment. Consideration must be given to the job seeker's individual circumstances such as their skills, experience, qualifications and medical history to check whether the work was suitable or not.</p>

<p>Suitable work cannot be more than 15 hours per week for job seekers who have an assessed partial capacity to work, or are a principal carer parent. These job seekers are not required to accept or remain in a job if it involves working more than 15 hours a week.</p>

<p>Where the unemployment due to misconduct was reported by a provider, the suitability will have already been considered by the provider. Service Officers may generally assume that work was suitable for the job seeker based on the report from the provider unless further information provided during the investigation requires further investigation to substantiate the providers assessment of suitability of employment. Where the Participation Solutions Team (PST) determines that the work was unsuitable at the time they left the employment, a failure has not been committed and it should be <a href="../job-seekers/001-10040090-01.html">rejected</a>.</p>

<p>Consultation with a <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-05000000-01.html">specialist officer</a> is appropriate where assistance with assessing the impact of identified job seeker circumstances on the suitability of work is required.</p>

<p>Where the job seeker was receiving payment when the unemployment failure was committed, the payment is cancelled and a post-cancellation non-payment period applies from the date of cancellation.</p>

<p>The date of effect of cancellation is the start date of the instalment period following the date the determination is made to apply the unemployment failure.</p>

<p>The duration of the post-cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks or 6 weeks if the job seeker left a relocation job within the 6 months immediately before the unemployment failure.</p>

<p>Contact with the provider may be required if the job seeker disputes receipt of relocation assistance. Where the provider confirms they have incorrectly reported relocation assistance, a financial penalty for the unemployment failure should not be applied as this will result in an incorrect post-cancellation non-payment period. The failure is rejected as incorrectly reported.</p>

<p>Reinforce with the job seeker their personal responsibility to remain in suitable employment and not deliberately contribute to their unemployment. Advise the job seeker that if their provider decides to report an unemployment failure without the relocation assistance flag, the job seeker will need to recontact Services Australia and a penalty investigation will be completed.</p>

<p>An unemployment preclusion period starts from the date the unemployment failure was committed, which is generally the date of unemployment.</p>

<p>The duration of the unemployment preclusion period is 4 weeks or 6 weeks if the job seeker left a relocation job within the 6 months immediately before the unemployment failure.</p>

<p>Contact with the provider may be required if the job seeker disputes receipt of relocation assistance. Where the provider confirms they have incorrectly reported relocation assistance, the financial penalty for the unemployment failure should not be applied as this will result in an incorrect unemployment preclusion period. The failure is rejected as incorrectly reported.</p>

<p>Reinforce with the job seeker their personal responsibility to remain in suitable employment and not deliberately contribute to their unemployment. Advise the job seeker if their provider decides to report an unemployment failure without the relocation assistance flag, the job seeker will need to recontact Services Australia and a penalty investigation will be completed.</p>
