<p>If the CDP participant's statement is not recorded within the <strong>Compliance Investigation</strong> workflow, the CDP participant must be provided with an opportunity to explain their reasons for current unemployment. The UNPP decision maker is required to talk with the CDP participant before making a determination to apply a UNPP.</p>

<p>If the UNPP investigation forms part of a CDP participant's new claim, service centre Service Officers with a UNPP security resource must consider if the new claim is likely to be granted or rejected.</p>

<p>If the CDP participant's new claim is to be rejected, the UNPP failure must also be rejected. This decision must be recorded in a <strong>DOC</strong>. For further information, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07060060-01.html">Request to reassess a rejected claim</a>.</p>

<p>If the CDP participant applies for a formal review of the decision to reject the claim, or reclaims payment within 12 weeks of becoming unemployed, the UNPP failure investigation is to be regenerated.</p>

<p>Gather evidence of the CDP participant's liquid assets to determine if they would be in severe financial hardship as a result of the UNPP.</p>

<p>Severe financial hardship means the CDP participant has the following liquid assets&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$5,000 where they are a member of a couple, or have a dependent child. This includes the partner's liquid assets</li>
		<li>
$2,500 for all others</li>
		</ul>
<p>When the UNPP is determined while processing a new claim, evidence of liquid assets provided by the CDP participant as part of the new claim should be used when the amounts have been verified. If the liquid assets have only been verbally declared, verification will be required. When the CDP participant is currently in receipt of payment, information recorded on their record and other evidence may be used to determine the level of liquid assets available.</p>

<p>When a CDP participant is re-testing their eligibility under UNPP hardship provisions because they did not qualify for hardship in the first instance due to the level of their liquid assets, the unavoidable or reasonable expenditure for the <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-05020050-01.html">Liquid Assets Test policy guidelines</a> must be applied.</p>

<p>Will serving the UNPP cause the CDP participant to be in severe financial hardship?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Considering_wai_Step06">go to Step 6</a></li>

verifying that the CDP participant or their partner has care of a dependent child based on the family assistance record</li>
		<li>
medical certificate, verification of cost of prescriptions or other medical expenses as well as other essential expenses to confirm that the CDP participant cannot afford treatment after meeting essential expenses</li>
		<li>
medical certificate, doctor's report or psychologist assessment verifying a cognitive, neurological, psychiatric/psychological impairment or mental illness</li>
		<li>
verification of residency in a refuge, social work assessment or other evidence that verifies CDP participant does not have access to safe, secure and adequate housing</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the 'class of person' must be re-established if the CDP participant is re-testing their eligibility for payment under hardship provisions.</p>

<p>The safe, secure and adequate housing provision allows for payment to be reinstated when the CDP participant is at risk of homelessness as they cannot afford their current accommodation and there are no other feasible housing options.</p>

<p>As participation payments are made in arrears, a CDP participant is able to have their payment reinstated at the point their liquid assets are equivalent, or less than, the combined amount of their next accommodation payment plus one fortnightly participation payment at the maximum basic rate.</p>

<p>To establish eligibility under this provision confirm the CDP participant's regular accommodation expenses including the amount payable and frequency of payment.</p>

<p>Examples of evidence for a non-homeowner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Verified details recorded on the Accommodation Circumstances (<strong>AC</strong>) screen. Further verification would be required if the CDP participant asserts that this does not correctly reflect their circumstances, or</li>
		<li>
Rent receipts or a lease agreement or other written evidence of accommodation costs when a formal arrangement exists. A verbal statement from the supplier of accommodation (hostel, boarding house, parents if living at home) will be sufficient for informal rent or board</li>
		</ul>
<p>Examples of evidence for a homeowner&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a recent letter or statement indicating a regular mortgage payment is required</li>
		<li>
when the mortgage is being paid as a line of credit then hardship may be established if a regular payment is required to be paid</li>
		</ul>
<p>Confirm the CDP participant is at risk of homelessness if they cannot meet their regular accommodation expenses. The delegate is to be satisfied the inability to pay accommodation expenses is likely to result in the person's accommodation being put at risk. The amount of information and evidence will vary according to the type of accommodation and the terms the accommodation is offered. It would be expected if the CDP participant has informal accommodation expenses, that is, rent/board paid to family or friends, verification may be required to a greater extent to assure the delegate that the inability to pay is likely to result in eviction.</p>

<p>Determine if the CDP participant has sufficient liquid assets to cover immediate accommodation/living expenses by&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
calculating the liquid assets currently available to the CDP participant and their partner (if applicable)</li>
		<li>
determining the maximum fortnightly payment the CDP participant may receive (basic rate not including add-ons)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Is the liquid asset amount less than or equal to the fortnightly payment amount plus the next accommodation payment due?</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>Yes</strong>, the UNPP can be waived. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Making_a_decisi01_Step02">Step 2 in Table 4</a></li>
		<li>
<strong>No</strong>, then a hardship waiver cannot be recorded at this point. Advise the CDP participant to make contact as soon as their liquid assets fall under this benchmark in order to assess a hardship waiver. The CDP participant should be warned that a reduction in liquid assets will be assessed against the unavoidable or reasonable expenditure test. When a critical or unavoidable expense is not incurred and the assets are depleted more rapidly than allowed, a waiver may not be approved or may be deferred despite the CDP participant not being able to pay their accommodation costs. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-10060040-03.html#bp03_tbl_Making_a_decisi01_Step01">Step 1 in Table 4</a></li>		</ul>
