This does not automatically result in a child support case ending. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-03110000-01.html">Effect on Family Tax Benefit (FTB) where the customer elects to suspend or end a child support assessment</a>. If the customer separates within 6 months of reconciling, the system automatically uses the previous maintenance details.</p>

<p><strong>Case ends</strong></p>

<p>Where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Child Support retrospectively ends a case and</li>
		<li>
the recipient fails the MAT from a date in the past and</li>
		<li>
a negative adjustment occurs as a result</li>
		</ul>
<p>The case should be referred to the <a href="https&#58;//oursites.internal.dept.local/groups/SERVDELOPS/FTFSERVDEL/ONESTSHIMP/L2POL/SitePages/Home.html">Level 2 Policy Helpdesk</a> for resolution.</p>

<p><strong>The system also updates the MAT code according to&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
expected changes, including&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
<strong>F16</strong> (child turned 16 years of age or is under 18 years of age and not in full-time secondary study)</li>
			<li>
<strong>F18</strong> (child turned 18 years of age and is not in full-time secondary study or child is in full-time secondary study but extension of the child support assessment is not sought)</li>
			<li>
<strong>R18</strong> (child is 18 years of age and in full-time secondary study and extension of the child support assessment is rejected)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
other changes recorded (<strong>LCC</strong> - Child Left Care, exempt, <strong>L35</strong> - In care and custody below 35%)</li>
		<li>
information transferred from Child Support. For example, <strong>PPW</strong> (Paying parent workaround) where the customer is 'payer' to the child support case for the child, <strong>CAM</strong> (Child Support assessment made), MAT met per entitlement load and <strong>CCC</strong> (Child Support has commenced payments), MAT met per disbursement load. Child Support also advises if the <a>Child Support case is ended</a> or a <a>child ended in a continuing case</a></li>		</ul>

From 1 July 2008 where the care of a child is shared, Child Support has 1 case for the payee and payer. As a workaround, the '<strong>MWP</strong>' MAT code is used for the payer. This can only be coded by the Integrated Care team or CSU staff. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070080-01.html">Maintenance Action Test for customers with shared care</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Customer claims maladministration</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
where the customer claims they were not aware of the requirement to take reasonable steps to obtain child support because of maladministration by Centrelink. Send a request to the FAO Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for approval to code a <strong>MWP</strong>. This will provide the customer with 28 days to take maintenance action<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when coding an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) decision for maladministration, referral to the FAO Level 2 Policy Helpdesk is <strong>not</strong> required</li>
			<li>
an example may be where the customer was provided incorrect information which caused the customer not to take maintenance action at an earlier date</li>
			<li>
if approval to code '<strong>MWP</strong>' is received from the FAO Level 2 Policy Helpdesk record the '<strong>MWP</strong>'. Send a Q107 to the customer advising of the requirement to take action to obtain child support within 28 days. Create a manual review for 28 days. If the customer has not taken maintenance action, manually update the MAT code to 'NMA'</li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Customer and/or partner is under the age of consent and living as a member of a couple with the other parent of their child, they are not required to take reasonable action to obtain Child Support against that person</strong>, in these cases input&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the <strong>MWP </strong>maintenance action test code (manually coded on the <strong>MNMA </strong>screen) for the relevant child/ren. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120060-01.html">Customer or partner under age of consent with a dependent child in their care</a></li>
			<li>
a review on the <strong>Review Registration</strong> (<strong>RVR</strong>) screen to follow up the customer's relationship status on the date the youngest member of the couple reaches the age of consent</li>
			<li>
a 'Display on Access' (DOA) <strong>DOC</strong> indicating that the customer has had the <strong>MWP</strong> MAT code input because 1 or both of the couple is under the age of consent and the parents are cohabitating but are unable to be treated as a member of a couple due to age of consent. If the customer separates, <strong>MWP </strong>will no longer be applicable and the MAT will apply, it will need to be updated manually from the date of separation</li>
			<li>
when the review matures, contact the customer by letter or phone to confirm their continued living arrangements at that time.<br>If the customer is&#58;<br>-<strong>still partnered</strong> when both parties reach the age of consent - update their marital status. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05010000-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Update_relation">Updating relationship status</a> table in Change in relationship status from single to partnered. Once the marital status has been updated, make sure that any child/ren of the relationship have been placed in a current relationship group. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51050000-01.html">How to group children on a customer's Family Tax Benefit record</a><br>-<strong>no longer partnered</strong> - advise the customer that they are required to take reasonable maintenance action in order to continue to receive more than base rate of FTB Part A. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070000-01.html">Maintenance Action Test (MAT) for Family Tax Benefit customers</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Disputed parentage cases&#58;</strong> in the event that either&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
the 'paying parent' in a child support assessment, has subsequently been confirmed <strong>not</strong> to be the parent of the child/ren, <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>
the FTB claimant's current partner is subsequently proven <strong>not</strong> to be the parent of the child/ren<br>'<strong>MWP</strong>' is to be recorded from the date the customer first became entitled to apply for maintenance from the newly nominated parent. The customer will be required to seek maintenance from the newly nominated parent where possible. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51050000-01.html">How to group children on a customer's Family Tax Benefit record</a></li>		</ul>
		<li>
<strong>Left care without consent cases&#58;</strong></li>
			<ul>			<li>
Use the '<strong>MWP</strong>' MAT code to override <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05050040-01.html">child out of care case ends where Centrelink is continuing to pay Family Tax Benefit (FTB) under left care without consent provisions</a>. Code a manual review for 14 weeks after the child left care to check whether the MWP MAT code should remain in place</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>'MWF' (Manual workaround failed)</strong></p>

<p>Recorded manually. Used when MAT is passed incorrectly, for example, a case has been ended but this information has not loaded onto the system.</p>

<p>Where the customer is no longer satisfying the MAT, this code is input when '<strong>MWP</strong>' was previously coded.</p>

<p><strong>'PDE' (Pseudo DMA Event)</strong></p>

<p>Recorded manually to simulate a DMA (grace) period where the customer meets the fifth criteria of the 13 week (91 day) timeframe as none of the scenarios in the fifth event will auto-trigger the DMA (grace) period.</p>

<p>Service Officers (SOs) must refer the case details to the National ICT Referral Officers (NIRO) via existing NIRO referral protocols. Where appropriate the NIRO will apply the '<strong>PDE</strong>' (Pseudo DMA Event) MAT code to simulate a DMA period for the customer.<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> to refer a record to the NIROs, see Business Processing Branch and select the National ICT Referral Process link in the Featured content section.</p>

<p>The <strong>PDE</strong> code manually initiates a DMA period which will trigger the auto-issue of Maintenance Action Requirement Letters (MARNL) and the creation of reviews.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> '<strong>PDE</strong>' appears on the <strong>MNMA</strong> screen and results in '<strong>DMA</strong>' on the <strong>MNMR</strong> screen. Coding of the <strong>PDE</strong> MAT code is restricted to National ICT Referral Officers and Families Business Division Staff.</p>

<p><strong>'MED' (Manual workaround pass)</strong></p>

<p>Used when the child is in secondary study, but not for CSP purposes. If either of these situations occur, refer to the Families Override Contact/SP to code. In both instances, make sure a clear <strong>DOC</strong> is recorded, outlining all relevant details.</p>

<p><strong>'PRP' (Seeking </strong><a href="../separated-parents/277-51010020-01.html">proof of parentage<strong></a>)</strong></p>

<p>Used as a manual workaround where the paying parent is overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction and the customer has lodged a child support application. This code is used in these cases because Child Support have 90 days to register the maintenance liability in this scenario. Therefore, customers are given 90 days before Centrelink reviews maintenance action in progress. See <a href="../separated-parents/277-51070130-01.html">Action to obtain child support when the paying parent is overseas and the Maintenance Action Test (MAT)</a> for further details of the manual workaround.</p>
