<p>Service Officers and providers are required to determine whether a request to reschedule a RapidConnect appointment is for an acceptable reason. This decision will determine the start date of payment.</p>

<p>When rescheduling the RapidConnect appointment, Service Officers need to ensure that the appointment is made within 14 days from the date of the original Participation Interview is run and the job seeker is advised of their obligation to attend a RapidConnect appointment.

<p>Service Officers must tell the job seeker about their appointment details verbally or in writing, as a letter will not auto-issue to the job seeker from the agency's system for provider appointments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the <strong>job seeker missed their appointment, or, the provider has recorded a result</strong> for the appointment, a new appointment must be booked.</p>

<p>When rebooking the RapidConnect appointment, Service Officers need to ensure that the appointment is made within 14 days from the date the original Participation Interview is run and the job seeker is advised of their obligation to attend a RapidConnect appointment. If this is not done, the <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010010-01.html">job seeker's income support payment start date</a> may be affected.</p>

<p>Ensure that the job seeker is advised about their appointment details verbally or in writing as a letter will not auto-issue to the job seeker from the agency's system for provider appointments.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the customer contacts after 14 days, the entire Participation Interview will need to be re-run.</p>

<p>If a job seeker's income support claim has already been granted (including where the status is current zero rate (CZR)) the RapidConnect appointment is no longer able to be rebooked. The job seeker will need to be exempt from RapidConnect and have an initial appointment booked. The date of effect is either the RapidConnect determination date or the RapidConnect exemption date. The Service Officer will need to contact the provider to request they book this appointment for the job seeker.</p>

<p>Job seekers who are subject to RapidConnect requirements and not referred to the Online Service are required to have an appointment booked with an Employment Services Provider to meet their RapidConnect requirements. Once the job seeker is advised of their RapidConnect requirements, they should ideally attend their first appointment within 2 days, but can be within up to a maximum of 14 days. The day the job seeker is advised of their RapidConnect requirement is counted as Day Zero, with Day One being the following day.</p>

<p>A job seeker subject to RapidConnect and referred to an Employment Services Provider will usually have their payment start date set as the date they attended their RapidConnect appointment, (subject to any waiting periods and qualification requirements being met). The RapidConnect payability start date is displayed on the Job Seeker RapidConnect (<strong>JMRC</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>In Process Direct&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Go to the <strong>JMRC</strong> screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>There are a number of other factors that may impact the RapidConnect payability start date, such as Provider appointment availability and if the appointment needed to be rescheduled. Refer to <a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-05010010-01.html">Calculating the start day general rule</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Once an <strong>attended</strong> result has been entered by the provider for a RapidConnect appointment, a flag is sent to the Services Australia system. This will auto-trigger the job seeker's payment to commence from the correct date.</p>

<p>A JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) record may remain at Current at Zero Rate (CZR) for the reason <strong>Awaiting RapidConnect Compliance</strong> when an <strong>attended appointment</strong> result has been entered.</p>

<p>This may be a result of&#58;</p>

a job seeker fails to attend their RapidConnect appointment, and</li>

<p>Job seekers referred to the Online Services do not need to attend an appointment. They can meet their RapidConnect requirements by agreeing to their Job Plan online. From 4 December 2021, job seekers who are referred to online services under RapidConnect provisions need to complete their Career Profile before they can agree to their Job Plan online.</p>

<p>Their payability start date is usually backdated to the date they submitted their claim (subject to any waiting periods and qualification requirements being met).</p>

<p>When a job seeker is referred to the online service, if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
agree to their Job Plan and a RapidConnect result is not returned or they are commenced from an incorrect start date, they may be eligible for a manual exemption. See <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-17102300-01.html">RapidConnect exemptions</a>.</li>
		<li>
do not agree to their Job Plan within 28 days of the Participation Interview being run, the payment will be rejected and the customer must lodge a new claim. See <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-17102300-03.html#bp03_L3TT_RapidConnect_ex">Cancellation, suspension and rejection reason codes for Newstart System (NSS)</a></li>
