		<li>
QMO must carefully check the customers record to determine if the claim has been finalised by CCRT</li>
		<li>
claims are identified by a CCRT DOA (Display on Access) <strong>DOC</strong>. The outcome of SOI contact will be documented in the Grant/Rejection <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		<li>
QMO must complete QMA per normal process</li>
		<li>
all follow-up actions, including the SOI Workflow, will be completed by CCRT</li>

<p><strong>First SOI - Unsuccessful</strong></p>

<p><strong>DIS Processing Service Officer</strong></p>

<p>Where a DSP claim is finalised during overtime, and the first SOI is unsuccessful, the Service Officer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Should attempt the second SOI later, during the overtime shift, and</li>
		<li>
If they cannot action the second SOI during their shift, or the next day, must ask their team leader to manage the SOI work item</li>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Non-DIS Processing Service Officer</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a Service Officer from outside of a DIS Processing team finalises a claim during overtime, and the first SOI is unsuccessful, they <strong>must</strong>&#58;</li>
		<li>
Make all reasonable efforts to attempt the second SOI during the same shift</li>
		<li>
If working overtime the next day, make the second SOI attempt during that shift</li>
		<li>
If the second SOI attempt is not possible, Unassign the SOI work item for allocation to another DIS Service Officer, using the <strong>Reason</strong> 'Second Contact Attempt Required'</li>

<p><strong>SOI exceptions during overtime</strong></p>

<p>For all claims actioned during overtime (weeknights and weekends) where Social Work assistance is not indicated to be required, Service Officers must review the customer record and determine if an SOI should be attempted outside of normal business hours before finalising claim.</p>

<p>Examples of exceptions where an SOI may not be appropriate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
manifest eligibility (for example, terminal, nursing home level care etc.)</li>
		<li>
it would adversely impact the customers wellbeing</li>
		<li>
bereavement cases</li>
		<li>
clearly documented CRU complaints</li>
		<li>
likely to result in an <a href="../people-with-disability/008-20013032-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Intranet_links">escalation</a> such as media interest</li>
		<li>
if it is clear from the customer record they require an interpreter for Services Australia interactions</li>
		<li>
conflicting time zones - non-appropriate local time zone for customer contact to be attempted</li>
		</ul>
<p>If it is not appropriate to conduct SOI on overtime, DSP claim should not be finalised, refer to <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030150-01.html">Rejecting a new claim Disability Support Pension (DSP) including manifest rejections</a>&#58;</p>

DSP rejection reason is Insufficient Medical Evidence (IME). In this instance, the MAT Assessor attempts the SOI</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers undertaking consolidation must add the following to the claim finalisation notes&#58; '<strong>As part of DSP consolidation, the SOI will be actioned by the Service Officer that submitted the claim.</strong>' This will allow the QMO to easily identify these claims.</p>

<p>If DSP claim is finalised after the QMA check, QMO must action the <strong>Service Offer Interview</strong> workflow. QMO is responsible for completing any follow-up actions as a result of SOI. For example, release of Medical Assessments and request for SME quality checks.</p>

<p>Attempts to contact the customer by phone <strong>must</strong> be made on the same day the claim is finalised wherever possible, to deliver the SOI and advise the outcome of their claim.</p>

<p><strong>Referral</strong></p>

<p>Refer (or offer referral) to suitable employment services for support in retraining and building their work capacity.

focus on connection to the service recommended by the Assessor, such as <a href="../people-with-disability/008-04030110-01.html">Disability Employment Services (DES)</a>.

For example, if the customer has a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC)</a> of less than 15 hours per week, they are not required to participate in employment services but should still be strongly encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis</li>
		<li>
tell the customer their participation and periods of exemption or non-participation in recommended employment services may affect the outcome of any future claims for DSP (this advice must be recorded as an annotation of the <strong>Rejection DOC</strong>). The customer must not be advised a future DSP claim will be automatically successful if they participate in a program. Provision of this information is especially important if the claim is being rejected because the customer has not actively participated in a <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090010-01.html">POS</a> or due to an insufficient impairment rating that may change on appeal or in the future</li>

<p>Examples of exceptions where an SOI may not be appropriate&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
manifest eligibility (for example, terminal and nursing home level care)</li>
		<li>
it would adversely impact the customer's wellbeing</li>
		<li>
bereavement cases</li>
		<li>
clearly documented CRU complaints</li>
		<li>
likely to result in an <a href="../people-with-disability/008-20013032-05.html#bp05_L2LL_Intranet_links">escalation</a> such as media interest</li>
		<li>
if it is clear from the customer record they require an interpreter for Services Australia interactions</li>
		<li>
conflicting time zones - non-appropriate local time zone for customer contact to be attempted</li>
		</ul>
<p>If it is not appropriate to conduct SOI on overtime, do not finalise the DSP claim&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
annotate the <strong>Progress of Claim DOC</strong> indicating that claim has not been finalised because SOI attempt on overtime was not considered appropriate</li>
		<li>
apply any updates through <a href="../people-with-disability/008-18012400-01.html">Selective Application of Data (SAD)</a></li>
		<li>
run the <strong>Streaming &amp; Progress DOC</strong> script selecting the SOI on hold reason (^^<strong>SOI</strong> keyword is applied to the claim activity).</li>

will be granted and an update to their Family Tax Benefit is required, or</li>		</ul>
		<li>
customer (or their nominee) has requested contact about the claim outcome</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the DSP claim has gone to QOL, the SOI should be attempted by the Service Officer who submitted the claim once it has successfully passed.</p>

<p>The Service Officer who finalised the DSP claim is responsible for completing any follow-up actions as a result of SOI such as, release of Medical Assessments and request for SME quality checks.</p>

<p>An attempt to contact the customer by phone <strong>must</strong> be made on the same day the claim is finalised wherever possible, to deliver the SOI and advise the outcome of their claim.</p>

<p><strong>Discuss possible income support payment</strong></p>

<p>This section displays if the customer is not current on an income support payment.</p>

<p>Advise possible alternative income support payments the customer may be eligible for (such as JobSeeker Payment) and explain&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how the customer can claim the relevant payment</li>
		<li>
<a href="../initial-contact-general/106-03040040-01.html">incorrect claim</a> provisions may apply</li>
		<li>
customers aged under 22 assessed as having a partial capacity to work will be <a href="../job-seekers/001-04030050-01.html">independent for Youth Allowance job seeker purposes</a> so the parental income test will not apply</li>
		<li>
how <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> for alternative payments are modified based on JCA recommendations</li>
		<li>
eligibility for <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06050000-01.html">Pensioner Concession Card (PCC)</a> and <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08060000-01.html">Pharmaceutical Allowance (PA)</a> if the customer has a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">partial capacity to work</a></li>
		<li>
the 'claiming DSP' exemption has been end-dated and what this means in regard to meeting mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
if the customer has a dependent child (under the age of 19) in their care and they or their partner are not in receipt of Family Tax Benefit, the customer can use the <a target="_blank" class="extwebsitelink" href="https&#58;//www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/topics/payment-and-service-finder/28656">Payment and Service Finder</a> on the Services Australia website to check their eligibility for Family Tax Benefit</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Discuss referral to Employment Services</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is on a payment which requires participation and work capacity with intervention is at least 15 hours per week, discuss <a href="../job-seekers/001-02060000-01.html">Employment Services referrals</a> and requirements for their current income support payment.</p>

<p><strong>Referral</strong></p>

<p>Offer referral to suitable employment services for support in retraining and building their work capacity. This is particularly important if the claim is rejected because the customer has not actively participated in a <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03090010-01.html">Program of Support (POS)</a>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
focus on connection to the service recommended by the Assessor, such as <a href="../people-with-disability/008-04030110-01.html">Disability Employment Services (DES)</a>. Take into account the customer's participation requirements</li>
		<li>
for example, if the customer has a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070180-01.html">Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) or Temporary Reduced Work Capacity (TRWC)</a> of less than 15 hours per week, they are not required to participate in employment services but should still be strongly encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis</li>
		<li>
tell the customer their participation and periods of exemption or non participation in recommended employment services may affect the outcome of any future claims for DSP (this advice must be recorded as an annotation of the <strong>Rejection DOC</strong>). Do not tell the customer a future DSP claim will be automatically successful if they participate in a program. Provision of this information is especially important if the claim is being rejected because the customer has not actively participated in a POS or due to an insufficient impairment rating that may change on appeal or in the future</li>
		<li>
if an <a href="../job-seekers/001-02330010-01.html">ESAt is required</a> as per recommendation by the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-20102224-01.html">Medical Assessment Team (MAT)</a> or DSP Rejection after a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA)</li>
