<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Principal_carer02">Principal carers have 'part-time' mutual obligation requirements</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>For information on participation requirements for PP customers in ParentsNext, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-03160000-01.html">ParentsNext appointments and processing</a>.</p>

<p>Principal carers on PPS, JSP or YA (job seeker) have 'part-time' mutual obligation requirements. 'Part-time' refers to the ways in which their requirements vary from other job seekers, and the extra flexibilities they are allowed, in recognition of their family care responsibilities.</p>

<p>This is different from the reduced requirements that apply to job seekers with an assessed partial capacity to work or temporary reduced work capacity. These job seekers have variations in their requirements on the basis of medical evidence of their reduced capacity to work.</p>

<p>'Part-time' requirements for principal carers essentially means&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Activities, appointments and other requirements should be scheduled to occur during school hours only (generally between 9 am and 3 pm during school terms), unless otherwise requested or agreed to by the principal carer. This includes participation in employment services and activities negotiated by providers</li>
		<li>
Principal carers are not required to look for full-time paid employment. They must be actively seeking and willing to undertake any suitable paid work of at least 15 hours per week (or 'part-time' work only)</li>
		<li>
Principal carers with job search requirements are not required to accept job offers of more than 15 hours per week. However, a principal carer may accept such a job offer and work more than 15 hours a week. This is about the definition of 'suitable' or 'unsuitable' work for compliance purposes</li>
		<li>
There are a range of other 'unsuitable work' factors that apply only to principal carer parents, including access to appropriate childcare, different travel time and travel cost rules, and a financial suitability test to be applied to the job in question</li>
		<li>
Principal carers can fully meet their requirements through paid work, approved study, or a combination of these activities for at least 15 hours per week (or 30 hours per fortnight). This means they will be Centrelink Managed, and not required to participate in employment services or undertake any job search activities</li>
		</ul>
<p>Although the '15 hour' rule is a common theme for job seekers with part-time mutual obligation requirements, it is not a <strong>maximum</strong> number of activity hours that applies to these job seekers. There are some circumstances where providers can negotiate higher hours with the agreement of the job seeker. For example, where the principal carer agrees to participation in short, intensive, or non-vocational activities/programmes to meet their requirements. Providers follow guidelines on how to set suitable activities and hours for different types of job seekers. These guidelines are set by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for CDP Providers).</p>

<p>If aged 55 to 59 years inclusive, who is a principal carer (job seeker) may choose to undertake voluntary work or a combination of voluntary work and paid work or self-employment of at least 30 hours per fortnight and the employment income, or net business income, must be at the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010100-01.html">national minimum wage</a> or above.</p>

<p>Job seekers aged 55 to 59 <strong>and who are within the first 12 months of receipt of their current income support payment</strong> (including suspension periods of up to 3 months) have a <strong>minimum requirement</strong> of 15 hours per fortnight of paid work or self-employment as part of their combination of approved voluntary work and suitable paid work.</p>

<p>After receiving their current income support payment for a 12 month period or upon turning 60 years of age, these job seekers may fully satisfy their requirements by undertaking 30 hours or more per fortnight of any combination of approved unpaid voluntary work and suitable paid work/self-employment, including solely through approved unpaid voluntary work.</p>

<p>If aged 60+, a principal carer may choose to undertake voluntary work or a combination of voluntary work and paid work or self-employment of at least 30 hours per fortnight and the employment income, or net business income, must be at the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010100-01.html">national minimum wage</a> or above.</p>

<p>Additionally, a principal carer who is under 55 years of age can have voluntary work approved by their provider, under limited circumstances. In this situation, the provider will complete all necessary checks and approvals of the voluntary work placement and the organisation - Services Australia has no role in these approvals.

A Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No RJCP Referral Required (NRRR) registration may be completed for the job seekers. They can however choose to participate on a voluntary basis with an Employment Services Provider. They will be registered as a Fully Eligible Participant (FEP)/RJCP Fully Eligible (RFE) and linked to an Employment Services Provider.</p>

<p>If their income from paid work or net business income from self-employment is less than the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010100-01.html">national minimum wage</a> amount, participation requirements will not be fully satisfied and referral to a provider will be mandatory.</p>

<p>Mature aged principal carers who are meeting their mutual obligation requirements through 30 hours per fortnight of approved voluntary work, or a combination of approved voluntary work and paid work must remain connected to their appropriate Employment Services Provider. Job seekers connected with an Employment Services Provider, the must remain registered as a FEP, however the provider may choose to suspend them for the duration of the Approved Activity. They must accept suitable offers of paid work between 15 and 25 hours a week (30 and 50 hours a fortnight). If connected with a CDP Provider, the job seeker must remain RFE.</p>

<p>Principal carer job seekers, who are engaged in self-employment, will be able to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements if they are working in the business for at least 30 hours per fortnight and their net business income is equivalent to at least 30 hours per fortnight at the <a href="../job-seekers/001-02010100-01.html">national minimum wage</a>.</p>

<p>The situation may arise where the job seeker has a viable and ongoing business; however it is operating at a loss or below the national minimum wage due to significant tax deductions. In these circumstances, the income must be assessed as not meeting the job seeker's mutual obligation requirements of 30 hours per fortnight, when calculated against the national minimum wage. The job seeker will not be considered to have satisfied their mutual obligation requirements. Principal carers who cannot fully meet their mutual obligation requirements must be referred to an Employment Services Provider who is responsible for determining appropriate activities to include in a Job Plan. This will normally be job search.</p>

<p>Any gross income and allowable deductions that relate to the business must be taken into account when assessing business income. The processes surrounding the treatment of self-employment have not changed and should not be altered for the purposes of mutual obligation requirements. See&#58;</p>
