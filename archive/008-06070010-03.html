<p>This process only applies to JCA Reports in Process Direct for referral reason DSP New Claim.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the JCA Referral was not actioned in Process Direct, the JCA Report must be accepted in Customer First. See the Customer First tab.</p>

<p>When allocated a JCA Report, staff must check&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
DSP Claim Progress <strong>DOC</strong>/<strong>Notes</strong> for information related to the claim</li>
		<li>
Check Display for Access (<strong>DOA</strong>) <strong>DOC</strong>’s for information relating to Personalised Services, and to ensure the claim is not being managed by Customer Critical Response Team (CCRT)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the claim is being managed by CCRT&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
do not accept the JCA Report or action the DSP Claim</li>
		<li>
reassign the work item to a team leader in Work Optimiser</li>
		<li>
annotate the DSP Claim Progress <strong>DOC</strong> on <strong>DL/Notes</strong> and include&#58; 'JCA Report has been allocated to Team Leader because CCRT are managing the DSP claim under HTU'</li>
		<li>
email CCRT to advise a JCA Report has been submitted for a DSP claim they are managing under HTU. Copy your line manager/team leader into the email</li>

<p>If the DSP claim is not being managed by CCRT&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a JCA report recommends manifest eligibility, in most cases the JCA report is auto-accepted by the system and attempts auto finalisation of the Disability Support Pension (DSP) claim. If the system is not able to auto-grant, a work item is allocated to a Disability Processing Service Officer for manual actioning of the new claim. See the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-05.html">Resources</a> page of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-01.html">Assessing eligibility for DSP after a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA)</a></li>

If a JCA report recommends medical eligibility, in most cases a DMA referral is auto-generated</li>

<p>See the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the report.</p>

<p>For customers with medical condition <strong>Trans Vaginal Mesh (TVM)</strong> where the JCA Report recommends medical rejection&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Do not accept the JCA Report. Update the DSP claim status to <strong>On Hold</strong> for reason <strong>Referred for JCA</strong> for 14 days</li>
		<li>
Annotate the DSP Claim Progress <strong>DOC</strong> with <strong>TVM claim has been referred to CCRT</strong></li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p>For all other medical conditions and TVM cases where the JCA supports medical eligibility, continue processing as normal.</p>

<p><strong>Check for manifest eligibility</strong></p>

<p>When an Assessor recommends a customer is manifestly eligible for Disability Support Pension (DSP), they must record the manifest indicator in the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the JCA report. This displays in the report as <strong>Customer meets manifest criteria for category</strong> followed by a specific manifest indicator code.</p>

<p>The codes and corresponding categories are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
B - Permanent Blindness (BLI)</li>
		<li>
T - Terminal Illness (TRM)</li>
		<li>
I - Intellectual Disability (INT)</li>
		<li>
N - Nursing home level of care (NHM)</li>
		<li>
H - Category 4 HIV/AIDS (HV4)</li>
		<li>
P - Disability Pension at special rate (TPI)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the Assessor correctly records the manifest indicator, it pre-fills the Medical Conditions Summary (<strong>MCSS</strong>) screen when the JCA report is accepted.</p>

<p>If the JCA referral was for a DSP new claim, the manifest indicator results in the system attempting the auto-acceptance of the JCA report and the auto-grant of the claim. If the auto-grant fails see Resources page of <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-01.html">Assessing eligibility for DSP after DMA</a>.</p>

<p>If the manifest indicator is not correctly displayed, and the JCA report is accepted by the Service Officer, the customer will be incorrectly assessed. The claim may be rejected or payment may cancel.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>must ensure</strong> the manifest indicator displays correctly <strong>before</strong> accepting a JCA report. If the Assessor has recommended manifest eligibility in the body of the report (such as in the <strong>Remarks</strong> or <strong>Assessment Summary</strong> sections) but the manifest indicator is not displayed in the JCA report, the report must be returned to Assessment Services for correction. The JCA report must not be accepted until it correctly reflects the Assessor's recommendation of manifest eligibility.</p>

<p>To return JCA Report&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
select <strong>Return</strong></li>

<p><strong>Check Temporary/Permanent, Fully Diagnosed, Treated and Stabilised (FDTS)</strong></p>

<p>Check all verified medical conditions have been recorded as detailed on the medical evidence and that the medical evidence supports the assessment of a condition as Temporary, Permanent but not FDTS, Permanent and FDTS, or manifest.</p>

<p>When an Assessor has medical evidence to support manifest eligibility for DSP they need to mark the condition as Permanent and Verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as FDTS or enter FDTS work capacities unless the customer has secondary medical conditions assessed.</p>

<p><strong>For a JCA (or an </strong><a href="../job-seekers/001-02320020-01.html">Employment Services Assessment (ESAt)<strong></a> upgraded to a JCA)</strong>, check that all medical conditions are recorded under <strong>Conditions</strong>, including&#58;</p>

		<li>
'permanent' conditions that are likely to be ongoing for at least 2 years, should be marked as permanent and verified. The Assessor needs to determine whether any permanent condition is fully diagnosed, fully treated and fully stabilised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check to identify any significant inconsistency (outside the range of possibility) between medical condition details and the work capacity details.</p>

<p>Check the assessment of the customer's ability to use public transport without substantial help is consistent with report comments about the customer's mobility. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this is only a prompt to consider inviting a claim for <a href="../people-with-disability/008-05030000-01.html">Mobility Allowance (MOB)</a> and is not a recommendation of eligibility for MOB.</p>

<p><strong>Referral recommendations</strong></p>

<p>The Assessor records recommended referrals to providers and non-providers, (for example, community mental health service) in this section of the report.</p>

<p>There are only limited circumstances in which a referral recommendation may not be stated in the report. This is generally only because the customer has future work capacity (with intervention) of less than 8 hours per week, and is unable to benefit from referral to any program.</p>

<p>Return the report if a referral recommendation is not clearly stated in this section of the report and there is no clear reason. See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-03.html#bp03_tbl_Accept_or_escal_Step01">Step 1 in Table 6</a>.</p>

<p>The customer's participation in a current program or activity, or a voluntary participation decision not to accept the offer of a referral are not valid reasons for the absence of a referral recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Immediate referrals made by the Assessor</strong></p>

<p>The Assessor's actions to make the referral must be clear in the report. This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if an immediate referral was appropriate, details of the referral, including the service provider and appointment details</li>
		<li>
whether a customer with future work capacity or temporary reduced work capacity of less than 15 hours per week declined the offer of a referral</li>
		<li>
if the Assessor intended the referral to be deferred because of the customer's temporary reduced work capacity - supported by other information in the report</li>

<p>Check the <strong>MC</strong> screen to confirm if the correct JCA event date is showing. Check the Pension Assessment (<strong>PNA</strong>) screen, to make sure the correct start date is coded. If required, manually amend the Date of Event on <strong>MC</strong>, so the JCA date is the same as the <strong>PNA</strong> screen date. See also, <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03070030-01.html">Youth Disability Supplement (YDS) assessments</a>. This date can affect the customer’s YDS, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-08060000-01.html">Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA)</a>, and <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06050000-01.html">Pensioner Concession Card (PCC)</a> entitlement.</p>

<p>Once a JCA report has been accepted by the agency, it will be auto-attached to the customer's eMIFE. The <strong>MC</strong> screen and the Work Capacity (<strong>WC</strong>) screen display with information updated from the report.</p>

<p><strong>Partial Capacity to Work</strong></p>

<p>If the report recommends Partial Capacity to Work (PCW) for Youth Allowance (YAL) customers under 22 years, Process Direct will update the Independence/Homeless/Away for Home Details (<strong>NIH</strong>) screen to code <a href="../job-seekers/001-04030050-01.html">independence</a> to allow acceptance of the report. </p>

<p><strong>JCA Report cannot be accepted in Process Direct</strong></p>

<p>If the JCA report does not accept, this is indicative that further assessment of customer circumstances is required.</p>
		<ul>		<li>

			<ul>			<li>
investigate the customer’s record further to determine eligibility and start date for Independence PCW, and</li>
			<li>
manually code the <strong>NIH</strong> screen as part of JCA acceptance</li>

accept the JCA report in Customer First. See <a href="../job-seekers/001-04030050-01.html">Assessing independence for customers with a partial capacity to work</a></li>		</ul>

complete updates to ACS as part of the same activity. See <a href="../debts/107-02020030-01.html">Actioning negative adjustments on the Assessment Results screen</a>. </li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if the JCA Acceptance has been attempted in PD, the accept button may not be accessible in Customer First, if this occurs&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
select the NSS/JCA activity from Activity List (<strong>AL</strong>) in Customer First, before selecting <strong>Continue</strong>, enter <strong>MCSS</strong> in the Next field, then select <strong>Continue</strong></li>
		<li>
check the JCA outcome is present on <strong>MC</strong>, and the correct Event Date is coded (same as the DSP Claim PNA date) and amend (if required) </li>
		<li>
go to Assessment Results (<strong>AR</strong>) screen to finalise the JCA acceptance</li>
		<li>
if the JCA outcome is not present on MC, refer to Level 2 Policy Helpdesk via the Online Enquiry form</li>
		</ul>
<p>The JCA report status remains submitted for 28 days. It then becomes finalised from day 29. If required, staff with relevant access can request early finalisation of the JCA report. This stops delays to DSP new claims if a new referral needs to be made immediately after the previous report is submitted. Once the report is selected for finalisation, it will be finalised overnight.</p>

<p>When the JCA report is accepted, it auto-generates a <strong>DOC</strong> which includes details when&#58;</p>

<p>For customers with medical condition <strong>Trans Vaginal Mesh (TVM)</strong> where the JCA Report recommends medical rejection&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Do not accept the JCA Report</li>
		<li>
Run the Streaming and Progress <strong>DOC</strong> script to hold the claim for reason JCA for 14 days</li>

Update DSP Claim Progress <strong>DOC</strong> with '<strong>TVM claim has been referred to CCRT</strong>'</li>
		<li>

		</ul>
<p>For all other medical conditions and TVM cases where the JCA supports medical eligibility, continue processing as normal.</p>

<p><strong>Check for manifest eligibility</strong></p>

<p>When an Assessor recommends a recipient is manifestly eligible for Disability Support Pension (DSP), they must record the manifest indicator in the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) report. This displays in the report as <strong>Recipient meets manifest criteria for category</strong> followed by a specific manifest indicator code.</p>

<p>The codes and corresponding categories are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
B - Permanent Blindness (BLI)</li>
		<li>
T - Terminal Illness (TRM)</li>
		<li>
I - Intellectual Disability (INT)</li>
		<li>
N - Nursing home level of care (NHM)</li>
		<li>
H - Category 4 HIV/AIDS (HV4)</li>
		<li>
P - Disability Pension at special rate (TPI)</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the Assessor correctly records the manifest indicator, it populates the Medical Conditions Summary Screen (<strong>MCSS</strong>) when the JCA report is accepted.</p>

<p>If the JCA referral was for a DSP new claim, in most cases the manifest indicator also triggers the auto-acceptance of the JCA report and the auto-grant of the claim. If the auto-grant fails, see the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030130-01.html">Assessing eligibility for DSP after DMA</a> Resources page for action required.</p>

<p>If the manifest indicator is not correctly displayed, and the JCA report is accepted by the Service Officer, the recipient will be incorrectly assessed. The claim may be rejected or payment may cancel.</p>

<p>Service Officers <strong>must make sure</strong> the manifest indicator is displaying correctly <strong>before </strong>accepting a JCA report. Where the Assessor has recommended manifest eligibility in the body of the report (such as in the <strong>Remarks</strong> or <strong>Assessment Summary</strong> sections) but the manifest indicator is not displayed in the JCA report, return the report to Assessment Services for correction. The JCA report <strong>must not</strong> be accepted until it correctly reflects the Assessor's recommendation of manifest eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when returning the report, Service Officers must include 'No Manifest Indicator coded in JCA Report' in the Return free text field. For further details refer to <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Accept_or_escal01">Table 6</a>.</p>

<p>If Service Officers identify a claim rejection or payment cancellation has occurred because the manifest indicator has not been correctly coded and applied in the JCA report, the case <strong>must be urgently escalated to</strong> the DIS Service Delivery Support Team for investigation and resolution. The email must be titled&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Check Temporary/Permanent, Fully Diagnosed, Treated and Stabilised (FDTS)</strong></p>

<p>Check all verified medical conditions have been recorded as detailed on the medical evidence and the assessment of a condition as Temporary, Permanent but not FDTS, Permanent and FDTS, or manifest is supported by the medical evidence.</p>

<p>When an Assessor has medical evidence to support manifest eligibility for DSP they need to mark the condition as Permanent and Verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as FDTS nor enter FDTS work capacities unless the recipient has secondary medical conditions assessed.</p>

<p><strong>For a JCA (or an ESAt upgraded to a JCA)</strong>, check that all medical conditions are recorded under the <strong>Conditions</strong> including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
all verified conditions (regardless of whether or not they have a functional impact) and recorded as either 'temporary' or 'permanent'</li>
		<li>
all unverified, self-reported or assessor observed conditions; recorded as 'other'</li>
		<li>
permanent conditions that are likely to be ongoing for at least 2 years, should be marked as permanent and verified. The Assessor needs to determine whether any permanent condition is fully diagnosed, fully treated and fully stabilised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check to identify any significant inconsistency (outside the range of possibility) between medical condition details and the work capacity details.</p>

<p>Check the assessment of the recipient's ability to use public transport without substantial assistance is consistent with report comments about the recipient's mobility.</p>

<p>When an Assessor has medical evidence to support manifest eligibility for DSP they need to mark the condition as persist for more than 2 years and Verified by medical evidence. It is not mandatory to mark the condition as DTS nor enter DTS work capacities unless the recipient has secondary medical conditions assessed.</p>

all verified conditions (regardless of whether or not they have a functional impact) and recorded as either 'persist for less than 2 years’ or 'persist for more than 2 years’</li>
		<li>
all unverified, self-reported or assessor observed conditions, recorded as 'other'</li>
		<li>
The Assessor needs to determine whether any conditions that persist for more than 2 years, are diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised</li>
		</ul>
<p>Check to identify any significant inconsistency (outside the range of possibility) between medical condition details and the work capacity details.</p>

<p>Check the assessment of the recipient's ability to use public transport without substantial assistance is consistent with report comments about the recipient's mobility.</p>

<p><strong>Referral recommendations</strong></p>

<p>The Assessor records recommended referrals to providers and non-providers (for example, community mental health service) in this section of the report.</p>

<p>There are only limited circumstances in which a referral recommendation may not be stated in the report. This is generally only because the recipient has future work capacity (with intervention) of less than 8 hours per week, and is unable to benefit from referral to any program.</p>

<p>Return the report if a referral recommendation is not clearly stated in this section of the report and there is no valid reason, see <a href="../people-with-disability/008-06070010-03.html#bp03_L3TT_Accept_or_escal01">Table 6</a>.</p>

<p>The recipient's participation in a current program or activity, or a voluntary participation decision not to accept the offer of a referral are not valid reasons for the absence of a referral recommendation.</p>

<p>The Assessor's actions to make the referral must be clearly evident in the report itself. This includes&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
if an immediate referral was appropriate, details of the referral, including the service provider and appointment details</li>
		<li>
whether a recipient with future work capacity or temporary reduced work capacity of less than 15 hours per week declined the offer of a referral</li>
		<li>
if the Assessor intended the referral to be deferred because of the recipient's temporary reduced work capacity - supported by other information in the report</li>
