	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When finalising a complaint select a source of issue in Cuba. This should reflect the business area, product, policy, individual or service that lead to the complaint reasons. Often there are multiple sources â€“ select the 1 that most contributed to the complaint. This is not an indication of whether a complaint is upheld or not, it just reflects the triggers for normal complaints. This helps Services Australia understand our customerâ€™s feedback.</p>

<p>The accurate identification of <strong>source of issue</strong> when finalising complaints, allows the agency to understand what leads to customer complaints. Source of issue needs to include Cuba details including Region / Office / Stream â€“ Team and Position. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> the source should only be allocated to an individual staff position when you have confirmation from both the customer and through your review that this is main contributor to the complaint. If the complaint source was not an individual service officer, choose a Cuba position that is not an individual, that is a â€˜noneâ€™ pool or allocation position in a team. </p>

<p>If the source of issue is unclear, take the following steps to identify the source&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
check the customer transfer history</li>
		<li>
check RAS for any actions or notes on intrays</li>
		<li>
if it is about a staff member but that has moved business lines, contact the Service Officer's current Team Leader to discuss where the staff member was located when the reason for the complaint occurred</li>
		<li>
check notepads for signature blocks and user identification numbers</li>
		<li>
use Microsoft Teams or Outlook to determine which team or business line someone works in and their manager's details</li>
