tasks they, or any applying partner, need to complete before submitting their claim</li>

<p>Tasks may be <strong>supplementary</strong> or <strong>required</strong>. The claim cannot be submitted until all required tasks are completed.</p>

<p>If a task requires the customer or Nominee to provide a document, there is an <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-03.html">Upload documents</a> button next to the applicable task. Customer or Nominee can use this to <a href="../self-service/133-04060000-03.html">upload documents</a> directly into the online claim.</p>

<p>Encourage the customer or Nominee to access their Centrelink online account via myGov to upload documents and submit their claim. This is the quickest and easiest way for customers to complete their tasks and allow claim submission.</p>

<p>If needed, help the customer or Nominee to upload the documents and submit their claim online. Once the customer or Nominee has selected a document to upload, they submit it as follows&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Press <strong>Ready to Submit</strong></li>
		<li>
Complete a <strong>Declaration</strong> about the document(s) by ticking the box, and</li>

<p>Once the uploaded document(s) have been submitted the associated tasks will display a status of <strong>Done</strong>.</p>

If a task requires a customer or Nominee to attend a Service centre to provide documents, Service Officers should&#58; Scan the documents</li>
		<li>
Code identity documents in the <strong>Identity Confirmation Dashboard</strong> in <strong>Process Direct</strong>. If the Identity Confirmation Status is updated to <strong>Confirmed</strong>, complete the associated identity task</li>
		<li>
For all other documents, run the <strong>Request &amp; Manage Customer Tasks</strong> guided procedure to complete the associated task</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer or Nominee uploaded or provided documents before starting the online claim, a task may still display on the <strong>Next Steps</strong> page for the document to be provided. The customer or Nominee can either&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
upload the document again on the <strong>Next Steps</strong> page, or</li>
		<li>
contact Services Australia to have the <strong>Request &amp; Manage Customer Tasks</strong> guided procedure run to complete the task. Before completing the task for the customer’s claim, Service Officers must check that the document has been provided</li>
		</ul>
<p></p>

<p>If a customer or nominee contacts and requests a consent form, print and send for completion. </p>

<p>Once all required tasks display a status of <strong>Done</strong>, the <strong>Submit</strong> button will show and the customer or Nominee if it is a combined claim, the partner can submit the claim. To be assessed from the earliest possible date, HEAS customers (including Nominees) should provide all the requested information and submit the claim as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Once submitted, a message displays to the customer or Nominee to confirm their claim for the HEAS has been successfully submitted and the following information displays&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>

<p>The purpose of Part A to Part F of the HEAS application form (SA310 partnered or SA496 single) is to get signed authorities and declarations for the loan from the applicant and any other party who has a registered interest in the real estate offered as security for the loan. This may include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer’s partner, if they are a member of a couple</li>
		<li>
co-owners of the property</li>
		<li>
individual or corporate trustees where the real estate is the asset of a trust</li>
		<li>
company directors or secretaries for real estate owned by a company</li>
		</ul>
<p>An applicant may be required to provide one or more parts with their application. Some applicants may not be required to provide any parts at all, for example single customers who apply online and offer real estate that they have 100% ownership of.</p>

<p>Parts A-F may be required regardless of which lodgement channel an applicant uses. Whether they apply using an online claim, ACC or the SA310/SA496, the applicant will be advised at the <strong>Next Steps</strong> section which parts, if any, they are required to provide.</p>

<p>Where an applicant is required to provide Part A – Part F, they should keep a copy of the signed pages for their own records.</p>

<p>It is the applicant’s responsibility to arrange and get the signed declarations and authorities to provide with their application. Services Australia do not issue written requests to third parties to seek their consent to the HEAS loan, however upon receiving all supporting documentation may make verbal contact with the impacted parties before granting the HEAS loan to ensure they understand the HEAS and possible impacts for the property. </p>

<p><strong>Part A</strong> of the SA310/SA496 is used to get the applicant and (if any) their partner’s signed declaration and acknowledgements for the HEAS loan, and authority to inspect the real estate property offered as security for the loan.</p>

<p><strong>All applicants</strong> must complete Part A <strong>except</strong> single customers, or their Nominee, who apply online (including ACC, unless a verbal declaration is completed in which case the customer needs to provide Part A).</p>

<p>For customers who are members of a couple (MoC), their partner <strong>must</strong> also read and sign Part A, even if they are not applying for a loan themselves. </p>

<p>It is a legislative requirement per Section 1136(1B)(2) of the Social Security Act 1991 that both MoC sign the request for either member to participate in the HEAS. </p>

<p>It is for this reason that <strong>all partnered applicants</strong>, even those who apply online or via ACC, <strong>must complete the SA310 Part A </strong>to verify their signed joint consent to the loan application.</p>
