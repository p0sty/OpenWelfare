<p>David claims Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) at the unreasonable to live at home (UTLAH) rate within 4 weeks of leaving home. David is a 17 year old job seeker, living in safe and secure accommodation with an aunt, but has minimal funds. While waiting for the YA/UTLAH claim to be finalised, David's aunt is meeting some of David’s immediate needs. David needs to pay her back. David is granted YA/UTLAH.</p>

<p>David indicates there is only $20 in their bank account. As this is less than 2 weeks' allowance at the maximum payment rate payable to David, they would be considered to be in severe financial hardship.</p>

<p>David will qualify for a waiver of the OWP as the personal financial crisis occurred within the 4 weeks prior to the start date of payment, and provides the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Evidence of current liquid assets. This could be a bank statement or a digital copy of account information showing transactions over the relevant period (date ceased work or previous circumstance to date of claim), it must include&#58;</li>

BSB and account number</li>

		<li>
Information on David's record regarding the UTLAH claim is also to be considered supporting evidence of these circumstances</li>

<p>Nina claims JobSeeker Payment (JSP) after losing a casual waitressing job. Nina is in hardship, and when the Service Officer assessing Nina's claim discusses the criteria for personal financial crisis, Nina advises of an abusive relationship until about 3 weeks ago, when the ex-partner moved out.</p>

<p>Nina has no supporting evidence such as a domestic and family violence order, police report, doctor's report, or letter from a support service. Nina saw a social worker at the local health centre to seek support prior to the ex-partner moving out.</p>

<p>If Nina can provide the following evidence, the OWP will be waived&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
proof of current liquid assets. This could be a bank statement or a digital copy of an account showing transactions over the relevant period (date ceased work or previous circumstance until date of claim). It must include&#58;</li>

<p>Dan is 21, claims Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) who is eligible for the living away from home rate of payment. Dan had $750 and became unemployed 2 weeks ago. Dan lives in rental accommodation and pays $150 per week rent, and has liquid assets of $350 at the time of Dan's claim. Dan claims hardship and as evidence provides a bank statement covering the relevant period (date ceased work or previous circumstance until date of claim) and a $20 supermarket receipt for groceries.</p>

<p>If some or all of the following evidence can be provided, Dan will qualify for a waiver of the OWP as Dan is experiencing a personal financial crisis (including being in severe financial hardship) and his available funds are less than 2 weeks at the maximum rate of payment&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a rent receipt covering a period of time within the 4 weeks prior to the payment start date, plus any utility bills paid within the 4 weeks, or</li>

<p>Rory is aged 20 and claiming Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) after losing a casual job. Rory advised of $1,200 in their bank account and no cash 4 weeks ago, however they advised that they now have $200 in their bank account and $50 on hand for day-to-day expenses. Rory advised of no other liquid assets. Rory lives in rental accommodation with two friends and pays $200 per month for rent.</p>

<p>When asked about expenses over the last four weeks, Rory advised expenses including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
$200 rent</li>
		<li>
a  new phone for $600 as an upgrade</li>
		<li>
a special gift and dinner for their mum's 50th birthday last week, which cost $150.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Rory provides evidence of paying the rent and the purchase of the new phone.</p>

<p>A gift and dinner for Rory's mother is not considered an unavoidable expenditure.</p>

<p>Purchasing a new phone is generally not considered an unavoidable or reasonable expenditure. The purchase amount would be disregarded in calculating severe financial hardship unless Rory can provide evidence that the old phone no longer worked and this was the main form of contact for prospective employers.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If Rory provides evidence to support that the new phone was essential, it could be considered as unavoidable or reasonable expenditure and the OWP waived as Rory's available funds would be under the allowable limit</li>
		<li>
If no suitable evidence for the purchase of the phone was provided, the OWP should not be waived, as the assessed available funds would be over the allowable limit. For example, Rory had $1,000 4 weeks ago minus unavoidable expenditure of $200 equals $1,000 assessed as available funds. This is more than 2 weeks benefit Rory would be entitled to, therefore Rory would not be considered in severe financial hardship</li>		</ul>

Jenna also has $90 in cash and confirms there is no other liquid assets. Jenna's Employment Separation Certificate confirms no leave payments are due.</p>

<p>Jenna lives in a rental property costing $200 a week, and provides bank statements to verify rent payment. Jenna also provides a receipt for car registration of $700 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Jenna has provided suitable evidence that the reasonable cost of living and an unavoidable financial expense have placed Jenna in severe financial hardship. Jenna now only has $240 in available funds. Because Jenna's funds are less than 2 weeks at the maximum rate of payment, Jenna is eligible to have the OWP waived.</p>

<p>Rosanne produces receipts for groceries purchased during the 4 weeks prior to Roseanne's start date totalling $190. Roseanne also provides evidence for utility bills paid during this period that totals $200.</p>

<p>Rosanne and Greg have demonstrated they are in severe financial hardship and have provided evidence of the expenses they have incurred in line with the reasonable cost of living.
