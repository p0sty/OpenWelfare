<div class="showcont">


<p>Only use this procedure when assessing residence information for FTB, PPL and DAP claims.</p>

<p>For current FTB customers, it may be necessary to update&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020010-01.html">country of residence</a></li>
		<li>
<a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020050-01.html">visa information for legal residence status</a></li>
		<li>
<a target="_blank" href="../initial-contact-general/106-06020060-01.html">Australian citizenship details</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>To grant an <strong>FTB</strong> claim, the claimant must satisfy the residence requirements at the date of claim. The partner does not have to meet the residence requirements for FTB to be paid. However, under social security law, the partner must meet the residence requirements (and provide proof) for Health Care Card (HCC) purposes, which includes being noted as a partner on the customer's FTB maximum rate HCC.</p>

<p>If the claimant is subject to the Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Period (NARWP) for FTB Part A or is otherwise not qualified and has a partner, the partner’s circumstances should be investigated. If the partner is not subject to the NARWP for FTB Part A, for example the claimant’s partner may be an Australian citizen or the holder of a visa that exempts them from the NARWP for FTB Part A, attempts should be made to contact the claimant to advise them that FTB Part A may be payable if their partner claims FTB.</p>

<p>For a <strong>DAP</strong> claim to be granted, claimants must satisfy the residence requirements for each day in their DAP period (of up to 14 days).</p>

<p>To grant <strong>PPL</strong> the claimant must satisfy the residence requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
For children born or adopted <strong>on or after 1 July 2023</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Residence requirements remain unchanged</li>
			<li>
All claimants must meet the residence requirements on the date of birth or date of entry into care and on each of their PPL days in order to be eligible</li>
			<li>
For an initial eligibility determination, all claimants must meet the residence requirements on the date of determination. This is consistent with the current requirement for primary claimants</li>
			<li>
As the PPL period is being removed, there will be no requirement for claimants to meet the residence requirements between PPL days</li>		</ul>
		<li>
For children born or adopted <strong>before 1 July 2023</strong>&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
To be eligible for the PPL period, primary claimants must satisfy the residence requirements from the date of birth or adoption of the child until the end of their PPL period. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> primary PPL claimants must complete the NARWP <strong>before</strong> their child's birth or entry to care to meet residency requirements. Payment cannot be transferred to a secondary claimant if a primary claimant is still serving their NARWP on or after their child's date of birth or entry to care</li>
			<li>
To be eligible for the PPL period, secondary or tertiary claimants must satisfy the residence requirements from the date they became the primary carer of the child until the end of their PPL period</li>
			<li>
Flexible PPL days can be paid up to 30 dates nominated by the customer. To be paid Flexible PPL the customer must meet residence requirements on their nominated Flexible PPL date</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>Father and partner payability is no longer dependent on the birth mother meeting the residence requirements.</p>

<p>If the PPL claimant ceases to meet the residence requirements at any point after the grant of their claim, for example their qualifying visa is cancelled, their entitlement to PPL ceases from last day residentially qualified plus 1 day. See <a href="../families/007-02080030-01.html">Changing Australian residence details for family assistance and Paid Parental Leave scheme customer/child</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)</strong> has the same residence requirements as FTB. To be eligible for SBP, a claimant must meet the FTB residence requirements within 26 weeks of the day of the child's delivery, or qualify for FTB for another child within 52 weeks of the stillbirth. However, they do not have to serve the NARWP.</p>

<p>To ensure all available residence information is available from the Immigration Datalink for FTB, PPL and DAP claims, it is important to check the Immigration Advised Movements (<strong>RSIM</strong>) screen in and check the <strong>ILD</strong> field.</p>

<p>Is the <strong>ILD</strong> field is set to the earliest date of arrival into Australia?</p>

<p>If FTB, PPL or DAP was granted as the customer indicated they would be living in Australia, but upon review it is found they have not made sufficient efforts to 'put down roots' in Australia as they had implied, their entitlement to payment from date of grant may be reviewed.</p>

<p>If there is subsequently sufficient evidence to support the fact the customer never intended to reside in Australia, there may be a debt raised owing to the Commonwealth from the date of grant.</p>

<p>To serve the NARWP the customer must be physically present in Australia for the relevant period (52 weeks for FTB Part A and 104 weeks for PPL/DAP), as an Australian resident, special category visa holder or as the holder of a specified visa subclass.</p>

<p><strong>FTB</strong></p>

<p>If the FTB customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
will be assessed as ineligible for FTB Part A and B and has a partner who may not be subject to the NARWP for FTB Part A, contact with the customer is not required as the claim will be rejected and a letter issued. The partner can lodge a claim for FTB. Continue to assess the claim</li>
		<li>
is not partnered, continue to assess the claim</li>
		<li>
will be assessed to receive FTB Part B and partner is not subject to the NARWP, <a href="../families/007-05020020-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessing_if_th_Step15">go to  Step 15</a></li>

<p><strong>PPL/DAP</strong></p>

<p>For children born or adopted <strong>on or after 1 July 2023</strong>, father and partner payability is no longer dependent on the birth mother having served, or being exempt from the NARWP.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the PPL period PPL claimants must complete the NARWP <strong>before</strong> their child's birth or entry to care to meet residence requirements.</p>

<p>To be eligible for a PPL day, the customer must satisfy the residence requirements on the date of birth or adoption of the child <strong>and</strong> they must also have completed the NARWP the day before their nominated PPL day.</p>

<p>For children born or adopted <strong>before 1 July 2023</strong>, payment cannot be transferred to a secondary claimant if a primary claimant is still serving their NARWP on or after their child's date of birth or entry into care.</p>

<p>For claimants who are Australian residents, the end date of the NARWP is calculated and held on&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the FTB NARWP Explanation (<strong>FTBNEX</strong>) screen in Customer First for FTB, or</li>
		<li>
the PPL/DAP Waiting Periods Calculations (<strong>P1PAP</strong>) for PPL or DAP, in Customer First, accessed via the PPL Claim Summary (<strong>P1CS</strong>) screen</li>
		</ul>
<p>Use this when advising the customer of future entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>FTB/PPL/DAP</strong></p>

<p>If the system calculates the NARWP has not yet been served, and the customer was an Australian resident before 1 September 1994, record past periods of residence on the Country of Residence (<strong>CRES</strong>) screen.</p>

<p>If the claim is incorrectly granting when the customer has not served or is not exempt from the NARWP, check the Family Member/Refugee Code on the Residence Savings (<strong>RSS</strong>) screen. If FMC, FME or PRE is coded, <a target="_blank" href="../migrants-refugees-and-visitors/005-02020020-03.html">refer case to CIS for exemption coding</a> to be ended.</p>

<p>If claim is PPL or DAP only, finalise the claim. See <a href="../families/007-17100603-01.html">Processing standalone and combined claims for family assistance and/or Paid Parental Leave scheme payments.</a></p>

<p>If the customer’s partner is not subject to the NARWP, for example, the customer’s partner may be an Australian citizen or the holder of a visa that exempts them from the NARWP for FTB Part A, make a genuine attempt to contact the customer to discuss that FTB Part A may be payable if the partner claims FTB.</p>

<p>Prior to calling, Desktop Electronic Messaging Capability (DEMC) may be used to advise the customer they will be receiving a phone call. See <a href="../self-service/133-05000000-01.html">Centrelink letters online and Electronic Messaging</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer is not contactable, issue a Q164 - Request to contact letter. Manually place the claim on hold. Claim activities must be held for a minimum of 22 days to allow extra time for mail delivery and for customers to respond.</p>

<p>Record details in the Progress of claim DOC. Details <strong>must</strong> include&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
what information must be asked of the customer when they make contact</li>
		<li>
details of what information the Service Officer receiving the call must document to enable the claim to progress, i.e., does the customer want to withdraw their claim and been advised the partner needs to lodge a claim for FTB </li>
