<p><strong>If customer has nominee arrangement in place?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a <strong>nominee arrangement</strong> is in place, the customer has the right to interact with Services Australia about their payment, however the existence of a nominee arrangement is an indicator that care <strong>must</strong> be taken when assessing the customer's request. Contacting the nominee before making a decision about the request is considered appropriate to make sure that all care and consideration is given to the welfare of the customer</li>
		<li>
A <strong>correspondence nominee</strong> may request a Replacement Payment on the customer's behalf but the payment <strong>must</strong> be made to the customer</li>
		<li>
A <strong>payment nominee</strong> cannot request a Replacement Payment on the customer's behalf. This request <strong>must</strong> be made by the customer</li>
		<li>
If approved, a Replacement Payment <strong>must</strong> be issued to the same person the regular payment is made to. Therefore, if a payment nominee exists, the Replacement Payment must be made to the nominee unless the nominee agrees for payment to be made to the customer or a third party<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a nominee is not entitled to be issued or collect an EBT card; however, an EBT can be issued to the customer if the nominee consents to this arrangement</li>
		<li>
If a <strong>guardianship order</strong> is in place with the <strong>Protective Office/ Guardianship Authority</strong> (or other state based authority, for example, Public Trustee), the customer is legally unable to handle his or her own affairs. For this reason, the guardianship authority should be contacted about the request for a Replacement Payment. The existence of this type of nominee arrangement will display on the Nominee Relationship Summary (<strong>NORS</strong>) screen on the nominee's record as INV - involuntary (CRT or PAI)</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> a third party who is not a nominee or a person with permission to enquire (PPE) only cannot apply for a Replacement Payment on the customer's behalf.</p>

<p><strong>If customer is Under 18 dependent YA or ABSTUDY?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Dependent Youth Allowance (YA) or ABSTUDY customers under 18 years of age, who have their regular payments directed to their parents, may qualify for a replacement payment, but the payment <strong>must</strong> be made to the parent unless the parent directs otherwise</li>
		<li>
A parent cannot request a replacement payment on behalf of their dependent child, unless the parent is the customer's <strong>correspondence nominee</strong>. A parent is not entitled to be issued or collect an EBT card</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>If customer is paid via a Group payment schedule?</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
Group schedule arrangements occur when the customer lives in residential care, or when a public trustee is managing the customer's affairs. Contacting the organisation's administrator before making a decision about the request is considered appropriate to make sure that all care and consideration is given to the welfare of the customer. If the customer is paid to the public trustee, payments cannot be redirected to the customer without prior approval of the trust officer</li>
		<li>
The payment <strong>must</strong> be made via the organisation unless the organisation's administrator directs otherwise</li>
		<li>
The replacement payment issued via the schedule can only be issued to the institution nominated on Entitlement Period End Day (EPED) B, a payment issued on any other EPED will fail to deliver. See <a href="../payment-delivery/103-04010130-01.html">Group payment schedules and payments to organisations</a>. If the payment is required by the organisation sooner the payment maybe issued as a manual cheque</li>

<p><strong>What is Legal Access?</strong></p>

<p>A customer has legal access to a bank account when they are a signatory to the account, that is, the account is in the customer's name whether singularly or jointly with someone else and the customer is legally <strong>able to withdraw funds</strong> (regardless of if the account is open or closed). Legal access does not include situations where the customer has access to someone else's account because they have been given the access card and PIN number.</p>

<p><strong>Does a payment have to be returned before it can be reissued to the customer?</strong></p>

<p>The original payment does not need to be returned before it is reissued <strong>if it has been verified the customer does not have legal access to the account or the customer will not be placed in severe financial hardship due to the delay</strong>. The customer must be advised they will have a debt if they receive the original payment and it is not returned to the agency by the financial institution.</p>

<p>If the payment destination details were correct, but the payment has not been received, the customer is to be referred to the financial institution to have the matter resolved.</p>

<p>NPP payments are delivered in real time only if both the customer’s Bank/State/Branch (BSB) number and nominated account has been NPP-enabled.</p>

<p>There should be no delay in a customer receiving an NPP payment. If the funds have not been credited to the customer's account and the customer confirms the account details are correct, the NPP may be unavailable.

<p>Customers are to be advised that the RTGS payment will be delivered by close of business on the day the payment was processed (9 am the next day for some credit unions). Some financial institutions may make the funds available sooner.</p>

<p>If the funds have not been credited to the customer's account, contact the financial institution to determine when the funds will be made available in the account the payment has been made to.</p>

<p>An RTGS payment (that has not been returned) requires approval from the ICT Service Desk <strong>before being replaced</strong>. Doing so without prior approval may result in the customer being paid twice for the same period.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting delay</strong></p>

<p>The delay in the payment being received or a fee being charged must be reported using mySupport - select the mySupport webform according to the payment type the customer is receiving (for example, if payment type is JobSeeker Payment select the 'JobSeeker Payment (JSP)' webform).</p>

		<ul>		<li>
If an RTGS outage has occurred a description of the problem, environments or financial institutions affected and the estimated time it will be fixed (if known) will be published as a Newsflash</li>
		<li>
Payments processed between 8 am and 9 am will be bundled together and sent to the RBA at 9 am (Sydney/Canberra/Melbourne time)</li>
		<li>
Some financial institutions and some types of savings account use a manual process to clear and credit the customer's account. This manual process may result in payments only being processed three times a day or processed at the institutions close of business on the day the payment was issued</li>
		<li>
If the RTGS payment has been selected for QOLing, it is vital that it is checked and finalised immediately as a delay may result in it not making the cut-off time (3&#58;30 pm Sydney/Canberra/Melbourne time). If this occurs the payment will be sent to the RBA at 9 am the next morning</li>
		<li>
Local public holidays where the financial institution processing centre is located may result in the payment not being processed on the same day<br><strong>Note&#58;</strong> this would only affect small institutions, as large institutions are able to move the work to another location to clear and credit the customer's account.

<p><strong>What financial institution was the payment made to?</strong></p>

<p>The NPP payment option will be presented, if the customer’s Bank/State/Branch (BSB) number has been NPP reachable. However, in order for the payment to be successful, the customer’s nominated account must also be able to use the NPP.</p>

<p>If payment cannot be made via the NPP due to the customer’s nominated account not being enabled to use the NPP, or the service itself is unavailable, an error message will display. Tell the customer to speak with their financial institution about the NPP for more information.</p>

<p>Unlike RTGS payments, crediting of the saving account will not be delayed if it is attached to a Visa or MasterCard, or debit card as NPP payments are made in real time.</p>

<p><strong>Was the account overdrawn when the NPP payment was made to it?</strong></p>

<p>When an account is overdrawn (even if it is only by a few cents), it no longer behaves like a savings account and requires manual intervention by the financial institution's staff for the funds to be credited to the account. The customer must attend the branch and arrange to have the debt finalised.</p>

<p><strong>What financial institution was the payment made to?</strong></p>

<p>Some financial institutions and some types of savings account use a manual process to clear and credit the customer's account. This manual process may result in payments only being processed three times a day or all processed at the institutions close of business on the day the payment was processed.</p>

<p>For this reason, customers are to be advised the payment will be delivered by close of business on the day the payment was processed (next day for some credit unions and building societies), if the payment is processed by 3.30 pm (NSW and VIC time). Some financial institutions may make the funds available sooner.</p>
