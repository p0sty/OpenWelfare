<p>This document explains how Single Touch Payroll (STP) data is used by Services Australia. It explains how employment details and income components are received, displayed and calculated. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<div class="twisty">
	
<a class="anchor" name="bp01_L2GT_What_is_Single_"></a>
<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_What_is_Single_">What is Single Touch Payroll</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Government initiative where employers report payroll information via STP enabled software to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) each time employees are paid. This STP reported payroll information is known as a pay event. It can occur&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
weekly</li>
		<li>
fortnightly</li>
		<li>
 monthly</li>
		<li>
other frequencies</li>
		</ul>
<p>Reporting of pay events by employers using PayEvent 2020 data became mandatory from 1 January 2022 but there has been an ongoing transition period. This means customers may have all, some or none of their employment details reported via STP. During this transition period, customers may have all, some or none of their employment details pre-filled. Reporting via STP will gradually increase over time.</p>

<p>Where available, STP data will pre-fill in customer and staff-facing reporting tool. Services Australia accesses and prepares the required data in near real time.</p>

<p>Customers are still responsible for checking their income details when there is pre-filled STP data. Customers must review the pre-filled data and make changes (adjust and/or add details), if needed. When the customer is satisfied with the employment details, they must confirm the data. The confirmed STP data then shows in the reporting task. The customer can&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
manually add any other employment details for themselves and their partner, and</li>
		<li>
add hours worked, if needed</li>
		</ul>
<p>The STP service simplifies the reporting of employment details, but does not replace a customer's obligation to report all their circumstances accurately. </p>

<p>Customers cannot opt out of pre-filling of STP data.</p>

<p>The safety of customers’ information is Services Australia's first priority.</p>

<p>Services Australia will always tell customers what it is collecting, why and who it will be shared with. The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) regulates how government agencies and some other organisations handle personal information.</p>

<p>Services Australia will only get the information needed, and customers can update their information if it’s incorrect.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When an STP employer reports employment income data for an employee who is on an income support payment (ISP), service profiling will place them on 2 weekly <a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-04180000-03.html#bp03_tbl_Reporting_onlin_2">statement reporting</a>.</p>

<p>Service profiling can also take some customers off reporting. Customers with no mutual obligation requirements and with no other employment income, will be taken off reporting or reverted back to their prior reporting requirements&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
6 fortnights after confirming their STP cessation details including the cessation date, or</li>
		<li>
if there are no STP cessation details, after having no STP pay events for 6 consecutive fortnights</li>
		</ul>
<p>If customers are automatically taken off reporting for the above reasons, or manually by a Service Officer and a later STP pay event is available, the customer will be placed back on 2 weekly statement reporting. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-03.html#bp03_tbl_Common_question_13">Process</a> for more details.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>When customers report through self service channels and STP data is available, details will show in the STP confirmation service. This means the reporting task will be a 2 step process.</p>

<p>The customer must review the pre-filled information, make any required changes and then confirm the STP Declaration by selecting <strong>Submit and continue</strong>. The customer will then enter the Report employment income (REI) service to complete their reporting task. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-03.html#bp03_tbl_Processing_STP_3">Process</a> for more details.</p>

<p>If there is no STP data available at the time of reporting, the customer will enter directly into the Report employment income (REI) service and can add any employment income details, including partner income (if applicable), and hours worked, if needed.</p>

ABN/WPN</li>
		</ul>
<p>The customer must review and either confirm or reject that they are working for the STP employer.</p>

<p>Where the customer confirms they are working for the employer, the STP details can be linked with an existing employer from their record or have a new employer entry created. If the customer claims to not work for the employer, the customer can reject it.

<p>When a customer confirms an STP employer, STP pay events paid in the customer’s entitlement period may pre-fill for the customer to check and confirm or change.</p>

<p>There may be cases where the pre-filled STP data does not match the gross amount that was paid in a customer’s reporting period. Pay event data may include more than one type of <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-05.html#bp05_L3TT_STP_employment_">income component</a>.

		<div class="block">

<p>When a customer needs to report earlier than their usual reporting day due to a public holiday or overseas departure, any available STP data will pre-fill. If the employer has not yet run their payroll, the customer must manually add employment income that they expect to be paid in the full reporting period. This is no different to the process for customers reporting early for non-STP employers.</p>

<p>If STP data becomes available to Services Australia after the relevant reporting period is complete, it does not pre-fill in a later reporting period for the customer to check.</p>

<p>Only STP pay events with a date paid in the relevant reporting period will pre-fill for customers.</p>

<p>An unemployment failure must be generated for PST-skilled Service Officers to investigate.</p>

<p>When unused leave and redundancy payments are reported with cessation data, the customer is asked to give the amount of days the leave covers or their average weekly wage, to determine the duration of any potential Income Maintenance Period (IMP). Service Officers must ensure that the leave period is reasonable. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-03.html#bp03_tbl_Common_question_20">Table 4, Item 20</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Services Australia uses the STP data from pay events to calculate a Pay Per Period (PayPP) amount. This is done by comparing the gross YTD (Year to Date) figure of all income components from the previous Pay Event with that of the current Pay Event. The difference between these amounts is the PayPP amount, and shows as <strong>Gross STP Income</strong>.</p>

<p>When presented with pre-filled STP data, customers must review and either confirm or change the PayPP details before the system applies the amounts to the record. Assessable PayPP amounts that have been confirmed are used to calculate a customer’s entitlement and are shown under <strong>Used in PayPP Calculation</strong>.</p>

<p>Income components that are assessable and included in the PayPP calculation show to customers when they are reporting through their Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-05.html#bp05_L3TT_STP_Allowance_t">Resources</a> to view which allowances are assessable.</p>

<p>Worker’s compensation payments paid by an STP employer, pre-fill as <strong>Paid leave - worker’s compensation</strong>.</p>

<p>The system will check the Compensation Management Summary (<strong>CMS</strong>) screen for a previous assessment by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT). Where this has already been assessed and is coded on CMS, the amounts reported through STP will not be applied to the record.</p>

<p>Where there has not been a previous assessment of the worker’s compensation, the pre-filled compensation amount will automatically load onto the <strong>EAPP</strong> screen for at least 2 fortnights. <a href="../compensation/117-01010040-01.html">The customer will need to complete a MOD C - Compensation Details form</a>. This can be completed verbally during the customer contact, or via a paper form. Customers reporting through their Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app will have an online task created to submit a MOD C.</p>
