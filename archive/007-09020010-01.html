<p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>surrogate birth mothers and birth mothers adopting out children or legally losing custody may not return to work and continue to receive the PPL period.

<p><strong>Full transfer of the PPL period </strong></p>

<p>If the primary claimant is transferring their full PPL period to a secondary claimant, the primary claimant needs to meet the PPL eligibility criteria from the child’s date of birth/adoption until the day before primary care of the child is transferred to the secondary claimant. </p>

<p>When the transfer of primary care date is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>the child’s date of birth/adoption</strong>, the primary claimant is only required to meet the limited PPL eligibility criteria. The secondary claimant must meet the full eligibility criteria from the child’s date of birth/adoption to the end of the PPL period </li>
		<li>
<strong>after the child is born (or enters care)</strong>, the primary claimant must meet the <strong>full PPL eligibility criteria</strong> for each day from the date the child is born (or enters care) until the day before primary care is transferred to the secondary claimant. The secondary claimant must satisfy <strong>the full PPL eligibility criteria</strong> for each day from the date primary care is transferred to them until the end of the PPL period.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Where the birth mother or initial primary claimant meets the limited eligibility criteria (for example has returned to work before submitting their PPL claim), the claim must NOT be assessed until both the primary and secondary claimants have&#58; </p>
		<ul>		<li>
submitted a claim for PPL  </li>
		<li>
claims ‘STArted’ or ‘ASS-PCB’ </li>
		<li>
not had a payability determination made for PPL (i.e. rejected/assessed or granted claim) for the child</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>This process is required to ensure the primary and secondary claimant’s PPL periods line up. </strong></p>

<p>If the secondary claimant's record is not linked to or is in a different Centrelink environment to that of the primary carer, a workaround for PPL secondary claimants may be required.</p>

<p><strong>Partial transfer of PPL period </strong></p>

<p>For a partial transfer, the primary claimant’s period and secondary claimant’s period must be a continuous period with no break in eligibility. </p>

<p>Primary claimants transferring some (but not all) of their PPL period to a secondary claimant must meet the <strong>full PPL eligibility</strong> criteria from the child’s date of birth/adoption to the end of their PPL period (transfer date). The secondary claimant must satisfy the <strong>full PPL eligibility criteria</strong> for each day from the date primary care of the child is transferred to them until the end of their PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Flexible PPL days</strong></p>

<p>The primary claimant can choose to give permission for another person (secondary claimant) to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days.</p>

<p>The secondary claimant is required to lodge their own PPL claim to nominate these days. A secondary claimant’s claim for Flexible PPL days can be lodged up to 2 years after the child’s birth or adoption. However, PPL claims that include a full or partial transfer of the PPL period must be lodged within one year of the child’s birth or adoption and there are time limits for claiming the maximum PPL period.</p>

<p>The primary claimant can remove permission&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
at any time during the pre-birth phase (pre-birth claims only), or</li>
		<li>
before a secondary claimant has claimed the Flexible PPL day</li>
		</ul>
<p>For the purposes of claiming Flexible PPL days, multiple secondary claimants can be linked to a child.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple birth</strong></p>

<p>For a <strong>multiple birth</strong>, PPL can only be paid for one child and the higher rate of NBS/NBU may be paid for the other children. However, if there was a significant delay between the births of the children from the same pregnancy, for example twins delivered 5+ days apart, the births may be considered separate birthing events and not part of a multiple birth. If approved these cases may qualify to be payable for each child. Cases with evidence of multiple birth with significant delay should be forwarded to the Families level 2 helpdesk for assessment.</p>

<p>Where multiple children are <strong>adopted</strong> as part of the same adoption process, PPL is only payable for one child.</p>

<p><strong>Assessable income</strong></p>

<p>Parental Leave Pay Scheme payments are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
taxable income and are included in a customer's adjusted taxable income for family assistance payments</li>
		<li>
treated as ordinary income for calculating the rate of payment for income support payments</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Service Officers <strong>do not</strong> code the PPL and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) income on the customer’s record. It will be automatically included for assessment when the PPL or DAP claim is actioned. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-04010000-01.html">Coding income and assets for Centrelink payments and services</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Any PPL and DAP payments are taken into consideration as income for customers claiming or renewing a Low Income Health Care Card.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility for other payments</strong></p>

<p>Customers (and/or their partner) cannot receive Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B at the same time as PPL.</p>

<p>One customer can receive PPL and <a href="../families/007-05010000-01.html">DAP</a> for the same child, however&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the PPL and DAP periods must be taken at different times, and </li>
		<li>
a maximum of 18 weeks can be paid to the one person</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> usually only the secondary claimant can claim PPL and DAP, as the primary claimant is generally not eligible for DAP. </p>

<p>A family can receive a maximum of 20 weeks PPL and DAP combined for the same child. For example, the primary claimant receives 18 weeks of PPL and their partner receives 2 weeks of DAP.</p>

<p>A customer can receive PPL for one child and DAP for another child at the same time.</p>

<p>Customers cannot receive&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
JobKeeper Payment for the same period they receive PPL</li>
		<li>
PPL and NBS/NBU for the same child. However, customers may change their claim choice and claim PPL after NBS/NBU has been paid. Any NBS/NBU paid to the customer will have to be repaid</li>
		</ul>
