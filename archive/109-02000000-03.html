Run the script for each decision the customer wants explained. See the <a href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-02000000-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples</li>
		<li>
Record the request for an explanation for the right decision</li>
		<li>
Run the script on the correct record. For example, the Assistance for Isolated Children applicant’s record rather than the student’s record</li>
		<li>
The script requests the logon details and Regional Office Code (ROC) of the original decision maker. If these are not available, for example, an automatic decision, the user should use their own logon and the customer’s local service centre ROC. If the request for explanation is about an assessment by a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) or a compensation team, use the ROC of the CAO or compensation team</li>
		<li>
The script will leave the explanation <strong>DOC</strong> open after it is created. Do <strong>not</strong> close the <strong>DOC</strong></li>
		<li>
Check contact details with the customer. Note in the <strong>DOC</strong> their preferred contact number and times</li>
		<li>
<a target="_blank" href="../self-service/133-05000000-03.html">Check subscription to Electronic Messaging and subscribe the customer</a> if appropriate</li>
		<li>
Tell the customer a skilled officer will call from an unidentified number. They will identify as being from Services Australia. They must conduct a proof of identity check before they can discuss the request for explanation</li>
		<li>
Consider any other appropriate actions. For example, <a target="_blank" href="../review-of-decision-and-appeals/109-04020000-03.html">applying the debt pause for a debt decision</a></li>
		<li>
For a social worker decision, go to the Worklist in Work Optimiser, unassign the work item and re-categorise it to <strong>ZIAM_ROD_EXP_SWO</strong></li>
		<li>
For a <strong>Fares Allowance (FAA)</strong> decision for Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy or Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) student, also create a <strong>Fares Allowance Appeal Fast Note</strong> after completing the script. See <a target="_blank" href="../students-and-trainees/010-04060000-03.html">FAA for YA, Austudy and PES students</a></li>
		<li>
For a <strong>Parenting Payment</strong> decision where an exemption from the activity test was not granted following the provision of a medical certificate, select these fields in the script&#58;</li>

<strong>Service Reason</strong>&#58; PPP or PPS</li>
