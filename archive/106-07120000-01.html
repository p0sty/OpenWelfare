<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Identifying_the">Identifying the risk of family and domestic violence</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>There are a number of signs that a customer may be affected by family and domestic violence. In all customer interactions, be alert and responsive to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
visual cues</li>
		<li>
conversational cues</li>
		<li>
administrative cues</li>
		</ul>
<p>If staff identify any of the above, this is a cue to ask a Risk Identification Question. There are a number of updates and referral options available for customers in need of immediate help or ongoing support. Refer to the Family and Domestic Violence Support Model and to <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Relationship_St">Relationship Status</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>A customer's relationship status lets Services Australia assess the current relationship of the customer and support policy requirements relating to payment entitlements. Some income support payments have different rates, depending on whether the customer is single or partnered. Partner income and assets tests may also affect eligibility.</p>

<p>If the customer is updating their relationship status due to separating from a relationship, there are key steps they should consider to keep their personal information safe. The sequence of these key steps is important and all updates need to be made separately for Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-22060707-01.html">Separating Safely - Protecting personal details</a>.</p>

<p>Assessing the customer's relationship status makes sure they receive the correct entitlements. The agency stores and records a customer's relationship status on the Marital Status (<strong>MS</strong>) screen. Information on the <strong>MS</strong> screen is the primary source for partner linking information and details the following&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
relationship status type&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
Partnered statuses&#58; de facto (DEF), married (MAR), registered (REG)</li>
			<li>
Single statuses&#58; separated (SEP), single (SIN), widowed (WID), divorced (DIV)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
if the customer or their partner has permission to enquire (PPE) about the person they are linked to</li>
		<li>
any relationship qualifier codes (Qualifier Code) relevant to their relationship. For example, partner is currently in respite care</li>
		<li>
periods for which the relationship status/relationship qualifier code applies</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> there is no minimum time period required to have elapsed before a relationship can be considered a de facto. Time period rules apply to Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY and Disability Support Pension (under 21) to consider customers independent based on the length of their relationship. See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120000-05.html">Resources</a> for further information.</p>

<p>The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a list of all possible <strong>MS</strong> screen codes for the <strong>Marital Status</strong> field and <strong>Qualifier Code</strong> field (relationship qualifier code).</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Partner_linking">Partner linking</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>The system creates a partner link for all relationship status circumstances where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer is partnered, <strong>and</strong> </li>
		<li>
the partner's Customer Reference Number (CRN) is provided</li>
		</ul>
<p>The partnered generic link does not include a description of the type of relationship the customer is in. Its existence only indicates that the customer is partnered. The absence of a partnered generic link indicates that a customer does not have a partner.</p>

<p>It is also used to record information common to a couple such as address and accommodation details. This supports the linking process and reduces re-keying of information on both records. The following information is required prior to commencing the linking process&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer's relationship status type</li>
		<li>
confirmation of the relationship by both the customer and the partner</li>
		<li>
permission for the customer to enquire about their partner's information and vice versa, and</li>
		<li>
the partner's name and date of birth</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> confirmation of the relationship by both the customer and partner is required to update and link their records. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05010000-01.html">Change in relationship status from single to partnered</a>. Where there is documented family and domestic violence on the customer or partner's record, see <a href="../help-in-an-emergency/003-15000000-01.html">Family and domestic violence</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Relationship_qu">Relationship qualifier codes</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Service Officers can use relationship qualifier codes to treat customers differently to their recorded relationship status. The agency records the codes on the <strong>MS</strong> screen <strong>Qualifier Code</strong> field if applicable.</p>

<p>There are single and partnered relationship qualifier codes. The agency only applies partnered relationship qualifier codes to a partnered relationship status, while single codes to a single relationship status. Where a relationship qualifier code is recorded for a partnered relationship status, a matching relationship qualifier code is applied to the partner.</p>

<p>When a relationship qualifier code is applied it can sometimes have the opposite effect, that is, a Service Officer can treat a single status customer as partnered or vice versa. Some codes may not have any impact on the rate of payment. The <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120000-05.html">Resources</a> page contains a list of relationship qualifier codes Service Officers can record for a customer and their partner.</p>

<p>When a customer's record has a relationship qualifier code applied, the agency does regular reviews to make sure the customer’s circumstances have not changed. If a warning presents while finalising the Relationship Qualifier activity on the <strong>MS</strong> screen, Service Officers must follow the advice and manually code the review. It is equally important for Service Officers to action reviews appropriately when they mature to avoid potential overpayments to the customer and/or their partner/ex-partner.</p>

<h3>Confirming the need for a Member of a Couple (MoC) assessment</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
Staff must conduct checks at the first touch point to confirm if there is a need for a MoC or Separated under one Roof (SUOR) assessment if&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
there is an indication a MoC relationship may exist, or </li>
			<li>
Relationship Details (SS284/SS293) forms have been received</li>		</ul>
		<li>
See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-19071608-01.html">Confirming the need for a MoC assessment</a></li>
		</ul>
<h3>MoC and SUOR assessments</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
MoC assessments are completed by specialist MoC processing staff</li>
		<li>
MoC assessments can also be completed due to&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
internal data matching and profiling</li>
			<li>
external data matching (e.g. Australia Taxation Officer, Department of Defence)</li>
			<li>
information from the public and officer referrals (tip offs/fraud)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
When conducting or completing follow-up coding for a MoC or SUOR assessment, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120010-01.html">MoC and SUOR assessments</a></li>
		</ul>
<h3>Retrospective MoC assessments</h3>


<p><strong>Undisclosed MoC relationships</strong><br>If there is evidence of a previously undisclosed MoC relationship that is recognised by either MoC processing staff or any another Service Officer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Escalate the assessment using the <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-09110000-01.html">Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption</a> system </li>
		<li>
MoC processing staff <strong>must not</strong> do the retrospective MoC assessment</li>
		<li>
An Intelligence Analysis Unit, will assess the customer’s past entitlement</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosed MoC relationships with no FDV identified</strong><br>If there is a change in circumstances since the initial trigger of the MoC assessment (form issued), MoC processing staff must&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
make an assessment, and</li>
		<li>
decide if the customer was in a MoC relationship for a past period</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is to make sure the customer received the correct entitlement. For example, a customer self-declares they are now partnered to the person for whom the MoC assessment triggered.<br><strong>Note</strong>&#58; if a customer self-declares they are in a relationship that started on a date in the past, there is no need to report suspected fraud or conduct a MoC assessment. Staff must issue a MOD P. See <a href="../ongoing-contact/102-05010000-01.html">Change in relationship status from single to partnered</a></p>

<p><strong>Disclosed relationships with FDV identified<br></strong>A MoC assessment is not required if the customer&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
is experiencing FDV </li>
		<li>
does not dispute they are partnered or were previously partnered, but did not advise the agency).</li>
		</ul>
<p>It may be appropriate to consider if there is a ‘special reason’ (due to the presence of FDV), to treat the customer as single under Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1991. This applies in either of the following circumstances&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the customer is still partnered despite the presence of FDV</li>
		<li>
the customer is no longer partnered, but failed to advise the agency of their relationship</li>
		</ul>
<p>An assessment of the customer’s relationship status is needed for the past period (and ongoing if they remain partnered) if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are currently in a relationship not yet disclosed and recorded, or</li>
		<li>
were in an undisclosed relationship for more than 14 days before notification</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is not appropriate to simply issue a Partner Details form (MOD P) or link the customer to their partner (when they are also a Centrelink customer). Assess their entire circumstances, including their FDV situation, first. </p>

<p>The <strong>presence of FDV may indicate there is a special reason to treat a person as not being in a member of a couple relationship</strong>. It must be considered when making a retrospective Section 24 assessment or for ongoing entitlements if the customer does not separate.</p>

<p>For Section 24 assessments, see <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120080-03.html">Treatment of a partnered person as single under section 24 new determinations</a>.</p>

<h3>SUOR reviews</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
All SUOR reviews <strong>must</strong> be done at appropriate timeframes, depending on the customer’s circumstances, based on the SUOR review guide.</li>
		<li>
Trained MoC processing staff conduct all SUOR reviews</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-19111344-01.html">Member of a couple reviews - SUOR</a></li>
		</ul>
<h3>Section 24 assessments</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
A customer may not request a Section 24 assessment, as they may not be aware of it. If the customer's circumstances indicate a Section 24 assessment may be warranted, Service Officers must offer the customer to test their entitlement</li>
		<li>
When a customer is requesting an initial Section 24 assessment, including new claim processing, if possible, do it first contact. If the Service Officer does not have the skill set to do the Section 24 assessment, a referral may be required</li>
		<li>
If the Section 24 assessment is for a customer who <strong>lives overseas</strong>, Centrelink International Services (CIS) conduct the assessment. If the customer lives in Australia but their partner lives overseas, the assessment is done through normal channels (not by CIS)</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../initial-contact-general/106-07120080-01.html">Treatment of a partnered person as single under Section 24 new determinations</a></li>
		</ul>
<h3>Section 24 reviews</h3>

		<ul>		<li>
Section 24 reviews <strong>must</strong> be done at appropriate timeframes, depending on the customer’s circumstances, based on the Section 24 review guide</li>
		<li>
These reviews are completed at first touch point if the Service Officer has been trained in Section 24 assessments</li>
		<li>
A referral option is available if a staff member has not been trained</li>
		<li>
See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-19111307-01.html">Member of a couple reviews - Section 24</a></li>
		</ul>
<h3>Customers living overseas</h3>
