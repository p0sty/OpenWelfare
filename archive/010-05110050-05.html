<p>Students will not always maintain a steady workload for the duration of a long course. A full-time student may choose to do some of the course on a part-time basis and vice versa. If possible, each section of the course should be looked at separately.</p>

<p>Most courses are divided into academic periods. The standard divisions are&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
whole years</li>
		<li>
semesters (two periods per year), or</li>
		<li>
trimesters (three periods per year)</li>
		</ul>
<p>It is easy to look at each period separately in these cases but some courses, particularly those offered by private providers, do not have any divisions. These types of courses often have a rolling start date (for example, the course starts any Monday) and will finish a set number of weeks later. In these cases, the course is looked at as a whole.</p>

<p>Where study loads for study periods are added together for the purpose of satisfying full-time study load requirements, these periods are counted as full-time when assessing satisfactory progress. For example, a student is part-time (0.250 EFTSL) in semester one and full-time (0.500 EFTSL) in semester two. Aggregation assessment is completed and the customer is paid as a full-time student for both semesters. This equals 0.750 EFSTL, allowing the customer to meet the satisfactory progress rules as they have been undertaking an aggregated full time study load over the year.    </p>

<p>The general rule for Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) is that a student can continue to be paid up to the point at which they exceed the allowable time for the course. For example, a student in a three year bachelor degree who has already completed four years of study at that level would be expected to have completed the course. The delay in completing the course is not always the fault of the student, however. For this reason, allowance is made to disregard some, or all, earlier study in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The following <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-02080100-01.html">periods of study can be disregarded</a>&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a failed year (or part of a year) if failure was due to illness or other circumstances beyond the control of the student</li>
		<li>
time spent in a course that has been <strong>permanently</strong> discontinued because of circumstances beyond the control of the student</li>
		<li>
time spent studying in a course that has been completed but which, because of illness, the customer cannot use in any of the trades or professions for which the course is appropriate</li>
		<li>
study in a course which was not at the time approved for a Commonwealth student income support scheme</li>
		<li>
study for which the student could not have been paid income support due to academic progress rules</li>
		<li>
study in a course which is the normal prerequisite for the current course</li>
		<li>
any study in a Vocational Education and Training (VET) course where the normal length of the course is one year or less</li>
		<li>
study undertaken in a course more than ten years ago unless the course was subsequently completed less than ten years ago</li>
		<li>
study at a foreign institution (unless it counts towards an approved Australian course)</li>
		<li>
study from which the student withdrew if the institution did not count that withdrawal as a failure</li>		</ul>

<p>For current full-time students <strong>only</strong> the normal minimum duration of a completed course is taken into account, whether or not the person actually studied for longer than that.</p>

<p>Therefore courses completed previously are counted as the <strong>lesser</strong> of&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
minimum time or</li>
		<li>
the actual time spent</li>
		</ul>
<p>For current concessional students the actual time the course took to complete should be counted.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1&#58;</strong> David has completed a three year Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree over four and a half years full-time. There was no particular reason for this or extenuating circumstances and none of the study can be disregarded.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If David applies for another course at the Bachelor level the BA will be counted as three years of previous study, as it is the lesser of minimum time and actual time spent</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2&#58;</strong> Wendy is a highly motivated student who completed her BA in two and a half years by undertaking more than the normal study load each semester.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If Wendy applies for another course at the Bachelor level, the BA will be counted as two and a half years of previous study</li>		</ul>

<p>A student who is undertaking at least 75% of the normal study load (or 66% if a <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-05110020-01.html">study load concession</a> has been granted) in a period is considered to be a full-time student for payment purposes. They would also be counted as a full-time student for previous study calculations. For example, a study load of four of the normal five subjects in a semester is counted as 50% of the year's study load (not 40%).</p>

<p>To calculate the total amount of study for a number of academic periods it is easiest to measure each period as a percentage of a whole academic year. Therefore, a semester's full-time study load would equal 50% of a year, a trimester's 33.3% and so on.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If the previous study was <strong>part-time</strong> then the appropriate fraction would be used (for example a student undertakes two subjects out of the usual four in a semester - this would equal 25% of a full year's study)</li>
		<li>
If the previous study was undertaken as <strong>25% concessional study load</strong>, then the previous study is treated as equal to the minimum amount of time that a <strong>full-time</strong> student would have taken to complete the previous study. For example, four years of 25% study load equals one year of full-time study</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> A student completed 4 years as a 25% concessional study-load student and is now a full-time student. His/her previous study is counted as one year because this is how long a full-time student would have taken to complete the same study.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a customer overloads in a semester or year, it is counted as 50% (0.5) or 100% (1.0) respectively, and not the overloaded figure. For example, if a customer undertook 125% of the normal full-time workload in a year, it is counted as 100% (1.0) of workload.</p>

<p>The <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-07010030-01.html">allowable time</a> is twice the length of time it would take a full-time student to complete the CURRENT course being studied.</p>

<p>If the previous study was undertaken as&#58;</p>

a 25% concessional study load</li>
		<li>
a full-time study load</li>
		<li>
a 66% concessional study load, or</li>
		<li>
any period of study with less than 25% study load would be counted on a pro-rata basis as the appropriate <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-05110050-05.html#bp05_tbl_Clarification_o_4">percentage study load</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>then the previous study is treated the same. It is counted as full years, regardless of whether study was 25% concessional or full-time or whether PES was paid.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation&#58;</strong> PES is payable for twice the length of time it would take a full-time student to complete the <strong>current</strong> course being studied. So, if the current course is 3 years full-time, then PES is payable for 6 years. Any time previously undertaken at the same level is subtracted from the 6 years. It is not relevant whether the previous study was full-time or 25% concessional or whether PES was paid.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> A 25% concessional study-load student beginning a 3-year course had previously undertaken 3 years study at the same level, some as a 25% concessional study-load student, some as a full-time student. PES was paid only for one year. Those 3 past years study are counted as 3 years so the student can be paid PES for a further 3 years if she continues as a 25% concessional study-load student.</p>

<p>The result of the <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-05110050-03.html#bp03_tbl_Assessing_satis_Step03">calculation of satisfactory progress</a> can be used to determine when allowable time would be expected to end and entitlement cease.</p>

<p>Satisfactory progress is determined at the relevant date. This means that a student who has any allowable time remaining (however little) may be paid up to the end of that study period. If there would still be allowable time remaining at that point, then payment could continue after that. A student can therefore be told that they may be eligible for two years but after that, further payment could not be made at the current level of study.</p>

<p><strong>Example&#58;</strong> Akiko is starting a two year TAFE course, which would have allowable time of 2.5 years (minimum time plus 6 months). The course is divided into trimesters. Akiko has undertaken previous study at this level (Level C) which has been assessed as 1.5 years. At enrolment day of her first year, the time already spent in study at the same level is under allowable time and so Akiko is eligible for payment for her first year of study. After a full year's study, the time spent in study at this level would have reached 2.5 years. At this point Akiko has reached but not exceeded the allowable time so can be paid to the start of the next study period when the allowable time is exceeded.</p>

<p>Centrelink would be able to inform Akiko when initially applying that the payments would not continue to the end of the course.</p>
