<p>A Job Plan is an Employment Pathway Plan or Individual Participation Plan for the purpose of social security law.</p>

<p>Job seekers with <a href="../job-seekers/001-09000000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a> must agree to a <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100000-01.html">Job Plan</a> to qualify for income support payments. A Job Plan records the requirements the job seeker will do to meet their mutual obligation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> from 4 December 2021, job seekers in Workforce Australia Online who are subject to RapidConnect will need to complete a career profile before they are presented with a Job Plan.</p>

<p>Job seekers are either Centrelink or Employment Services Provider managed. Staff are unable to negotiate a Job Plan for provider managed job seekers. The organisation responsible for the ongoing management of the job seeker will negotiate their Job Plan.</p>

<p>All job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must negotiate and agree to a Job Plan within&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
4 business days of their first regular payment, or</li>
		<li>
within 14 days of a change of circumstance</li>
		</ul>
<p>To negotiate a Job Plan, job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must have an active Job Seeker Identification status with one of the following registration types&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Fully Eligible Participant (FEP)</li>
		<li>
Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No Remote Referral Required (NRRR) job seeker, or</li>
		<li>
Remote fully eligible</li>
		</ul>
<p>The Job Plan must be tailored to the job seeker's needs.</p>

<p>A compulsory Job Plan must be negotiated for job seekers with mutual obligation requirements except where the job seeker has a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
current temporary exemption from their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
pending Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) and their capacity to participate is undetermined</li>

<p>Staff must identify where a provider managed job seeker should be Centrelink managed, for example where they are fully meeting their requirements through an approved activity or programme. After coding the Activity and Exemption (<strong>AEX</strong>) screen, <strong>do not</strong> attempt to negotiate a Job Plan until the job seeker's record changes to Centrelink managed. The exception to this is job seekers participating in a Disability Employment Services (DES) program and doing paid work. <strong>See also&#58;</strong> <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070070-01.html">Paid work as an approved activity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Options_for_neg">Options for negotiating Job Plans</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Job Plans may be negotiated by suitably skilled staff either in person or over the phone where all necessary documentation and/or information is available. Job seekers must formally <a href="../job-seekers/001-09100010-05.html">agree with the Job Plan</a> either by signing a printed copy, or by using their <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> online account (not including the Centrelink app) to provide agreement. Job Plans cannot be finalised by verbal agreement.</p>

<p>Some Centrelink managed job seekers who have signed up for Online Services and are fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements can have their Job Plan updated automatically when the requirement end date is reached by completing an Online Task. These job seekers then use the 'View and Agree Job Plan' online service to agree to their Job Plan.</p>

<p><img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> If the Job Plan is negotiated via phone, the job seeker should access their online account and finalise the plan while they are still on the phone. It will be available immediately. If the job seeker does not have an online account, the Job Plan can be mailed to them, or they can go to a service centre to sign it. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> remote job seekers can post their signed Job Plans.</p>

<p>The job seeker does not need to agree to the Job Plan immediately but must agree to it within 28 days. The following timeframes apply&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
2 days - reminder message for job seeker with an online account</li>
		<li>
14 days - reminder letter</li>
		<li>
28 days - payments suspended</li>

<p>Services Australia is responsible for ensuring that Centrelink managed job seekers have <a href="../job-seekers/001-09070000-01.html">appropriate requirements in their Job Plan</a>.</p>

<p>An appropriate Job Plan must be negotiated with a job seeker by the agency where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
their Job Plan is no longer current (for example, a job-seeker with voluntary work as their approved requirement commences part-time work)</li>
		<li>
any requirement in the Centrelink negotiated Job Plan is more than 12 months old</li>
		<li>
the job seeker is now Centrelink managed as they have commenced an activity which will fully meet their mutual obligation requirements</li>
		<li>
the job seeker is returning to an income support payment, even if the requirements in their new Job Plan are the same as they had during a previous period of payment</li>
		</ul>
<p>Some job seekers will have their approved part-time work (PTW) or self-employment (SEL) requirement auto-updated if they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
are a principal carer, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
are receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Single, or Youth Allowance (job seeker), <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
have declared in the last 2 consecutive fortnights that they have worked at least 30 hours each fortnight and earned income equal to or above the national minimum wage</li>
		</ul>
<p>A new Centrelink Managed Job Plan must still be negotiated for these job seekers.</p>

		<div class="block">

<p>At new claim, where a job seeker's circumstances, for example, partial capacity to work (PCW) or the requirements they are already undertaking, mean they can be Centrelink managed, staff should negotiate Job Plans as part of the new claim finalisation process.</p>

<p>If a job seeker is proposing to do an activity that will fully meet their requirements, or they cannot yet provide the required verification at new claim, their requirement must be approved as soon as possible after grant. In the meantime, the job seeker must be referred to an Employment Service and commence meeting the requirements of a provider negotiated Job Plan. The job seeker will be provider managed until Centrelink has the information and verification needed to approve an activity that is fully meeting their requirements.</p>

<p>If a Job Seeker Snapshot is run during the job seeker's online claim appointment resulting in a ‘pending’ status, a job plan <strong>cannot</strong> be negotiated until their&#58;</p>
