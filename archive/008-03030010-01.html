<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_Medical_evidenc">Requirement for medical evidence</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customerâ€™s claiming DSP must provide Services Australia with medical evidence for the disability or medical condition(s) affecting their ability to function. Insufficient medical evidence will generally result in a DSP claim being rejected.</p>

<p>The medical evidence required depends on each customer's circumstances. Most customers must provide comprehensive evidence, however some may only need to provide certain information, or may not need to provide any new evidence.</p>

<p>Do not ask customers to provide extra medical evidence if it is clear their claim can be manifestly rejected on non-medical grounds. This includes when their income clearly exceeds the relevant limits.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_What_is_medical">Medical evidence</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Medical evidence includes documents written by a medical practitioner (such as the customer's treating doctor) and other registered health or allied health professionals. This evidence should support the information provided in the medical details section of the DSP claim.</p>

<p>Statements from the customer or their nominee are not considered medical evidence. This also applies to letters/information from a non-health professional, such as a teacher. However, this information may be taken into account as part of the assessment.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>Customers must provide medical evidence when they lodge their online claim. This presents as a required task at the <strong>Next Steps</strong> section of the DSP online claim. If no medical evidence is uploaded, the claim cannot be submitted.</p>

<p>There are some exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>Customers who claim <a href="../people-with-disability/008-02080000-01.html">JobSeeker Payment (JSP) (Provisional)</a> within the online claim for DSP can submit both claims without providing medical evidence. This allows processing of the JSP (P) online claim while the customer gathers medical evidence for DSP. Generally, a DSP claim will be rejected if medical evidence is insufficient.</p>

<p>Customers who meet the exceptional circumstance criteria can submit their DSP online claim without uploading all required documents. These claims will be referred to the Medical Assessment Team (MAT), using a separate work item. The MAT assessor may contact the customer or health professional to discuss medical evidence before making a recommendation. See the <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03030010-03.html">Process</a> page for exception criteria.</p>

<p>The agency can provide support to vulnerable or at risk customers for whom it is difficult to obtain basic medical evidence. For example, people who disengaged from health services due to being homeless, living in a remote community or having an undiagnosed mental health condition.</p>

<p>For each condition that significantly affects the customer's functional capacity and ability to work, information is generally required about the&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>diagnosis</strong> of the condition, including whether the diagnosis is confirmed, when the condition was diagnosed, and the details of the health professional who made the diagnosis</li>
		<li>
<strong>symptoms and functional impact</strong>, including current symptoms of the customer's condition (persisting despite treatment, aids, equipment or assistive technology), when the symptoms started (date of onset), the severity, frequency and duration of symptoms, and how the conditions and treatment impact on the customer's ability to function in day-to-day life including at work</li>
		<li>
<strong>prognosis</strong>, including how long the condition is expected to affect the customer's functional capacity, and whether the condition is likely to improve, remain the same or get worse, and</li>
		<li>
<strong>treatment</strong> and care, including the type of treatment undertaken in the past, current treatment, planned treatment (including if on a waiting list), expected impact of current and future treatment and any requirement for nursing home or palliative care</li>
		</ul>
<p>This does <strong>not</strong> mean the customer is required to provide documentary evidence covering all of these points. However, the customer should provide as much medical evidence as they can so the agency can complete a thorough assessment of the DSP claim.</p>

<p>In certain cases, verification of the diagnosis may be enough to establish medical eligibility for DSP without the need for a comprehensive Job Capacity Assessment. For example, if a customer provides evidence from their treating doctor confirming diagnosis of a 'List 1' manifest condition, the MAT may determine this is sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of the customer's disability or medical condition is usually provided by a medical practitioner. Specialist evidence or specialist confirmation of the treating doctor's diagnosis is required for some medical conditions including&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an intellectual impairment. An assessment of intellectual function and assessment of adaptive behaviour from a registered psychologist is required, or a report from a special school which includes details of these assessments. Any evidence provided must include information supported by a psychologist about the person's IQ score, or their ability to undergo IQ testing</li>
		<li>
a mental health condition such as depression, anxiety or schizophrenia. The diagnosis must be made by a psychiatrist, or by another medical practitioner with supporting evidence from a registered psychologist</li>
		<li>
an ear condition affecting hearing or balance. Diagnosis must be made by a medical practitioner, with supporting evidence from an audiologist or an ear, nose and throat specialist</li>
		<li>
an eye condition affecting vision. Diagnosis must be made by a medical practitioner, with supporting report from an ophthalmologist or ophthalmic surgeon (a report completed by an optometrist is not sufficient)</li>
		</ul>
<p>In limited cases, a <a target="_blank" href="../people-with-disability/008-03030020-01.html">diagnosis of a medical condition can be provided by an Assessment Services Psychologist Specialist Assessment report</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_New_medical_evi">New medical evidence not required in some circumstances</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>In some cases, new medical evidence is not required for a DSP new claim. For example&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
a customer has previously lodged medical evidence and this evidence is still current and relevant to the customer's circumstances, such as a previous assessment of intellectual function and adaptive behaviour, or</li>
		<li>
there is a current and valid Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) on the customer's record, such as when the customer&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
is invited to claim DSP as a result of a recently completed assessment</li>
			<li>
has claimed DSP previously (and was rejected on non-medical grounds where medical eligibility was recommended) and there has been no significant change in their medical conditions since the assessment</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p>If there is a current and valid JCA, the customer will still need to undergo a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) with a Government-contracted Doctor, excluding if the customer is manifestly eligible for DSP.</p>

<p>If a Service Officer determines there is a current and valid assessment or current medical evidence for a customer claiming via an online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC), the required task can be marked as <strong>Not required</strong> or as <strong>Provided</strong> via the Request and Manage Customer Tasks (RMCT) guided procedure.</p>

<h2 id="bp01_L2GT_No_medical_evid">No medical evidence provided</h2>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>If <strong>no</strong> medical evidence has been provided with a DSP new claim within the required timeframe (usually 14 days), the claim will likely be rejected without further notice unless&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the medical details section of the claim indicates a likely manifest medical condition or other serious health condition(s) which may impact the customer's ability to provide evidence (for example, in intensive care)</li>
		<li>
the customer has recently turned 16 years of age and was previously assessed as a profoundly disabled child or as having a very severe disability or medical condition for the purposes of Carer Payment</li>
		<li>
the claim or the customer's record indicates a vulnerability issue (for example, homeless, living in a remote community)</li>
		<li>
the customer was invited to make a further claim by the agency or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) as part of a review of a decision</li>
		<li>
the customer recently lodged medical evidence prior to the claim, and it is clear the evidence was lodged to support the claim</li>
		</ul>
<p>If the customer subsequently provides the required medical evidence (and any other information), within 13 weeks of the rejection decision, the claim may be re-opened and reassessed. This does not need an application for a formal review of the decision order for the customer's claim to be reconsidered.</p>
