<p>Customers can request their concession card to be issued without their partner's name, but still show details of any dependent children. For more information, see <a href="../additional-products-and-services/101-06060010-01.html">Preferences for concession cards</a>.</p>

<p>A difference between the date the payment is granted and the 'date of grant' on the concession card would usually be due to the customer travelling overseas or variations in income for Family Tax Benefit affecting HCC entitlement.</p>

<p>If a customer's Health Care Card start date is backdated, such as when claiming an income support/supplement payment that has an associated concession card, the customer may be able to claim reimbursement for expenses, such as Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medication purchases, incurred in the period from the backdated start date to the present. Advise the customer to obtain a PBS receipt for the prescription/medical treatment.
