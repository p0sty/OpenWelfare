<p>A person was entitled to an ESS payment for a FTB child if one of the following applied&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
On 14 October 2008, they were eligible for FTB Part A at a rate greater than nil for the FTB child. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> this includes recipients who were entitled to FTB Part A but who choose to be paid zero rate FTB. A recipient did <strong>not</strong> have to be current on FTB on 14 October 2008 to get the ESS payment, but must have been <strong>eligible</strong> for FTB Part A on that day</li>
		<li>
An FTB instalment, past period or bereavement claim was granted for the person that includes 14 October 2008 with a Part A rate greater than nil and the rate included the FTB child</li>
		<li>
The key factor of eligibility to the ESS payment was being <strong>entitled</strong> to FTB Part A on 14 October 2008. FTB eligibility on this date can be confirmed by the recipient's FTB reconciliation for 2008-09.</li>
		<li>
If the recipient did <strong>not</strong> qualify for ESS, as they were <strong>not</strong> in receipt of FTB Part A on14 October 2008, they may be entitled to ESS under the Administrative Scheme. For information on eligibility, see <a>Item 1 in the Information on claiming ESS under the Administrative Scheme</a> table</li>		</ul>

<p>Automatic ESS payments were issued in the period 8-19 December 2008 to instalment recipients and paid on the same day as their regular FTB payment. This included those who were FTB Part A current at zero rate due to a payment choice.</p>

<p>Recipients not paid in the 8-19 December 2008 period were paid by one of the following methods&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an arrears payment when their FTB instalment claim was granted</li>
		<li>
when they lodge an FTB lump sum claim at the end of the year (if eligible)</li>
		<li>
as part of reconciliation if they had an entitlement</li>
		</ul>
<p>For FTB recipients to be eligible for ESS as a result of reconciliation or lump sum claim processing, 2008-09 tax returns for the recipient and their partner (if applicable) were required to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) by 30 June 2011. Returns lodged after this date will mean the recipient is a late lodger and ESS cannot be paid.</p>

<p>There were 3 ways in which a person may have been entitled to an ESS payment under the Administrative Scheme&#58;</p>

<p><strong>Special Circumstances</strong></p>

<p>Under this category, a person would have been entitled to an ESS payment under the Administrative Scheme if the person was entitled to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB Part A for an FTB child who entered the person's ongoing care during the period 15 October - 31 December 2008, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the person was entitled to FTB Part A at any time during the period 1 July- 13 October 2008, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
there were special circumstances relating to why the person was not entitled to FTB Part A for the child for 14 October 2008</li>
		</ul>
<p>This covers, but is not limited to, cases where 14 October 2008 was within the period between a person losing and regaining care of a child (a temporary loss of care is why the person was not entitled to FTB Part A), and there were special circumstances as to why the child was not in the person's care on 14 October 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Formal foster carers</strong></p>

<p>Under this category, a person would have been entitled to an ESS payment under the Administrative Scheme if the person was entitled to&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
FTB Part A for an FTB child who entered the person's ongoing care during the period 15 October - 31 December 2008, <strong>and</strong></li>
		<li>
the person was entrusted with the ongoing care of the child under a formal foster care arrangement</li>
		</ul>
<p>This covers cases where there was a placement of a child with the carer, under formal child protection processes, during the period 15 October - 31 December 2008. As there is a requirement for ongoing care, it excluded placements that were likely to be less than 26 weeks.</p>

<p>Evidence of care arrangements needed to be provided to Services Australia. See <a>Item 3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Non-parent carers</strong></p>

<p>Under this category, a person would have been entitled to an ESS payment under the Administrative Scheme if the person was entitled to&#58;</p>

FTB Part A for an FTB child under 16 years of age who entered the person's ongoing care during the period 15 October - 31 December 2008, and</li>
		<li>
the person was a  non-parent carer of the child (such as a grandparent) and had been entrusted with the ongoing care of the child due to an inability or failure of the child's parents to provide care of the child</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is similar in nature to the formal foster care category due to there being an inability or failure of the child's parents to provide care of the child.</p>

<p>Foster carers were required to provide evidence of the placement and expected duration from the relevant state/territory child protection authority.</p>

<p>If there was no placement of the child under formal child protection processes, other evidence needed to be obtained as part of the claim process to support a finding that the person had care of the child due to an inability or failure of the child's parents to provide care of the child.</p>

<p>This may have involved contact with the parents to confirm that they did not have care and the reason and/or contact with another relevant person or organisation (for example, a child protection authority) to verify the circumstances leading to the carer having care of the child.</p>

<p>This may have required an assessment by a Centrelink social worker, in consultation with the relevant state/territory child protection authority.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A child protection authority may have been aware of the circumstances relating to the care of the child, and held discussions with the parents and the carer, without the need for formal child protection processes.</p>

<p>It may have also included cases where the child protection authority was not aware of the circumstances relating to the care of the child, for example, the parents had abandoned the care of the child.</p>

<p>To receive ESS under the Administrative Scheme a claim must have been lodged by 29 January 2010. Claims lodged after 29 January 2010 will be rejected. Payments are not automatic.</p>

<p>For recipients paid as a result of reconciliation or lump sum claim, 2008-09 tax returns (for recipient or partner) were required to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) by 30 June 2011. Returns lodged after this date mean he recipient is a late lodger and ESS cannot be paid.
