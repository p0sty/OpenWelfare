Allowable essential expenses are expenses a care recipient <strong>must</strong> pay to meet their daily living needs while in care</li>

A care recipient's legal obligations are not necessarily negated when moving into residential care.

As such, a person's obligation to pay items such as a mortgage, council rates, insurance costs and utility bills remains</li>

Some essential expenses are legislated, while other costs may be discretionary</li>

Discretionary costs can be assessed on a case by case basis</li>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a care recipient claims to be in financial hardship as a result of ‘misappropriation of funds’, they need to provide a letter of evidence form their solicitor to demonstrate that proceedings have begun to attempt to recover the funds. This may not necessarily result in the care recipient and/or the perpetrator having to attend court. The funds that were misappropriated must also have been part of the assets that was included in the original aged care means assessment.</p>

<p>Eligible care recipients have the option to obtain free legal assistance and grants via Legal Aid. Eligibility for this service is dependent upon meeting a means test criteria. If the care recipient does not qualify for the service, then they may not be deemed to be in financial hardship and therefore ineligible for free legal assistance.</p>

<p><strong>How lump sum accommodation payments are assessed</strong></p>

<p>Lump sum accommodation payments are not assets that cannot be sold or borrowed against for hardship assessments.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If a care recipient has paid a lump sum accommodation payment and the balance is above the hardship assistance assets threshold, they are ineligible for hardship assistance</li>
		<li>
If both members of the couple are residing in permanent residential care, and</li>
			<ul>			<li>
a lump sum payment has been made by either member of the couple</li>
			<li>
the lump sum remains an assessable asset subject to the 50%/50% split for hardship assistance</li>		</ul>
		<li>
A care recipient can have a DAP deducted from their RAD when they request it in writing</li>
		<li>
Any amount specified in Fees and Payments Principles that the care recipient has agreed to pay in writing can be deducted when agreed by the care recipient and the provider</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Pre 1 July 2014</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
A pre 1 July 2014 care recipient needs to negotiate a change to the bond amount with the provider&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
if they have agreed to an accommodation bond above their means (above the allowable threshold based on their assessed assets)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
Reject the hardship claim if the care recipient does not provide evidence of the attempt to renegotiate</li>
		<li>
If the accommodation bond amount is not able to be renegotiated, and evidence of this has been provided&#58; </li>
			<ul>			<li>
the accommodation bond can be assessed as an asset that cannot be sold or borrowed against</li>
			</ul>			</ul>
<p><strong>Post 1 July 2014</strong></p>

<p>The post 1 July 2014 accommodation payment arrangements give the care recipient and the provider the flexibility to negotiate an accommodation price greater than the care recipient's net assets.</p>

<p>A care recipient can choose to pay the accommodation in a&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
lump-sum refundable accommodation deposit (RAD)</li>
		<li>
daily accommodation payments (DAP), or</li>
		<li>
a combination of both</li>
		</ul>
<p>For hardship assistance, there is <strong>no </strong>requirement for the care recipient to renegotiate the RAD/DAP with the provider, even if the payment amount is greater than the care recipient's total assessable assets.</p>

<p>Hardship assistance is applied as a daily subsidy. Hardship assistance cannot be granted if a RAD above the threshold has already been paid. However, it can be granted where&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
an unpaid liability exists for a RAD, or</li>
		<li>
partial payment below the threshold has been made and the total of all remaining assets (including partial RAD payment) is below the threshold</li>		</ul></td>

refundable accommodation contribution (RAC)</li>		</ul>

A daily payment is defined as a&#58;</li>
			<ul>			<li>
daily accommodation payment (DAP), or</li>
			<li>
daily accommodation contribution (DAC)</li>		</ul>
		<li>
A provider must deduct a daily payment (or any other amounts as specified in the Fees and Payments Principles) from a refundable deposit if the care recipient has requested this in writing</li>
			<ul>			<li>
In agreements where the care recipient has elected to pay their accommodation payment via a combination of refundable deposit and daily payments, it is possible to draw down on the refundable deposit to the pay the daily payments</li>		</ul>
		<li>
If the provider refuses to vary the agreement to deduct daily payments from a refundable deposit, the refundable deposit remains an assessable asset</li>
			<ul>			<li>
The care recipient will need to discuss the matter with the provider or the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner</li>		</ul>

Care recipients may be eligible for an income support payment, a payment under the asset hardship provisions or qualify for the Home Equity Access Scheme</li>
