<p>Joe attends his ESAt interview after having supplied a medical certificate to Services Australia for his bad back. He has a history (over 18 months) of supplying medical certificates on and off for his back condition. The medical certificate states that it is a temporary exacerbation of a permanent condition and that his symptoms include generalised lower back pain, referred pain to his legs, and an inability to sit or stand for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Joe gets up and down from his chair to stretch and change positions regularly throughout the assessment. Treatment is indicated to be non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physiotherapy and exercise. Joe is also a little overweight. The doctor indicates on the certificate that Joe cannot undertake his usual work or study, nor can he do more than 8 hours of work per week.</p>

<p>Joe tells the Assessor that he has had back problems since a fall at work 5 years ago, but in the last couple of years, it has become worse. He says that he could have surgery, but there is just as much chance it will do damage as there is it will improve, so he is not keen to pursue it. He says that even when he is not suffering a 'relapse' his back affects everything he does.</p>

<p>Joe's history of medical certificates along with his verbal history, his current medical evidence, presentation at interview, and his indication that the only treatment option may not be effective, means that it is likely his situation will affect his ability to work into the future and will in fact deteriorate.</p>

<p>Therefore, an upgrade to a JCA and the impact of his condition assessed against the impairment tables would be appropriate. In this case, where medical certificates are the only evidence, contact with Joe's doctor would be needed.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> before a claim for Disability Support Pension (DSP) can be granted, a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) will be required.</p>

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> An Assessor should upgrade an ESAt to a JCA wherever possible where the available evidence indicates that the customer meets medical qualification criteria for Disability Support Pension (DSP).</p>

<p>For an assessment to be upgraded to a JCA, the Assessor must determine, based on available evidence, that the job seeker meets the DSP medical qualification requirements, that is they&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
have verified, permanent medical condition(s) that are fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised (FDTS)</li>
		<li>
are assessed as having a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of at least 20 points</li>
		<li>
are unable to work or be retrained for work of at least 15 hours or more per week at or above the relevant minimum wage within the next 2 years because of their impairment, and</li>
		<li>
are assessed as either having a severe impairment or as having actively participated in a Program of Support (POS)</li>
		</ul>
<p>If a submitted ESAt report contains sufficient evidence to assess the job seeker as meeting all medical eligibility criteria for DSP and the assessment was not upgraded, the Service Officer should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
review the report to identify the reason the Assessor did not upgrade the assessment</li>
		<li>
contact the Assessor to discuss the reason the assessment was not upgraded</li>
		<li>
accept or return the report as necessary</li>
		</ul>

<div class="showcont">


<p><strong>Answer&#58; </strong>After an upgraded ESAt has been submitted, the report is reviewed and accepted following normal procedures. Once the report is accepted, the customer must be invited to claim Disability Support Pension (DSP). The Service Officer should&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
review the customer record to ensure they meet other non-medical DSP eligibility (for example income and assets, residence etc.)</li>
		<li>
run the DSP Invite to Claim guided procedure</li>
		<li>
contact the job seeker, invite them to claim DSP and advise them that they will need to attend a Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) (unless they are manifestly eligible)</li>
		<li>
attach the 'invite to claim' sticker to the front of the DSP claim pack</li>
		<li>
send the job seeker the claim form with the Q055 letter which was generated from the script and printed locally</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Contact must be made with the Assessor before returning a report. If contact by phone is unsuccessful, the Service Officer should send an email, copied to the Assessor's Team Manager/Team Leader. The Assessor has 2 days to reply to the email, however if no contact is made then the Service Officer may return the report</p>

<p>When the report is returned, the Service Officer should email the Assessor and their Team Leader to advise the report has been returned and the reasons why the report has been returned.</p>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Since 1 July 2011, original medical evidence must be referenced in an ESAt report to support all verified conditions within the report. Previous assessments can no longer be used to verify a condition. If medical evidence is not referenced and viewable in Document Tools/eMife, the report should be returned to the Assessor.</p>
		<ul>		<li>
All verified conditions (temporary and permanent) must be referenced within the ESAt report</li>
		<li>
For ESAt upgrades to JCA, all medical conditions recorded must be linked to 1 or more sources of original medical evidence to confirm the diagnosis</li>		</ul>

<p><strong>Answer&#58;</strong> Original medical evidence refers to a medical report, medical certificate or other medical evidence such as a specialist report. This medical evidence must be a viewable document which has been scanned to the job seeker record and cannot be an earlier ESAt or report or other document that refers to the original evidence. Assessors must reference the medical evidence used for the previous report or document, not the report or document itself.</p>
