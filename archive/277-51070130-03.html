If the payer is in an excluded jurisdiction and no court order exists, an application for an Australian child support assessment or a child support agreement will be deemed ineligible</li>
		<li>
For FTB maintenance action test purposes it is not considered reasonable for the customer to take maintenance action where the payer is in either an excluded or non-reciprocal jurisdiction. It is not reasonable for the customer to take maintenance action, as Child Support is not able to enforce collection of a child support assessment, agreement or court order. In these cases, the customer should be granted a MAT exemption. A referral to Legal Aid is not required unless the customer wishes to take action through the courts and apply for child support</li>
		<li>
If proof of parentage does not exist and the alleged payer is in a <strong>non-reciprocating country</strong>, it is considered unreasonable to force the customer to continue to pursue child support. This is due to the expense and length of time involved and also because an application for an Australian child support assessment or agreement will be deemed ineligible. A parentage unknown Social Work referral is not required in these cases, the customer should be granted an OSN MAT exemption</li>
		<li>
Advise the customer in writing if the paying parent's place of residence changes, they need to contact family assistance and may be required to take maintenance action.

<p><strong>In all other cases</strong>&#58;</p>

<p>If the customer is not collecting 100% of an overseas court ordered maintenance amount, they can apply to Child Support to register their overseas court order, seek an overseas court order or apply for an Australian child support assessment.</p>

<p>For overseas court orders made in reciprocating jurisdictions, the customer can make an application to Child Support for registration and collection of their court ordered maintenance. Child Support are not able to register court orders made in non-reciprocating jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Where the customer is seeking an overseas court order, update the MAT code to '<strong>OSS</strong>' (Payer overseas in a reciprocal country, customer seeking court order). This should be manually recorded from date court order is sought.</p>

<p>A MFU (keywords&#58; OSS MAI) will be generated after 1 year and 13 days (378 days). '<strong>NMA</strong>' (no maintenance action) should be coded as of the date the MFU is produced. This will limit the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A rate for the child to base rate. If the customer provides proof that court action is ongoing, refer details to the Families and Child Care Level 2 Policy Help Desk via the online enquiry form. </p>

<p>The <a>Resources</a> Page contains a link to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk online referral form. The online enquiry form <strong>must</strong> be lodged. Wait until referral outcome is complete before advising the customer of the decision.</p>

<p>If the payer is not resident in Australia and there is not enough information available to determine the whereabouts of the payer, Child Support cannot accept an application for child support.

<p>There is no guarantee child support can be collected, and long delays are possible. When Child Support refer a case to an overseas authority, collection is reliant on the ability of the overseas authority to collect and transfer child support as per the rules and legislation of the overseas authority. If child support is received from an overseas authority, Child Support will transfer that money to the payee. It may be months before any child support is collected. In the meantime, Child Support will advise Centrelink of the payee's entitlement.</p>

<p>Child Support has 90 days in which to register the maintenance liability for these customers, therefore a minimum of 90 days is to be allowed before reviewing maintenance action in progress. The <strong>PRP</strong> code allows 99 days, which is a sufficient timeframe for the application to be processed by Child Support.</p>

<p>Record details on a <strong>DOC</strong>. Include the name of the child, the payer and the date. The <strong>DOC</strong> must clearly state that the <strong>PRP</strong> code has been used as a manual workaround because the payer is overseas in a reciprocating country and Child Support has 90 days to register the case (rather than the usual 28 days).</p>

<p>If the customer advises the payer has <strong>entered a reciprocal jurisdiction or commenced residing in Australia)</strong>, a '<strong>DMA</strong>' period needs to be manually triggered in order to restart the MAT. The <a>Resources</a> page contains an example where this would apply.</p>

<p>Confirm with the customer when they became aware of the payer's change of residency.</p>

<p>The date the customer (payee) became aware of the payer's change in residency may differ from the actual date the payer entered Australia or a reciprocal jurisdiction. In these cases, the customer should be given a DMA period (13 weeks or 91 days) from the date they became aware of the payer's change of residency.</p>

<p>This acknowledges that the customer had maintenance action test requirements from the date they became aware the payer had returned to Australia/moved to a reciprocating jurisdiction. If the customer advises of the change of residency more than 91 days after they became aware, the customer may incur an FTB debt due to retrospectively failing the MAT. If policy advice is needed, refer the case to the Families and Childcare Level 2 Policy Helpdesk via an online form.</p>

<p>Once the commencement date of the grace period is determined&#58;</p>

<p>Service Support Officers (SSO) should refer the case details to the National ICT Referral Officers (NIRO) via existing NIRO referral protocols.
