<p><strong>Child is a foster child of the customer</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fees are paid by the foster carer</strong></p>

<p>Georgia is a foster carer and claims CCB and Child Care Rebate (CCR) for foster child Max. Georgina's gap fee (after CCB and CCR is applied) is $200. Georgia pays $200 and the child care service issues accounts/receipts in Georgia's name. The NSW Department of Community Services (DoCS) then reimburses Georgia for the $200. Georgia is deemed liable for the child care fees, as the child care service has issued the accounts/receipts in Georgia's name. This makes Georgia liable for the fees and as a result, the reimbursement of the gap fee by DoCS does not change that liability.</p>

<p><strong>Fees are paid by DoCS</strong></p>

<p>If DoCS paid <strong>all</strong> of the child care fees ($300), Georgia would not be deemed liable for the child care fees and would be unable to claim CCB and CCR. The child care service will issue the receipts in DoCS name.</p>

<p><strong>Fees are paid by both DoCS and foster carer</strong></p>

<p>Fees are $50 per day. Georgia pays $100 (2 days) and DoCS pays $100 (2 days), Georgia would only be deemed liable for the child care fees for the 2 days ($100) paid and would be eligible for CCB/CCR for those 2 days. The child care service will issue 2 receipts, 1 tor Georgia for $100 for 2 days and 1 to DoCS for $100 for 2 days. The child care service will only submit the attendance for the 2 days Georgia is liable for.</p></td>

<p><strong>Child's carer resides in the same household (CCB registered care)</strong></p>

<p>Mary claims CCB for a child who attends registered care. Jack, who is the child's grandparent, is the registered carer who both lives and provides care in the same household that Mary and the child reside. Some hours of care are provided whilst Mary is present in the household.</p>

<p>As Jack is registered as an RCP, care provided to the child, regardless of whether it is in the same household that both reside, is considered acceptable care. It is also irrelevant that some care is provided for hours whilst Mary is present in the household, as this care is deemed acceptable for the purposes of claiming CCB registered care.</p></td>

<p>Jeremy and Tiffany have 2 children, Sophie and Thomas. Sophie attends Long Day Care 3 days per week, and Thomas attends After School Care 2 days per week of the same week.</p>

<p>Where more than 1 child in a family attends approved child care in the same week, this family will get the full effect of the multiple child percentage.</p>

<p>For families to get the full effect of the multiple child percentage, only 1 member of a couple should claim CCB. One member of a couple (either the customer or their current partner) can claim CCB for any children that each attend approved child care in the same week.</p></td>

<p><strong>Customer is salary sacrificing child care fees</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Mary has entered into a salary sacrificing agreement with the employer. Mary claims CCB for child James. The child care fees are paid via salary and Mary is unsure of the liability for the fees. Mary needs to check with the employer about who is liable for the fees. The liability will be based on how the employer has set up the arrangement with Mary.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Sara has entered into a salary sacrificing agreement with the employer to partially pay child care fees. Sara is liable for the child care fees that are not covered by the salary sacrificing agreement. Sara claims CCB for child Sally due to receiving CCB (and Child Care Rebate (CCR)) for the portion of child care fees paid for.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Brad entered into a salary sacrificing agreement with his employer. Brad claims CCB for child Michael. The child care fees are paid by his employer in full and Brad is therefore not charged for child care used at his centre. Brad is not eligible for CCB (and CCR) due to not being liable for the child care fees.</p></td>

<p>Rachel is <strong>not eligible</strong> to receive CCB for any biological children for attendance at ABC FDC on Tuesdays and Thursdays due to working on these days as a FDC educator.</p>

<p>Gillian has two school age children attending ABC FDC. One child is aged 11 and attends primary school, whilst the second child is 15 and attends secondary school (no exceptional circumstances exist).</p>

<p>Gillian is only eligible to receive CCB for the youngest child and NOT for the eldest child who is over 14 years of age and attending secondary school.</p>

<p>CCB for the oldest child should remain current provided all other eligibility criteria under the Family Assistance legislation is met. To ensure the FDC service/educator is complying with this regulation they are not to submit attendance for any care provided to Gillian’s oldest child. If the Service Officer has identified that attendance is being submitted for this child a tip off should be recorded.</p></td>

<p><strong>FDC and transport</strong></p>

<p>Matthew uses a FDC for child Sofia 3 days a week Monday, Thursday and Friday, outside of school hours, in the morning and afternoon.</p>

<p>On those three days, Matthew drops Sofia off at the FDC on the way to work at 8.30am and the FDC educator drives Sofia to school almost as soon as she arrives. Matthew then picks Sofia up at 6 pm each evening.</p>

<p>Matthew <strong>will not</strong> be eligible for CCB for the morning sessions of care as this is predominantly transport. Matthew will, however be eligible to receive CCB for the afternoon session, as the FDC provider cares for Sofia from the time school finishes until Matthew picks Sophia up at 6pm (the care provided in the afternoon session not being predominantly transport). To ensure the FDC provider is complying with this regulation they are not to submit attendance for any care provided to Sofia for the morning session. If the Service Officer has identified that attendance is being submitted for this session of care a tip off should be recorded.</p></td>
