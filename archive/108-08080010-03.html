<p>The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) closed to new entrants in 2014. Grandfathering arrangements are in place for existing customers, however the scheme will completely end in mid-2026. Customers renting their principal home under NRAS may be entitled to RA.</p>

<p>Rent paid to occupy a home built under NRAS is not considered as 'government rent'. NRAS dwellings are owned and managed by financial institutions, non-profit organisations and local councils. They are rented to eligible individuals and families at 20 per cent below the market rate.</p>

<p>In 2017-2018, a number of state housing authorities began to transfer the tenancy management of properties to community housing organisation providers, and customers may be eligible for RA.</p>

<p>Transitional housing is short-term housing for people who are homeless or are at risk of homelessness. Some transitional housing is managed by not for profit organisations including community housing providers. There is also some government agency involvement.</p>

<p>RA may be payable depending on the type of organisation that is providing the housing.</p>

<p>If the rent is&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
collected by the community housing organisation but then passed on to the state housing authority. The customer is paying government rent and not eligible for RA</li>

collected and retained by the community housing organisation to be used by the organisation. The customer would be a community housing tenant and eligible for RA</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers will need provide a copy of their agreement or a letter from the organisation. This will show which organisation is benefiting from the rent so that RA eligibility can be determined.</p>

<p>Customers who rent their accommodation from community housing or disability housing organisation (community housing organisation) are <strong>not</strong> considered to be government tenants or sub-tenants.</p>

<p>These community housing organisations may receive state funding or lease houses from the state housing authorities, but this does not mean the customer is a government tenant or sub-tenant for RA purposes. For example, some customers pay rent amounts to the New South Wales Aboriginal Housing Office (AHO). Payments made to the AHO are not government rent for the purposes of assessing eligibility for RA.</p>

<p>Customers who rent in disability housing may have a written agreement such as a lease but may still be considered to be living in exempt accommodation. If they are living in exempt accommodation they do not need to provide verification.</p>
