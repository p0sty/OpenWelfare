<p>Promote the use of self-service to report and update employment income paid and assist eligible customers to register and navigate the tools. See <a href="../self-service/133-19061415-01.html">Accessing and using Centrelink self service</a>.</p>

<p>Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self-service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an Exception applies.</p>

<p>If there has been a self-service failure, resolve the issue wherever possible and encourage customers to reconnect to their desired self-service channel. See <a href="../compliance-and-reviews/110-17102300-01.html">Reporting employment income self-service troubleshooting</a>.</p>

<p>Customers can update their employment income details online using the <strong>Report employment income</strong> service. This is done through their Centrelink online account or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.</p>

<p>Youth Allowance (student), Austudy, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Age Pension, Carer Payment (CP), Disability Support Pension and Parenting Payment (PP) customers without mutual obligations or participation requirements who commence employment, can report their, or their partner's, paid employment income through the Report Employment Income service via their online account. The customer will be automatically placed on statement reporting and can continue reporting their or their partner's employment income through service channels.</p>

<p>For information about options available to customers through online channels, see <a href="../self-service/133-04180000-01.html">Reporting employment income online</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> when a DSP customer uses the <strong>Report Employment Income</strong> service and records more than 30 hours in a week the update will not be successful. The customer will be advised to contact Services Australia and a work item will be created. Staff should <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03100010-01.html">complete the update and advise the customers of their options</a>.</p>

<p>From 7 December 2020, customers report the gross employment income they are paid in an entitlement period as shown on their payslip. Customers do not need to manually work out the amount of income earned by themselves and/or their partner. See the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-05.html">Resources</a> page for further information about the Changing the Income Assessment Model transition period.</p>

<p><a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010000-01.html">Employment income</a> is assessed from the Entitlement Period Start Date (EPSD) of the entitlement period in which it is paid. The income will be assessed from the EPSD for the same number of days as the employment pay period it relates to. If the payment was for a period equal to or less than the length of the entitlement period, the income will be spread evenly across the entitlement period. Income from payment periods greater than the length of the entitlement period are assessed across multiple entitlement periods. See the <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-05.html">Resources</a> page for examples of how income is assessed.</p>

<p>Employment income may be subject to <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07020000-01.html">Working Credit</a>, <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010130-01.html">Work Bonus</a> or <a href="../students-and-trainees/010-08010000-01.html">Income Bank</a> rules and Income Test rules each day of the entitlement period, regardless of the days worked. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> if a new pension claim is rejecting income or paying the incorrect rate under the income test, and there is employment income coded, check the Factors Affecting Rate (<strong>PFAR</strong>) screen for the assessment of the income.</p>

<p><strong>Employment income report by the employer via Single Touch Payroll (STP)</strong></p>

<p>Australian employers reporting payroll data to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) via Single Touch Payroll (STP) enabled software, can report employment income, leave and redundancy payments and employment cessation details. Services Australia can access this data for <a target="_blank" href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-20111656-01.html">mutual clients</a>.</p>

<p>Customers reporting via self-service channels (Centrelink phone self-service, Centrelink online account, or Centrelink Express Plus mobile app) are required to check, confirm or change any pre-filled STP data.</p>

<p>Staff may be presented with pre-filled STP data when assisting customers to report employment income using the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct. Staff must discuss the pre-filled details with the customer and make any changes as advised by the customer, where it doesn't match their payslip. It is the customer’s responsibility to check, confirm or change the employer reported data.</p>

<p>Once STP employment income is accepted by the customer, the confirmed data is automatically loaded onto the appropriate screens on the customer's record.</p>

<p>Further information regarding the pre-fill of employment details is located in <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-22070738-01.html">Single Touch Payroll</a>.</p>

<p>Customers with <a target="_blank" href="../job-seekers/001-09020000-01.html">mutual obligation requirements</a>, customers receiving Mobility Allowance (MOB) and/or a payment which has restrictions on the number of hours worked, such as Disability Support Pension (DSP) are required to report hours they have worked in their reporting period. Hours can be coded with a continuous income frequency or coded separately with the Hours for One period (HOP) frequency.</p>

<p>Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers are able to work indefinitely for less than 30 hours per week without losing eligibility for their DSP, subject to the income test. If a DSP customer advises they are working more than 30 hours per week, see <a target="_blank" href="../people-with-disability/008-03100010-01.html">Commencing or returning to work or self-employment Disability Support Pension (DSP)</a>.</p>

<p>Customers in receipt of Youth Disability Supplement (YDS) as part of their income support payments are only required to report the hours worked if they exceed 30 hours per week. The customer’s capacity to work may need to be reviewed as result of working 30 hours or more, as they may no longer have a partial capacity to work (PCW). See <a href="../people-with-disability/008-03070030-01.html">Youth Disability Supplement (YDS)</a>.</p>

<p>Customers receiving Carer Payment (CP) are required to have the hours worked in their reporting period coded on the <strong>CPAS/CPAD</strong> screens. See <a target="_blank" href="../specialist-manuals-and-system-tools/111-21050030-03.html">Carer Payment (CP) processing in the Earnings and reporting workflow tool</a>.</p>

<p>For Australian apprentice customers (YA, Austudy or ABSTUDY) who are reporting apprentice employment income, hours are required to be recorded so that the Employment Status FTO can be recorded.</p>

<p>Leave payments paid while temporarily absent from work are employment income; record it in the entitlement period in which it was paid. The number of hours ‘worked’ is equivalent to the number of hours for which the leave was paid, for the relevant entitlement period, coded with a HOP frequency.</p>

<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> customers who are required to report hours worked in the entitlement period are responsible for providing this information. Details of hours worked are not included in STP data.</p>

	<div class="collapsible_container">
		<div class="block">

<p>From 7 December 2020, employment income is coded on the Employment Income Paid Details (<strong>EAPP</strong>) screen with the appropriate frequency (for example&#58; IOP, LOP, MTE).</p>

<p>Employment income coded with a frequency other than MTE will be attributed from the EPSD of the entitlement period in which it was paid, for a length of time determined by the period for which the employment income was paid.</p>

<p>The Employment Income Details (<strong>EAN</strong>) screen will then show the attribution of the income recorded on <strong>EAPP</strong>. These attributed amounts are readily identified with a channel of '<strong>CAL</strong>' to indicate the data is calculated. A Pay ID is also assigned.</p>

<p>If the Pension Monthly Exception Rule is met and ongoing income is recorded using the MTE frequency, attribution of this income is as follows&#58;</p>

<p>MTE amount recorded is multiplied by 12 and divided by 364 to get a daily amount. This daily amount will be applied to each day from the Date of Event (DOV) onwards until a change is coded.</p>

<p>Ongoing assessment of employment income recorded with an MTE frequency commences from the date the income is paid, not the first day of the entitlement period in which the amount is paid. If the DOV is part way through an entitlement period, the income for that period is determined only for the days from the DOV to EPED, this income is then attributed across the whole entitlement period evenly. See <a href="../income-assests-and-rates-of-payment/108-07010010-05.html#bp05_tbl_Calculating_inc_7">Resources</a> for an example.</p>

<p>A customer may be paid an amount of employment income that is not for a particular period, for example, a performance bonus. Ask the customer questions to determine if the payment relates to a specific period. For example, was the payment in return for work or a service provided? If so, what period was this work or service performed over? It may be appropriate to request a copy of a payslip giving details about the payment, if available.</p>

<p>If the set pay period cannot be determined based on the details provided&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the amount is assessed over a period of up to 52 weeks, and</li>

<p>If, after discussion with the customer and Local Peer Support (LPS), a pay period cannot be determined, refer the case to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for investigation. In the referral, ensure information is provided about the questions asked and the answers given by the customer. Scan any available documents, such as payslips, to the customer’s record. Document the customer’ record to indicate that the case has been referred for follow up.</p>
