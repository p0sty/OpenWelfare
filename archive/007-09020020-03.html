from the child’s date of birth, the primary claimant is not required to have primary care of the child from the transfer date and may have returned to work after primary care was transferred</li>

<p>Primary claimants can give permission for another person to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days. </p>

<p>The secondary claimant must claim PPL&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
before the child’s first birthday or anniversary of adoption, if they are also claiming some or all of the PPL period. However there are time limits for claiming the maximum PPL period</li>
		<li>
before the child’s first birthday or anniversary of adoption, if they are claiming Flexible PPL only</li>
		</ul>
<p>Customers should be encouraged to claim as soon as possible as delaying may result in&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
missing out on their full entitlement, or </li>
		<li>
having less choice around when they can claim Flexible PPL days</li>
		</ul>
<p>The secondary claimant will be asked&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
how many Flexible PPL days they have been granted permission to claim, and </li>
		<li>
to choose dates for some or all of these days</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once the claim is processed and the records are linked, this will be checked against the actual number of days the primary claimant has given permission for.</p>

<p><strong>The secondary claimant will tell Services Australia the dates they want to claim their Flexible PPL days</strong>. They do this&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
in their initial claim for PPL or </li>
		<li>
at a later time <img src="../resources/images/icon-ss-phone-32px.png" alt="" title="A self service option is available" /> online, by phone, or in person</li>
		</ul>
<p>They must do this before of the child’s second birthday or anniversary of adoption. However the secondary claimant must be advised that&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
any Flexible PPL days that they do not claim will remain in the unclaimed balance for the child until a date is claimed</li>
		<li>
unclaimed days can be claimed by any secondary claimant that is linked to the child or permission can be removed by the primary claimant</li>
		</ul>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> the online service to manage Flexible PPL days is not available for a secondary claimant until the claim status is ASSessed or CURrent.</p>

		<li>
if this claimant is an eligible primary claimant themselves under exceptional circumstances</li>

meet the <a href="../families/007-05020030-01.html">PPL work test</a></li>

meet the PPL income test</li>

<p>Additionally, to be eligible for&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
the PPL period, the secondary claimant must not have worked since becoming the primary carer of the child</li>
		<li>
Flexible PPL days, for a child born or adopted on or after 1 July 2020, the secondary claimant must not be working on the day they want to claim Flexible PPL</li>

<p>To be eligible, the secondary claimant must be the primary carer of the PPL child and have become the primary carer on the day after the primary claimant ceased to be the primary carer, <strong>unless&#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>		<li>
<strong>they become temporarily unable to care for the child</strong> due to circumstances beyond their control and the period is expected to be less than 26 weeks</li>

<p>There have not been any changes to the PPL rules regarding return to work for bereavement cases. A bereavement customer can return to work and continue to receive PPL, but it is the customer’s responsibility to advise their employer when their PPL period starts and ends, so the employer is aware of impacts to JobKeeper Payment.</p>

<p>The PPL period start date for a secondary claimant is determined by the primary claimant. Secondary claimants cannot nominate a start date for the PPL period.</p>

<p>The primary claimant must nominate the start date for the PPL period in their claim.</p>

<p><strong>Partial transfer</strong></p>

<p>If the primary claimant has or will transfer some of their PPL period, the secondary claimant's PPL period start date is the day after the primary claimant’s PPL period end date. There cannot be a break in the PPL period.</p>

<p><strong>Full transfer</strong></p>

<p>If the primary claimant is transferring all of their PPL period to the secondary claimant, the start date for the secondary claimant depends on the following factors&#58;</p>

<p>The primary claimant's nominated start date (NSD)&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If proof of birth and an effective PPL claim are provided by the primary claimant's NSD, the secondary claimant’s PPL start date will be the primary claimant’s NSD</li>
		<li>
If proof of birth and an effective PPL claim are provided after the primary claimant’s NSD but <strong>within</strong> 28 days of the birth/adoption/surrogacy, the secondary claimant’s PPL start date will be the primary claimant's NSD</li>
		<li>
If proof of birth and an effective PPL claim are provided after the NSD and <strong>more</strong> than 28 days after the birth/adoption/surrogacy, use the later of the dates (if different) the proof/claim was received/lodged as the primary claimant’s NSD. This date will also become the secondary claimant’s PPL start date</li>
		<li>
If the primary claimant has chosen an NSD in the future which is a later date than the proof of birth and/or claim is lodged, then the secondary claimant’s NSD is the future date</li>
		</ul>
<p>Date the child enters the secondary claimant's primary care&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
If this is on the date that would have been the primary claimant's start date, this date is the secondary claimant's start date</li>
		<li>
If this is after the date that would have been the primary claimant's NSD, the date the secondary claimant <strong>gains primary care</strong> is the secondary claimant's start date. For example, the primary claimant’s NSD is 15 July. Transfer of care to the secondary claimant is 25 July, therefore PPL can only commence from 25 July for the secondary claimant. This would reduce the PPL period for the secondary claimant by the time between the primary claimant's NSD and the date the secondary claimant gains primary care</li>
		</ul>
<p>When processing full transfer claims where a <strong>reduction of the secondary claimant's PPL period</strong> is likely due to the primary claimant’s NSD, the Service Officer must contact the primary claimant and suggest changing the nominated start date to avoid the PPL period reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Full Transfer of PPL period</strong></p>

<p>Either the primary or secondary claimant must be eligible for each day from the child’s date of birth or entry into care to the PPL period start date.</p>

<p>If the secondary claimant is not eligible for any day from when they gain primary care until the maximum PPL period end date, their PPL period will end on the day they cease to be eligible.</p>

<p>Primary claimants can give permission for another person to claim some or all of their Flexible PPL days. These days will then be available in the balance of unclaimed days for any secondary claimants linked to the child. </p>

<p>The secondary claimant must claim these days before the child’s second birthday or anniversary of adoption. <strong>Note&#58;</strong> PPL claims that include a full or partial transfer of the PPL period must be lodged before the child’s first birthday or anniversary of adoption. There are time limits for claiming the maximum PPL period. </p>

<p>The primary claimant can remove this permission at any time&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
during the pre-birth phase, or</li>
		<li>
before a secondary claimant has claimed the day</li>
		</ul>
<p>Once permission is removed, the day is returned to the primary claimant’s balance of unclaimed days. </p>

<p><strong>Secondary claimant has also been transferred some or all of the PPL period</strong></p>

<p>If the secondary claimant has also been transferred the full or partial PPL period, they can connect some or all of these Flexible PPL days to the PPL period. They must do this before the PPL period commences. </p>

<p>If the secondary claimant’s PPL period ends early, (such as due to returning to work or other <a href="../families/007-05040020-01.html">change in circumstances</a>) they can still claim Flexible PPL days after the end of the PPL period end date. If they have already claimed these days, they may be reassessed, based on the new PPL period end date.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple secondary claimants</strong></p>

<p>If there are multiple secondary claimants for a child (for example, the child’s other parent and partner of the birth mother), the primary claimant cannot split the number of days between them. The number of days that have been given permission will be available to claim by any of the secondary claimants. </p>

<p><strong>Eligibility for Flexible PPL on a day</strong></p>

<p>The eligibility requirements for primary and secondary claimants to get Flexible PPL on a day are the same. </p>
