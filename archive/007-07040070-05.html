<p>Change of care where the customer is fleeing a family and domestic violence situation</p></td>

<p>Muriel flees a family and domestic violence situation and presents at the local women's refuge with child Amelia. Muriel has recently fled from the ex-partner who was receiving FTB for Amelia.</p>

<p>Muriel lodges a claim for FTB for Amelia, supported by a letter from the women's refuge that Muriel is caring for Amelia at that point in time. Muriel is concerned that contacting the ex-partner to confirm the change of care may place them at risk of harm.</p>

<p>The Service Officer needs to be satisfied there has been a change in care and that Amelia is now in Muriel's care. The Service Officer may need to seek other forms of verification that the change of care has occurred. This may require social worker involvement or Muriel may be requested to provide additional evidence. The letter from the women's refuge can be used as part of the evidence to support the change of care.</p>

<p>Ultimately the Service Officer needs to be satisfied that a change of care has occurred based on available evidence, without confirming with the ex-partner.</p></td>

<p>Change of care - supported by an interim court order</p></td>
<td>

<p>On 20 December 2013, Byron requested FTB due to now caring for 2 children. Byron's ex-partner Phoebe was contacted to confirm the details. Phoebe contested that the children were now in Byron's full-time care and claimed that they were only on an access visit.</p>

<p>Byron was able to produce an interim court order dated 18 December 2013 which stated the children were to reside with Byron from 18 December 2013 until further orders were issued.</p>

<p>Phoebe stated the matter was due to go back to court in January 2014 and intends to fight to get the children back and explains this absence is only temporary.</p>

<p>However, as the change of care is fully supported by the interim order dated 18 December 2013, Byron can be paid from the date of the order (18 December 2013) and Phoebe's payments for the children must be cancelled from this date.</p></td>

<p>Moira is a single parent who has the full care of 2 children. The children go to stay with their grandparents during the Christmas school holidays for 6 weeks and the grandparents lodge a claim for FTB.</p>

<p>Moira contested the change stating the children were only away temporarily and shows financial assistance was provided to the grandparents to care for the children during their visit. Moira also provided the children with pocket money, clothes and toiletries, etc. Moira regularly phones the children during their holiday and is consulted regarding the children's medical needs and activities.</p>

<p>On the basis of the information provided, it is decided that the children remain in Moira's care during their holiday, and the grandparent's FTB claim is rejected.</p></td>

<p>An additional child claim for FTB is received from Rosemary on 10 August for child Yon. Rosemary claims care for Yon and states the child has now left the care of Margaret.</p>

<p>The Service Officer calls Margaret, who is currently receiving FTB for Yon. Margaret disagrees that Yon has already left and confirms Yon is only leaving Margaret's care on the following Saturday, 15 August.</p>

<p>Child Support then calls Rosemary who agrees with Margaret's statement explaining that a mistake was made when writing the dates. Rosemary accidentally wrote the date claimed as the date of the change in care.</p>

<p>On Margaret's record, Yon is recorded as left care from 15 August. This cancels Margaret's FTB for Yon. Rosemary's claim is then processed and Yon is recorded in Rosemary's care from 15 August. Child Support also records a <strong>DOC</strong> on each customer's record and includes details of the contact with each person.</p></td>

<p>Anne and John have 1 child, Kevin, and are separated. Kevin enters Anne's care from 2 September 2013. John is sent letters and has been called several times (to check if Kevin has in fact left John's care). John's FTB is cancelled DPT + 1 on 9 October 2013 after no reply contact.</p>

<p>Anne is asked to supply evidence to prove that Kevin has entered Anne's care. Anne supplies evidence of the change in care on 13 October 2013. As evidence has been provided, a care decision can be made.</p>

<p>John's record is updated that Kevin left care on 2 September 2013 and to ensure correct processing, John's FTB must be restored as part of this activity and a debt will be raised for the FTB paid from 2 September to 9 October.</p>

<p>Anne's FTB must be updated using 2 September 2013 as the date that Kevin entered care, resulting in an arrears payment.</p></td>

The letter outlines that Billy has been placed in Jane's care by the welfare agency/state authority under a foster care arrangement and advises the date this occurred. </p>

<p>The <strong>P24845</strong> system issue may impact in the following scenarios&#58;</p>
		<ul>		<li>
Where a step parent is claiming FTB that has been transferred to them from a biological parent, who is also a mutual Child Support Customer, and the other biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB for any level of care</li>
		<li>
Where the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and they later separate. Care details for the child will not be transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh is requested</li>
		<li>
The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child support assessments and impacting multiple parties</li>
		</ul>
<p>As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('<strong>TOP</strong>' is keyed on the Child Override/Claim (<strong>CHOC</strong>) screen - from parent to step parent) and the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these records are to be referred for investigation.
