|                                   | 1 - Late reporting/Late stim or   |
|                                   | change of EPED - The system       |
|                                   | expected a payment on the usual   |
|                                   | date i.e. 2 weeks after the last  |
|                                   | one. If the payment is reported   |
|                                   | late or the EPED has changed, it  |
|                                   | will often create a DOC saying    |
|                                   | the customer has been paid $0 on  |
|                                   | the due date and/or the customer  |
|                                   | has been paid a full payment on a |
|                                   | different date when $0 was due on |
|                                   | that different date.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 2 - Delivery of a one-off         |
|                                   | payment - The system is often     |
|                                   | confused by the delivery of a one |
|                                   | off payment, such as quarterly    |
|                                   | CES, carers supplement, or even   |
|                                   | Telephone Allowance. This will    |
|                                   | often lead to the creation of a   |
|                                   | DOC indicting a discrepancy equal |
|                                   | to this amount.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 3 - Weekly payments - Weekly      |
|                                   | payments will usually cause a DOC |
|                                   | to generate each week because the |
|                                   | system expects 1 full payment,    |
|                                   | not 2 half payments.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 4 - Part payment - If the         |
|                                   | customer is suspended or          |
|                                   | cancelled part way through an     |
|                                   | EPED, the system will often       |
|                                   | generate a DOC because it is      |
|                                   | expecting a full fortnightly      |
|                                   | payment, not the part payment     |
|                                   | that has been delivered.          |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | DOC as they are not on the usual  |
|                                   | time schedule.                    |

|                                   | being calculated can often cause  |
|                                   | a DOC to generate as the system   |
|                                   | is expecting a full payment.      |
