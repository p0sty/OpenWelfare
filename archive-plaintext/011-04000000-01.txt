This document outlines information and resources about My Health Record
system for individuals. A My Health Record is a secure electronic
summary of an individual's health information.

Government intent

The Government Intent for the My Health Record system is for individuals
to have a My Health Record. The individual controls what goes into it
and who is allowed to access their record. A My Health Record allows
doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers to view and share an
individual's health information to provide the individual with the best
possible care.

Benefits

My Health Record lets individuals control their health information
securely, in one place. This means important health information is
available when and where it’s needed, including in an emergency.

As more people use the My Health Record system, Australia’s national
health system will become better connected. The result is safer, faster
and more efficient care for people receiving health care in Australia.

The My Health Record system will give patients:

-   24/7 access to a summary of their health information, from anywhere
    in Australia
-   the ability to keep track of their medications, immunisations and
    allergies
-   more understanding of their health status, and more involvement in
    the healthcare decisions affecting them
-   the ability to share their important health information with all
    healthcare providers involved in their care

An individual can appoint someone else to manage their record if they
can’t manage it themselves (authorised representative), or want someone
else to be able to access the record (nominated representative).

Cost

Having a My Health Record is free.

However, if preparing and uploading a document to the My Health Record
system during a consultation takes time, the healthcare provider may
charge the individual for a longer consultation.

Getting a My Health Record

Anyone enrolling in Medicare has the opportunity to get themselves and
dependents under 14 years of age a My Health Record.

If an individual is not eligible for Medicare or Department of Veterans'
Affairs (DVA) benefits, they can still get a My Health Record and access
proof of their vaccinations and other key health information. The first
step would be to apply for an Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI).

Cancelling a record

Individuals who want to cancel a record can contact the My Health Record
System Operator to find out how.

If an individual wants to cancel a record due to separating from a
relationship, there are key tasks they should consider to keep their
personal information safe. See Separating safely - protecting personal
details 102-22060707.

Handling customer enquiries about the My Health Record

Services Australia handles enquiries that are about questions on forms.

Refer any Serious Privacy/Family and Domestic Violence concerns to
Digital Health Operations My Health Record Support Team.

The My Health Record system operator handles all other My Health Record
enquiries.

However, Service Officers can still help customers if they have
enquiries about incorrect demographic information (address or name
details), because the demographic information comes from Medicare
enrolment information.

Services Australia can also help customers at self-help terminals to
navigate to their My Health Record.

See the Triage a My Health Record enquiry table on the Process page.

The Resources page contains links to the My Health Record website and
contact details for the My Health System Operator.

A My Health Record can contain the following information:

-   Medicare information
-   clinical documents
-   an individual’s own notes

14-17 year olds

Parents/guardians cease to be able to act on behalf of their child/ren
when the child/ren turn 14.

This means parents/guardians cannot make a My Health Record opt-out
choice for child/ren, and they cannot access child/rens’ records.

14-17 year olds have the same capacity as an adult to make a My Health
Record opt-out choice.

The Process page includes information on how to determine if the enquiry
is My Health Record related, what to advise individuals and how to
redirect enquiries to the My Health Record System Operator.

The Resources page contains links to the My Health Record website for
information only. The My Health Record System Operator handles enquiries
about the My Health Record. Links to My Health Record contact details
and forms that include the My Health Record opt-out questions are also
available.
