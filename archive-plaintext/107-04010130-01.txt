This document outlines the process to follow when a recalled payment is
missing or if there is a payment discrepancy.

Recalled payment is missing or there is a payment discrepancy

The Request for Refund letter sent to the financial institution provides
2 options to return the funds:

Direct credit into:

-   BSB: 092002
-   Account No: 21951-6 (the Centrelink RBA GDES returns account)
-   refer to Treasury Helpdesk

Bank cheque - processed by the Debt Finance Team

Treasury's role

Treasury reconcile the Government Direct Entry Service (GDES) bank
account on a daily basis. This includes returning the payment/s to the
customer record. Returned payment appear on the Payment Summary (PS)
screen as RTN (Returned).

If the payment is not received, it may be because the payment:

-   has not been returned to Services Australia at all, or
-   was sent by the financial institution without enough details to
    match it to the correct customer record. For example, CRN, payment
    reference

Payment returns to the partner agency normally occur when the CRN is
incomplete or missing. The agency sends a trace request to the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) for further details. Returned payments appear on
a spreadsheet of 'outstanding' payments.

There is a daily sweep of the GDES returns bank account. This ensures
the account has a zero balance at close of business.

Treasury can allocate the funds to the correct customer record in most
cases once RBA provide the:

-   date
-   amount, and/or
-   revised CRN of the missing payment

It is more difficult to locate payments sent with an incorrect (someone
else's) CRN. Investigating these cases is not the role of Treasury.

It is not possible for Treasury to search every payment, on any given
day. There are about 600 to 1,000 returns processed to the RBA GDES bank
account daily. This volume of transactions (with minimal details
provided) is too large for Treasury to review. Searching for a specific
return is difficult because payment amounts are often common.

Payments are separated into payment types and environments. As exact
date and payment reference makes searching much easier. For example, a
full payment reference looks like this JR1S1357111222333C - (available
on the customer's record)

-   JR: Benefit type
-   S: Environment
-   1357: Payment number
-   CRN: 111222333C

Note: the first 3 components above make up the payment reference number.
This is on the right hand side of the screen when selecting (S) the
payment in the customer's record.

Debt Finance Team's role

Refer enquiries about payments returned by cheque to the Debt Finance
Team for follow up.

Confirm the cheque has been banked before referring to the Debt Finance
Team.

The Debt Finance Team do not hold cheques for more than 7 days, with
most being banked within 24 hours. Cheques can take longer to reach the
Debt Finance Team if not sent to Locked Bag 33. Allow 2 weeks from
posting of the cheque before sending 'missing cheque' enquiries to the
Debt Finance Team. The Debt Finance Team respond to any enquiry within 2
working days.
