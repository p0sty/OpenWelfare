|                                   | assist DSS by confirming if a job |
|                                   | seeker is receiving DSP, or meets |
|                                   | impairment criteria for DSP.      |

|                                   | assessment of their impairment    |
|                                   | rating, staff can refer them for  |
|                                   | a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA).  |
|                                   | Before making a JCA referral,     |
|                                   | staff must first determine        |
|                                   | whether the customer meets        |
|                                   | manifest eligibility criteria for |
|                                   | DSP. For example, if the customer |
|                                   | has an intellectual disability    |
|                                   | and shows medical evidence that   |

|                                   | than 70, Services Australia       |
|                                   | should be able to confirm to DSS  |
|                                   | that the customer meets           |
|                                   | impairment criteria for DSP       |
|                                   | without a JCA.                    |

|                                   | order to be assessed for SWS.     |
|                                   | Staff should make the customer    |
|                                   | aware that while receiving a      |
|                                   | supported wage they may be        |
|                                   | entitled to partial pension       |
|                                   | subject to the normal income and  |

|                                   | for a customer who does not wish  |
|                                   | to claim DSP, the JCA referral    |
|                                   | must be made using the 'SWS'      |
