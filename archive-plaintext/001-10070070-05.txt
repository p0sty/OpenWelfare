Letter text - Q062

The following text is to be used when creating the Q062 letter to send
to a job seeker who has a No Show, No Pay employment related failure
occurring on a weekend:

'After careful consideration about how you {did not attend a job
interview/did not conduct yourself appropriately at a job interview} on
{Incident Date}, a decision has been made that you do not have a
reasonable excuse for your actions.

This means that you have not met one or more of the conditions for
receiving your payment and a decision has been made that you have
incurred a No Show, No Pay failure.

This means a No Show, No Pay penalty will be deducted from your payment
made after {Date 14 days following the end of the instalment period
following notification*}. If the full amount cannot be recovered from
this payment, then deductions will be made from your future payments.

It is important that you continue to meet your mutual obligation
requirements.

If you don't meet your mutual obligation requirements you may incur
further No Show, No Pay penalties. You will lose your payment for a
longer period if you deliberately avoid your obligations.

This decision has been made under social security law.'

Note:

-   notification when delivered by letter is deemed to be 8 business
    days after the decision is recorded
-   include the Appeal paragraph in the letter
