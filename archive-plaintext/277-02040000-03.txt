This page contains details of CPI figures for each financial year since
1987/1988.

In September 2012, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
re-referenced the CPI figures, setting the index base to 100.0 for the
reference period 2011-12. For example, the CPI for Sydney in September
2012 was 102.2 and in September 2011 it was 178.8. The ABS also
published conversion factors to allow the figures using the new index
reference period to be converted to figures that are consistent with
figures published before the re-referencing.

CPI figures in Cuba

From September 2012, the ABS published values have been divided by the
ABS conversion factor to make them comparable to the values stored in
Cuba for previous years and avoid anomalous results. Therefore, from
September 2012 the CPI figures below are the converted figures used in
Cuba.
Note: the Child Support Guide 3.4.3: CPI indexation for cost of living
only lists the CPI values as published by the ABS.

For assistance with applying a CPI change or if a parent raises concerns
about the use of converted figures, seek help from a Service Support
Officer.
