| 1                                 | Review or re-reconciliation       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   I have recently reviewed your |
|                                   |     overpayment of Family Tax     |
|                                   |     Benefit (FTB) after receiving |
|                                   |     an update of your family      |
|                                   |     income for the 2000-01        |
|                                   |     Financial Year. Based on this |
|                                   |     information, the amount of    |
|                                   |     FTB or Child Care Benefit     |
|                                   |     (CCB) that you received was   |
|                                   |     more than you were entitled.  |
|                                   |     The result is an overpayment  |
|                                   |     of $xxx.xx or                 |
|                                   | -   Following reconciliation of   |
|                                   |     your FTB for the 2000-01      |
|                                   |     financial year, your          |
|                                   |     entitlement has been          |
|                                   |     recalculated due to updated   |
|                                   |     information about your family |
|                                   |     income. As a result, the      |
|                                   |     amount of FTB or CCB that you |
|                                   |     received was more than you    |
|                                   |     were entitled. The result is  |
|                                   |     an overpayment of $xxx.xx     |

|                                   | decided that for the 2000-01      |
|                                   | financial year only, families do  |
|                                   | not have to repay the first       |
|                                   | $1,000 of some FTB overpayments   |
|                                   | related to incorrect estimates of |
|                                   | income or shared care or the      |
|                                   | first $1,000 of some CCB          |

|                                   | -   As the amount of your excess  |
|                                   |     payment is below the waiver   |
|                                   |     amount allowed, you do not    |
|                                   |     have to repay any money or    |
|                                   | -   The overpayment has been      |
|                                   |     reduced by the 2000-01        |

|                                   | -   I have decided that as your   |
|                                   |     repayment is less than $50    |
|                                   |     you do not have to repay any  |
