Approximate calculation

The legislation lays down strict figures for the period on income
support and the final decision must be correct, but in most cases the
outcome will be clear cut, one way or the other. Instead of calculating
the exact period, which may be time-consuming for each case, use this
method to make an approximation before deciding whether a more precise
count is required.

|                                   | week requirement by one day, they |
