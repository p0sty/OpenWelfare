This document outlines the procedures to follow when an individual who
is caring for a child, expecting a baby, or expecting a child to enter
their care first makes contact about claiming a payment.

Inviting an individual to claim

A person making contact about a payment should be invited to make a
claim for payment, even if their eligibility for that payment is in
doubt.

Payments for families

The following payments and benefits are available to eligible parents,
grandparents or guardians:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB) fortnightly instalments or a lump sum for
    the previous financial year
-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
-   Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). Note: DAP is not payable for children
    born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023. Fathers and partners will
    need to claim PPL
-   Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)
-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) payable at the end of the
    financial year. Note: SIFS is not payable to new claimants from 1
    July 2017, however existing recipients may be eligible if they meet
    the grandfathering provisions
-   Double Orphan Pension (DOP) for a DOP child
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) scheme payments (for an
    eligible student)
-   Carer Payment (CP) and/or Carer Allowance (CA)
-   Parenting Payment (PP)
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP)

[] Online claims: these payments can be claimed online except AIC and
DOP.

Specific payment information

Links to information on specific payments are listed below.

A combined claim can be lodged for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Parental
Leave Pay (PPL). Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) for a child born or adopted
before 1 July 2023 must be claimed separately.

[] A single online claim can be submitted to claim any combination of
FTB, PPL and Child Care Subsidy (CCS). When claiming FTB for the current
year, FTB can also be claimed for the previous financial year.

An early claim can be lodged for PPL, FTB or DAP before a child's
expected date of birth or entrustment to care.

Claim choice for a newborn or adopted child: customers who are not
eligible for PPL but are eligible for FTB Part A will be automatically
assessed for the Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront Payment
(NBU) for a newborn or adopted child. There is no separate claim
required for NBS/NBU.

Customer contacts about claiming payments for families

[] Offer the customer the option of claiming online. Note: to claim
online, the customer must have an active Centrelink online account.

An Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) can be completed with the customer and
a verbal signature declaration accepted in the following situations:

-   families in crisis who are experiencing difficulty in understanding
    or complying with claim requirements, or who need a speedy outcome
    to meet immediate financial needs
-   remote Indigenous customers who have language or literacy barriers
    affecting their capacity to use forms or online claims (transfer the
    customer to Indigenous Services)
-   the customer is deemed unable or unsuitable to complete an online
    claim, or
-   a correspondence nominee is applying on behalf of their principal

Claimants who indicate they require an interpreter should not be
referred to claim online. Check Office Locator for preferred appointment
type and book an appointment with an interpreter at the customer's local
service centre. If unable to book due to language barriers, contact an
on demand telephone interpreter (Interpreter Connect) for assistance.

Record the conversation and booking of the appointment on the customer's
record. See Online or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) for family
assistance, Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)

For future contacts, Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD)
customers can use the Multilingual Phone Service (MPS) to conduct their
business with the agency.
