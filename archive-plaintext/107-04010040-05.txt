Amalgamation of debt

As all payments are amalgamated down to benefit/qualifier level, there
may be cases where 2 or more payment types are combined into one debt in
DMIS. For example, Parenting Payment Single (PPS) or JobSeeker Payment
(JSP), predominately when inter benefit transfer debts.

The DMIS benefit type will be the payment or allowance comprising the
largest portion of the overpayment.

This does not apply for debts that:

-   include Jobseeker Payment (JSP) and another payment type, and
-   have a debt start date before 20 March 2020

In these cases, do not use JSP as the DMIS benefit type. The Component
Amount (OPCA) screen stores each benefit type in the debt at the
component level. This ensures that DMIS passes the correct details for
each debt to ESSentials.

Do not separate these debts and raise them individually, except where:

-   the system generates them separately, or
-   there is a Schoolkids Bonus component. Raise this as a Schoolkids
    Bonus debt, not as a component of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)

When a combined debt is determined, tell the customer of all the payment
types that have been overpaid for via the:

-   free text within the account payable section of the script, or
-   Account Payable (OPAOD) screen

Legally payable arrears

In the example below, the arrears have been determined as legally
payable, and will be used to offset the overpayment amount.

In this example, the information required for the manual Account Payable

-   the overpayment period = 27 February 2021 to 12 March 2021
-   the overpayment amount = $253.69
-   the amount paid for the overpayment period = $253.69
-   the amount entitled for the overpayment period = $0
-   the legally payable arrears period = 20 March 2021 to 9 April 2021
-   the legally payable arrears amount = $68.14
-   the recovery fee = $0.00
-   the outstanding (debt) amount = $185.55

System generated duplicate payment debt example

Scenario

Customer contacted Services Australia to advise they had not received
their payment for the period 9 to 22 March 2022. The payment was
reissued and subsequently delivered to the customer’s account on 25
March 2022, however the original payment was not returned by the
financial institution. This resulted in the customer receiving 2
payments for the same entitlement period. The system generates an
undetermined duplicate payment debt for the payment that was reissued to
the customer.

The customer received a second (reissued) payment to replace the payment
not initially received for the entitlement period 9 to 22 March 2022.
The event that led to the duplicate payment and the start and end date
of the debt, all occur on the same day of 25 March 2022, the date the
duplicate payment was delivered to the customer.

Coding this scenario on the Modify/Assess Debt (OPMA) screen would show
in the following fields as:

-   Date of Event (DOV): 25 March 2022 (date of the event that led to
    the debt)
-   Start Date: 25 March 2022 (date of the first incorrect payment – as
    per ADEX activity details)
-   End Date: 25 March 2022 (date of the last incorrect payment – as per
    ADEX activity details)
