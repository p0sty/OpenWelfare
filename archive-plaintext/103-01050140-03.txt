|                                   | customer can be contacted. This   |
|                                   | should happen immediately where   |

|                                   | relevant (for example, regular    |

|                                   | with the customer. If no action   |
|                                   | is taken to end the customer’s IM |
|                                   | expenses, they will continue to   |
