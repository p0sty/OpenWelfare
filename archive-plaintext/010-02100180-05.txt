+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Supervisor travel appropriate due |
|                                   | to change of flight               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nine secondary school students    |
|                                   | are travelling from their         |
|                                   | isolated community to their       |
|                                   | boarding school in the city. The  |
|                                   | only appropriate mode of          |
|                                   | transport is to take the journey  |
|                                   | in 2 legs. The first leg is by    |
|                                   | chartered light aircraft from     |
|                                   | home to a regional airport and    |
|                                   | the second leg from there to the  |
|                                   | city on a regular commercial      |
|                                   | flight. The only light aircraft   |
|                                   | that can use the local airstrip   |
|                                   | can carry no more than 4          |
|                                   | passengers.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   As the journey requires a     |
|                                   |     change of flight, supervision |
|                                   |     of the students would be      |
|                                   |     beneficial. Allowing one      |
|                                   |     supervisor per 6 students,    |
|                                   |     there would normally be 2     |
|                                   |     supervisors allowed for 9     |
|                                   |     students. In this case,       |
|                                   |     however, 3 supervisors would  |
|                                   |     be required as there will be  |
|                                   |     3 aircraft needed for the     |
|                                   |     initial leg of the journey    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The local community can provide 2 |
|                                   | supervisors and the school will   |
|                                   | provide one of their teachers to  |
|                                   | be the other one.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA will cover return travel  |
|                                   |     for the teacher to travel     |
|                                   |     from the school to the        |
|                                   |     community (to meet up with    |
|                                   |     the children) and back again. |
|                                   |     The 2 community supervisors   |
|                                   |     will have their return travel |
|                                   |     from the community to the     |
|                                   |     school authorised             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is not possible to do the      |
|                                   | return journey in one day.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Additional costs associated   |
|                                   |     with travel will be approved  |
|                                   |     (to cover the supervisors'    |
|                                   |     accommodation and meals)      |

|                                   | kilometres out of Katherine,      |
|                                   | there are 3 children aged between |
|                                   | 12 and 14 who undertake secondary |
|                                   | schooling via the Katherine       |
|                                   | School of the Air. The students   |
|                                   | receive ABSTUDY Schooling A       |
|                                   | entitlements. Twice a year the    |
|                                   | students are required to attend   |

|                                   | travel costs for this activity.   |
|                                   | Under the provisions of FAA, a    |
|                                   | charter flight is booked to       |

|                                   | Katherine. ABSTUDY has been asked |
|                                   | to approve FAA for a supervisor   |
|                                   | to accompany these young students |
|                                   | on the charter flight.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Given the age of the          |
|                                   |     students, it is desirable     |
|                                   |     that they be supervised on    |
|                                   |     the charter flight. FAA for a |

|                                   | School is a boarding school near  |
|                                   | Esperance in rural Western        |
|                                   | Australia (WA). At the end of     |
|                                   | each term, many of the boarding   |
|                                   | students are entitled to FAA for  |
|                                   | a flight from Esperance to Perth. |
|                                   | A supervisor would not normally   |
|                                   | be necessary on this flight, as   |
|                                   | the students are familiar with    |
|                                   | this journey. However, last term  |
|                                   | there were some problems with the |
|                                   | students' behaviour on the        |
|                                   | flight. For this reason, Wongutha |
|                                   | has requested that a supervisor   |
|                                   | from the school travel with the   |
|                                   | students.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Due to the students' recent   |
|                                   |     behavioural problems while    |
|                                   |     undertaking this travel, it   |
|                                   |     is desirable that a           |
|                                   |     supervisor accompany the      |
|                                   |     students on the flight from   |
|                                   |     Esperance to Perth. A return  |
|                                   |     journey for a supervisor is   |
|                                   |     approved                      |

|                                   | returned home to Aurukun for the  |
|                                   | vacation period. Jody has         |
|                                   | requested FAA to return to school |
|                                   | at the commencement of term 4.    |
|                                   | Jody has been attending Djarragun |
|                                   | College for the last 3 years and  |
|                                   | is familiar with the journey, so  |
|                                   | a supervisor would not normally   |
|                                   | be necessary. However, Jody has   |
|                                   | missed travel on 2 prior          |
|                                   | occasions this year without valid |
|                                   | reason.                           |

|                                   | -   Due to Jody's frequently      |
|                                   |     missed travel this year, a    |
|                                   |     supervisor is mandatory to    |
|                                   |     undertake further travel for  |
|                                   |     the remainder of the academic |
|                                   |     year. FAA would not be        |
|                                   |     authorised and booked in      |
|                                   |     advance until a supervisor is |
