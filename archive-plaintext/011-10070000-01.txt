This document outlines information and processes for proof of
vaccinations from the AIR.

Proof of vaccination

The AIR produces 4 types of proof of vaccinations:

-   Complete immunisation history statements
-   COVID-19 and influenza (flu) immunisation history statements
-   COVID-19 digital certificates
-   International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC)

Immunisation history statements

AIR immunisation history statements help people keep track of their or
their child’s vaccinations.

-   The complete immunisation history statement shows all vaccines
    recorded for an individual on the AIR, including COVID-19 and flu
    vaccines
-   The COVID-19 and influenza (flu) immunisation history statement only
    shows COVID-19 and influenza (flu) vaccines recorded for an
    individual on the AIR

Both immunisation history statements

can be accessed online through:

-   myGov using Medicare, the Individual Healthcare Identifier Service
    or My Health Record
-   the Express Plus Medicare mobile app

can be downloaded on mobile devices and saved to use offline from:

-   the Express Plus Medicare mobile app
-   myGov

The AIR produces ad hoc immunisation history statements when individuals
ask for them, and milestone statements when children complete their
childhood vaccinations.

Information on the immunisation history statements

Immunisation history statements for children under 10 show:

-   their name and date of birth
-   their current immunisation status, including an immunisation
    catch-up if they have one recorded
-   any vaccines they have recorded on the AIR, under the National
    Immunisation Program (NIP) age schedule and in the date order given
-   NIP immunisations they still need and their due dates
-   any notices

Immunisation history statements for children and individuals 10 to 19
show:

-   their name and date of birth
-   their current immunisation status, including an immunisation
    catch-up if they have one recorded
-   any vaccines recorded on the AIR, in the date order given
-   any NIP immunisations they still need and their due date
-   any notices

Immunisation history statements for individuals 20 and older show:

-   their name and date of birth
-   any vaccines recorded on the AIR in the date order given
-   any NIP schedule adult immunisations they are eligible for and the
    date they can have them
-   any notices

Note: customers may call to ask for a copy of their immunisation history
statement without the smallpox vaccine shown on it. The AIR helpdesk
issue these manually. Service Officers must contact AIR Local Peer
Support (LPS) for the request to be sent to the AIR helpdesk for action.

The Resources page has a table that describes the information on AIR
immunisation history statements.

Milestone immunisation history statements

These automatically issue to parents and guardians when their child has
all their required National Immunisation Program (NIP) childhood
schedule vaccines. If a child is linked to more than one Medicare card,
statements are issued to the contact person of each card.

A milestone immunisation history statement will not issue when the
mainframe record has:

-   a registration end-date in the past
-   a Return Mail indicator of Y
-   an Opt Out indicator of Y. See Amend individual registration on the
    Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)

COVID-19 digital certificates

These certificates show COVID-19 vaccines recorded on the AIR.

A digital certificate is available when an individual:

-   has had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine/s approved or
    recognised in Australia, or
-   they have a medical contraindication (exemption) recorded on the AIR
    for Moderna Spikevax (MODERN), Pfizer Comirnaty (COMIRN) and
    AstraZeneca Vaxzevria (COVAST)

The COVID-19 digital certificate shows all of a customer’s COVID-19
vaccinations, including any booster doses. All vaccines will show on the
complete immunisation history statement, and only COVID-19 and influenza
(flu) vaccines will show on the COVID-19 and influenza immunisation
history statement.

The COVID-19 digital certificate:

shows the individual's name and date of birth

shows all of a customer’s COVID-19 vaccinations, including any booster
doses

can be viewed through myGov using Medicare, the IHI service or My Health
Record

can be downloaded from:

-   myGov using a mobile device and added to Apple Wallet and Google
    Wallet for easy access
-   the Express Plus Medicare mobile app and saved to mobile devices or
    digital wallets to use offline

Note: each time a customer adds their digital certificate to their Apple
Wallet or Google Wallet, it will save a new version. They can save
multiple versions of their certificate in the wallet to keep a history
of their vaccination proof.

For more information about COVID-19 vaccines, see Coronavirus (COVID-19)
vaccines.

Missing information on COVID-19 vaccination records

It can take up to 10 days for new vaccinations to appear on a customer’s
immunisation history. If a customer asks about missing COVID-19
vaccination information, check if there are duplicate records on the
AIR.

Vaccinations may be recorded against separate identifiers for
non-Medicare customers.

-   A duplicate Supplementary Identification Number (SIN) record on the
    Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)
-   A SIN record and unmerged Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI)
    record on the AIR, or
-   An IHI record and an unmerged Medicare Personal Identification
    Number (PIN)

See Table 8 for processing steps.

Note: the following hubs are not contactable by phone. If staff need to
contact because a vaccine was given more than 10 days ago, staff must
follow the process in Table 8 for:

-   NT Hub
-   VIC Hub
-   ASPEN Hub
-   SONIC Hub
-   NSW Sydney Olympic Park Hub
-   WA Health Hubs

Note: vaccination hubs cannot print COVID-19 vaccination evidence for
customers.

-   visit a service centre and ask for a copy to be printed. See the
    Resources page for a link to Office Locator

Note: a Service Officer cannot cancel an immunisation history statement
requested through mainframe.

If a Service Officer has sent a customer’s information without their
consent, they must:

-   report it using the Privacy Incident Notification form
-   notify AIR Local Peer Support (LPS) for them to escalate to the AIR
    helpdesk

International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC)

See International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC).

Proof of vaccination for children and parents/guardians

Proof of vaccination for children under 14

Parents and guardians can get proof their child's vaccination if their
child is under 14.

Vaccination evidence for individuals 14 and over

Individuals 14 and over must get their own proof of vaccination.

Note: individuals 14 and over using a Medicare Online account can see
the names of children (such as siblings) under 14 on the same Medicare
card. Viewing a child’s information without permission is a breach of
privacy.

Before someone 14 or older can view vaccination information online they
must:

Declare that they are:

-   the person to whom this information relates, or
-   a parent who has parental responsibility for the child, or
-   a legal guardian who has parental responsibility for the child

Accept that they:

-   understand giving false or misleading information is a serious
    offence

Parent or guardian requests proof of vaccination for someone 14 or older

Without the individual’s consent, Service Officers and face-to-face
staff cannot give out this information. This includes requests to
provide proof of vaccination in person or by mail.

Someone 14 or older can give consent in person or over the phone for
their parent or guardian to access this information. However, their
consent is only valid for that request.

See Authentication and release of information for Australian
Immunisation Register (AIR).

Parents and guardians who are 14 or older

Parents and guardians who are 14 or older can get proof of vaccination
for children who are:

-   under 14 on their Medicare card, and
-   for whom they have parental or legal responsibility

Long names and only names

Immunisation history statements and COVID-19 digital certificates

Long names or only names may not display correctly on immunisation
history statements or COVID-19 digital certificates.

To display the name correctly:

-   customers can ask for their name to be changed in CDMS, or
-   Service Officers may amend the name on the CDMS record. See Change
    legal name on Medicare record

If a change of name does not correct the immunisation history statement
or digital certificate, a request for manual immunisation history
statement or COVID-19 digital certificate may be required.

Note: International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC) cannot be
used in Australia as proof of vaccinations, they are for international
travel only. Do not tell a customer to request an ICVC if their name
does not display correctly on their immunisation history statement or
digital certificate.

International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC)

See International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC) for details
about long names and only names in ICVCs.

Unable to access proof of vaccination

Individuals cannot access proof of their vaccinations through any
channel when they cannot be uniquely identified.

For example, someone on a different Medicare card than the one quoted or
with a record with different personal details. In these situations, they
should call the AIR to confirm their identity and update their details.

Customers affected by family and domestic violence

If a customer has safety concerns about accessing or displaying proof of
their COVID-19 vaccinations there are a few options to help.

The customer can:

-   contact a healthcare professional or attend a service centre to
    print their proof of vaccinations for them
-   call the Australian Immunisation Register, update their address
    details and ask for proof to be sent. This can take up to 14 days to
    arrive in the post
-   let Services Australia know if they have concerns about the security
    of their online accounts. They should change their passwords to
    prevent unauthorised access
-   add their COVID-19 digital certificate to a digital wallet. Both
    Apple Wallet and Google Wallet require a passcode to use. They can
    add extra security with Face ID, Touch ID or an unlock pattern
    depending on device used. These can be changed or updated via the
    settings in the app

See Family and domestic violence for more details including:

-   links to national and state family and domestic violence services,
    the intranet and Services Australia website
-   guides and scenarios for helping customers affected by family and
    domestic violence

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) referrals or customers overseas

[] Customers who are overseas can get proof of their vaccinations online
through:

-   myGov, or
-   the Express Plus Medicare mobile app if enrolled in Medicare

If this is not possible, they can request proof of vaccination by
calling the AIR international phone number and passing a security check.

Service Officers should help customers with online options before
actioning requests to email proof of vaccinations.

Service Officers can:

-   request an International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate (ICVC) and
    email it to the customer. See the Email an ICVC table
-   refer requests for immunisation history statements and COVID-19
    digital certificates to AIR Local Peer Support (LPS). AIR LPS will
    escalate the request to the AIR helpdesk. See Table 6 on the Process
    page

Emailing proof of vaccination for customers in Australia

Proof of vaccination will only be emailed to customers in Australia in
exceptional circumstances. This includes compelling, compassionate
reasons or customers affected by a natural disaster or emergency.

In the first instance Service Officers should ask customers to try to
get their proof by:

-   logging onto their Medicare online account through myGov or the
    Express Plus Medicare mobile app
-   signing into the IHI service or My Health Record through myGov
-   asking for one to be mailed. It can take up to 14 days for it to
    arrive
-   visiting a service centre. See Resources page for a link to Office
    Locator

The AIR helpdesk can consider requests to email immunisation history
statements or COVID-19 digital certificates for customers in Australia.
Service Officers and AIR Local Peer Support (LPS) must not email proof
of vaccination to a customer in Australia without the AIR helpdesk
approval.

For requests to email:

-   immunisation history statements or COVID-19 digital certificates,
    see Table 6 on the Process page
-   International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (ICVC), see the
    Email an ICVC table

Note:

-   Do not email proof of vaccinations to AIR LPS without seeking their
    approval first
-   Escalating a request will not receive an instant reply. The fastest
    and easiest way for customers to request proof is online through
    myGov or by attending a service centre
-   The AIR helpdesk may not approve all requests to email proof of
    vaccinations. It is determined case by case. Encourage customers to
    request proof online

Printing proof of vaccinations

Individuals can:

access a print-friendly version of their proof of vaccinations through
myGov in their:

-   Medicare online account
-   Express Plus Medicare mobile app
-   IHI service, or
-   My Health Record

ask for a printed immunisation history statement or COVID-19 digital
certificate from:

a vaccination provider, or

by contacting Services Australia

Note: proof of vaccinations that customers access online are the same as
hardcopies produced by Services Australia. Customers do not need to ask
for hardcopies if they can print copies themselves. Printed proof of
vaccinations can take 14 days to arrive in the mail.

Not all providers can print digital certificates. For example, providers
that report vaccinations to the AIR through their practice management
software can issue an immunisation history statement but can't issue a
digital certificate. Even if they can issue the certificate, providers
may choose not to. Some might help if the customer has an appointment or
they provided the vaccinations. Others can refuse as they may not have
the resources for these requests.

Address details on printed proof of vaccination

For proof of vaccinations that are requested through central printing
and the individual is:

-   under 14, the letter is addressed to the parent or guardian and
    followed by the child’s name. For example, PARENT/GUARDIAN OF JACK
    JONES
-   14 or older, the letter is addressed to the person and sent to the
    address recorded on their AIR registration

Notices on immunisation history statements

One or more notice/s appear at the bottom of immunisation history
statements under specific circumstances.

Immunisation medical exemptions

If a child or individual has an immunisation medical exemption recorded
on the AIR, it will appear on their immunisation history statement.

When there is a:

permanent medical exemption recorded, the notice says:

-   Medical contraindication to (antigen) recorded on (date)

temporary medical exemption recorded, the notice says:

-   Medical contraindication to (antigen) recorded on (date) to expire
    on (date)

natural immunity recorded, the notice says:

-   Natural immunity to (antigen) recorded on (date)

Immunisation Register (AIR).

School entry

The notice ‘This individual has received all vaccinations required by 5
years of age’ shows when a child has received all NIP childhood schedule
vaccines. This is to help parents and guardians enrol their children in
schools that require proof of immunisation.

The notice shows on an immunisation history statement when:

-   the child is under 14
-   they are fully immunised
-   they have completed the 4year-old NIP schedule

The notice will not show if the individual has an immunisation medical
exemption recorded on the AIR and therefore has not received all
required vaccines.

Vaccine shortage

This notice shows on immunisation history statements when the Department
of Health and Aged Care has certified in writing that the vaccine for
that vaccination is, or all of the vaccines for that vaccination are,
temporarily unavailable.

When there is:

an end date for the vaccine shortage, the notice says:

-   Vaccine shortage for <vaccine brand name> recorded on (date) to
    expire on (date)

not an end date, the notice says:

-   Vaccine shortage for <vaccine brand name> recorded on (date)

Vaccine trial

The vaccine trial notice appears on immunisation history statements if
the person is participating in an approved vaccine trial.

When there is:

an end date for the trial, the notice says:

-   Currently participating in a vaccine trial due to expire on (date)

not an end date, the notice says:

-   Currently participating in a vaccine trial which commenced in (date)

The Resources page has examples of how notices appear on immunisation
history statements.

The mainframe YCEN - Mail History Details screen shows a record of
immunisation history statements generated by the AIR system. The
information on this screen includes:

-   date the immunisation history statement was requested by a Service
    Officer
-   date the immunisation history statement was dispatched
-   type of mail sent, for example, a milestone statement
-   status, for example FAILED when evidence will not be produced

If a request has FAILED and the parent, guardian or individual cannot
access an immunisation history statement:

-   online, or
-   their vaccination provider,
-   AIR Service Officers should print a statement from the AIR Service
    Officer Portal page. Service Officers can contact AIR Local Peer
    Support (LPS) for help
