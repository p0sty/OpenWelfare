This document outlines how to update the Social Service Plan (SSP) in
Customer First for customers receiving the Status Resolution Support
Services (SRSS) payment.

Contents of the SSP

The SSP captures information about changes in customer circumstances
that affect their rate of SRSS payment.

Note: as the SRSS payment is paid entirely within Customer First, there
will be no payments listed on the Payment Summary (PS) screen in the
Income Security Integrated System (ISIS). A list of all payments issued
are on the Payment List screen, which can be accessed through Workspace.
Future payments are in the SSP.

There are different types of SSPs. SRSS customers will have a 'Special
Payments Fortnightly (SPT)' type of SSP.

Updating the SSP

Any updates relating to a change in a customer’s circumstances should be
finalised before accessing and approving the SSP. The SSP determines a
customer's payment based on the changes made.

Some SSPs automatically approve and some require manual approval.

Following any change in circumstances that affects the SRSS payment, the
SSP needs to be approved for the payment to be updated. If the SSP is
not approved the change will not be actioned in the system.

If the Service Officer does not have the delegation to approve their own
work as a 'proficient user', all SSPs must be submitted for approval.

Proficient users will generally be able to approve their own work except
when instructed to submit a portion of work for approval for quality
assurance purposes. Unapproved SSPs will allocate via WLM to SRSS
trained officers.

The Resources page has contact details for the SRSS Level 1 Helpdesk and
a mySupport link.
