This document outlines how to determine the correct end date for payment
of the away from home rate of ABSTUDY for a dependent student or
Australian Apprentice.

Change in circumstances

A student or apprentice who has a change in circumstances may no longer
be entitled to away from home rate. A Service Officer is required to
determine whether the change in circumstances warrants the cessation of
away from home rate, and if so, the appropriate date for it to cease.

The most common changes in circumstances that affect eligibility to away
from home rate are:

-   the student is moving or has moved back to the permanent home
-    the circumstances that made the student eligible for away from home
    rate have changed
-    a student discontinues or completes a course of study
-    a secondary non schooling, tertiary student or Australian
    Apprentice is temporarily returning to the parental home and not
    maintaining their residence at the study or Australian
    Apprenticeship location

The correct end date for payment of away from home rate is determined by
the activity the student is involved in.

Secondary school student end dates

The last date of eligibility for away from home rate for a secondary
school student is:

-   where the student completes the full term's study, the last formal
    day of the school term in which the student commenced study
-    where the student discontinues study during a term, the date the
    student discontinued, or
-    the date from which the student ceases to be approved for away from
    home entitlements

Tertiary or secondary non schooling level end dates

The last day of eligibility to the away from home rate for a tertiary or
secondary non-schooling level student is the earlier of:

-   the date the student returns on a permanent basis to live at the
    family home
-    the date the student discontinues in a course
-    the last day of study in a completed course, or
-    the date from which the student ceases to be approved for away from
    home entitlements

Australian Apprentice end dates

The last day of eligibility to the away from home rate for an Australian
Apprentice is the earlier of:

-   the date they return on a permanent basis to live at the family home
-    the date they discontinue their apprenticeship, or their
    Commonwealth registration number is suspended or cancelled, or
-    the date from which the student ceases to be approved for away from
    home entitlements

Student temporarily returning to the permanent home

A secondary student who returns to the permanent home on a temporary
basis during their course of study (such as a study vacation period) can
continue to receive the away from home rate for the period of the return
to the family home. It is not considered to be a permanent return if the
student intends to return to his/her course after a recognised holiday
period, or a temporary visit.

A secondary non-schooling or Tertiary student who returns to the
permanent home on a temporary basis during their course of study (such
as a study vacation period) must continue to maintain their residence at
the study location for the period of their temporary return to continue
to qualify for the away from home rate.

Australian Apprentice temporarily returning to the permanent home

An Australian Apprentice who returns to the permanent home for a holiday
but intends to return to their apprenticeship, must continue to maintain
their residence at the Australian Apprenticeship location to continue to
receive the away from home rate for the period of the return to the
family home.

Ceasing eligibility

If the circumstances warranting approval of away from home rate change,
such as the permanent home relocating to within reasonable travel time
of the institution or place of work, away from home rate will normally
cease from the change in circumstances. However, the exception would be
for a secondary school student where continuity of study provisions
exist.

Students who cease eligibility for the away from home rate, but continue
to study, may be eligible to access alternate ABSTUDY allowances.

Note: students returning home to study do not have to lodge a new
ABSTUDY claim but will need to provide any changes, such as new school
details for ABSTUDY assistance to continue.

Recipients of Residential Cost Option

If the student is in receipt of the Residential Cost Option (RCO) and
they are planning on accessing RCO again in the next available study
period, they are entitled to receive the away from home rate during
their temporary return home over the vacation period. Only those RCO
students who plan on accessing RCO again in the next available study
period are considered to be maintaining their term address.

Secondary school students applying for Youth Allowance (YA)

Secondary school students who complete their studies for the year and do
not intend to return to studies in the following year are entitled up
until the end of their term entitlement period, which is 31 December for
Term 4. Therefore, if the student applies for YA prior to the end of the
term entitlement period, their ABSTUDY must not be cancelled. The
ABSTUDY must continue to remain current until the end of the term
entitlement period, for example, 31 December, and then the YA can be
granted if eligible.

This is to ensure unnecessary overpayments are not created for Living
Allowance and/or Group 2 School Fee Allowance.

Secondary school boarders who discontinue study

A secondary school boarding student who discontinues study in a school
term before it is complete, ceases eligibility to away from home rate
from the date the student discontinues study.
