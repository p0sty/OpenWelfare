Reconciliation report reason codes

Reason Codes are used to explain a difference between the actual and
expected deductions when reconciling employer withholding payments.
Which Cuba code is used depends on whether the adjustment is an
increase, decrease or if the adjustment is made at the Summary or Detail
window.

The codes entered are reflected in the Payer Employer Withholding
Enquiry window but are not displayed in the Payer Account Summary,
Client Payments List window or on a payer statement.

Reason for variation codes - Actual greater than expected

ADDI (ADDIT) - Code can be used when:

-   a payer voluntarily chooses to increase the deducted amount
-   deductions are received which are greater than the expected amount,
    but without explanation for the increase
-   amounts received are greater than expected due to incorrect pay
    cycles which must be corrected
-   payer requested employer to deduct the extra amount

Note: before using this code, confirm the funds were deducted from the
correct payer as commonly, employers include monies for s72A request for
another payer with the expected amounts for linked payers.

-   ADV (ADVANCE) - Advance due to holidays or long service leave
-   LETN (LETNREC) - Deduction letters not received by employer
-   NEWD (NEWDED) - Employer deducting at new rate earlier than required
-   OLDD (OLDDED) - Employer deducting at old rate
-   RSDE (RSDEMP) - Payer resumed employment with previous employer
-   TERM (TERMPAY) - Deducted from Payer’s termination payment
-   SRND (System Rounded) - Payment is within $10 of the expected amount
    on a single payer employer
-   PREVPDAT (Previous Paydate) - Used when reconciling on the first pay
    date of the month, and Child Support are in receipt of funds for the
    first and previous months. AFPM will display which stands for
    previous month

Note: the code NOPO (NOPOST) - ERR to be reconciled prior to posting of
expected deduction amount is only applicable to ERRs reconciled prior to
February 2005.

Online account Business Services reason code

-   ERR (RECERR) - Error in reconciling

This code is used by the data transfer functionality for online accounts
when employers submit deductions without reason codes. The ESO must
review the reason why the actual deduction does not match the expected
deduction and update accordingly.

Note: do not use this code if an ESO.

Reason for variation codes - Actual less than expected

DIDN (DIDNOTD) - Employer did not deduct. Repetitive use of this code
may indicate:

-   incorrect pay cycles
-   the employer is unsure of their obligation to deduct
-   the employer may be choosing not to comply or could be deducting and
    not remitting funds

LETN (LETNREC) - Deduction letters not received by employer

SRND (System Rounded) - Payment is within $10 of the expected amount on
a single payer employer

LWP ( LWOP) - Payer on leave without pay

NEM (NOTEMP) - Payer has left employment

NEWD (NEWDED) - Employer deducting at new rate earlier than required

OLDD (OLDDED) - Employer deducting at old rate

PEA (PROTECT) - Payer earnings under protected earnings amount

RSDE (RSDEMP) - Payer resumed employment with previous employer

STRK (STRIKE) - Payer on strike during deduction period

CASL (Casual Employee) - Casual employee has not worked and not been
paid. If employee has been paid but there is an insufficient amount to
deduct from, the PEA code should be used

WRKC (Workers Compensation) - Employee is currently receiving workers
compensation payments. Where this is the case, the ESO must create a
General Follow Up intray and document in the notepad that the payer is
on workers compensation and to consider alternative collection action
with the relevant Workcover Authority. Route to the owning Service
Officer or team

ADDI (Additional deductions) - This code is used when:

-   a payer voluntarily chooses to increase the deducted amount
-   deductions are received which are greater than the expected amount,
    but without explanation for the increase
-   amounts received are greater than expected due to incorrect pay
    cycles which must be corrected

The following codes will be available if a payer is added to the
Reconciliation Report:

-   DUPL - Added payer is linked to another employer
-   FDED - First deduction received from employer - no pay date for
    payer
-   LDED - Last deduction received from employer - no pay date for payer
-   S72A - Employer deducted money according to s72A requirement

Reason code for Detail Level only:

-   ERR (RECERR) - Error in reconciling (CSAOnline use only)
-   DUPZ - Linked payer is added to another employers ERR

Codes automatically generated by Cuba, CSAOnline or used in relation to
Overseas Authority Organisations:

-   ADJUST - Cuba only
-   MULTIPLE - Cuba only
-   OTHER - Cuba only
-   PREVDED - Cuba only
-   CONV TO LESS - Overseas only
-   DEDN WAS LESS - Overseas only
-   LEFT O/S EMPLOY - Overseas only
-   DLTE: Only viewable on the Payer Employer Withholding Enquiry
    window, this status displays when the employer reconciliation report
    for the pay date has been deleted. This status does not update if
    the pay date is subsequently created. To identify if money was
    reconciled view the Actual Ded column, any amount greater than 0.00
    in this column indicates that the pay date was created after
    deletion and then reconciled. If 0.00 is displayed, an organisation
    follow up intray may be appropriate
