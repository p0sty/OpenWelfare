This document outlines information about what is required for a child
born from a surrogacy arrangement to be included on their parent's
Medicare card.

Surrogacy arrangements

Surrogacy is defined as an arrangement whereby a woman agrees to become
pregnant and to bear a child for another person or persons to whom she
will transfer guardianship and custodial rights at or shortly after
birth.

Where a surrogate arrangement is in place, it is necessary for the
intended parents to provide the following documents before the child can
be included in Medicare:

Medicare enrolment form (MS004) if not using online services

identification of the applicant (parent)

one document from the list below:

-   parentage order, or
-   birth certificate (intended parents listed as child’s parents)

Note: if the birth certificate or parentage order has not been the
finalised, Service Officers must escalate the application to Medicare
Eligibility Local Peer Support (LPS) for review before LPS escalate to
the Medicare Consumers Program Support team, who will assess the
application on a case by case basis.

The Medicare Consumers Program Support team manages enrolments where:

-   documentation provided with the enrolment does not meet standard
    requirements, and

-   surrogacy arrangements involve a child born in the Ukraine
