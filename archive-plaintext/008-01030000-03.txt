|                                   | Tinnitus is where the person      |
|                                   | hears a sound, a ringing, or a    |
|                                   | noise when no external noise is   |
|                                   | present. The noise can be         |
|                                   | intermittent or constant, mild or |
|                                   | severe and may vary from a low    |
|                                   | roar to a high-pitched sound.     |

|                                   | high frequency hearing loss that  |

|                                   | age. It can be complicated not    |
|                                   | only by a decrease of the nerve   |
|                                   | cells in the inner ear available  |

|                                   | be caused by the build-up of wax  |
|                                   | in the outer ear cancel, which    |
|                                   | can lead to a reduction in        |
|                                   | hearing acuity. Medical treatment |
|                                   | to remove the wax is usually all  |
|                                   | that is required. Middle ear      |
|                                   | infections can lead to permanent  |
|                                   | damage if not treated. These are  |
|                                   | common in young children. Chronic |
|                                   | ear infection may result in ‘glue |

|                                   | of the tiny bones of the middle   |

|                                   |     obstructions. For example, do |

|                                   |     speaking. Many people use lip |

|                                   |     or try to find a quieter      |

|                                   |     confusing and uncomfortable   |

|                                   |     facial expression to enhance  |
|                                   |     the meaning of the discussion |

|                                   |     This is so the person is able |
|                                   |     to lip-read. Do not move      |
|                                   |     around whilst talking to a    |

|                                   | -   use short and straightforward |
|                                   |     sentences and repeat or       |
|                                   |     rephrase sentences if the     |
|                                   |     person misunderstands. If     |

|                                   |     and gestures to gain extra    |

|                                   |     being conveyed                |

|                                   |     encourage the speaker to      |
|                                   |     continue the conversation     |
|                                   |     even if it is difficult to    |

|                                   |     information needs to be       |

|                                   | -   only use words that are       |
|                                   |     common and understood by most |
|                                   |     people and always break long  |

|                                   |     is required, explain the      |
|                                   |     words and make sure that they |
