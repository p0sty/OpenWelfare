Example letter texts

Q999 - Text to be used where the enter care date differs from date
provided in pre-birth claim.

'I refer to your request to transfer your Parental Leave Pay entitlement
to <name of secondary claimant>. We were recently advised that this
transfer should start on <start date from post birth claim>. This date
is different from the date that you have previously advised.

In order to confirm the correct date to transfer your Parental Leave Pay
entitlement, please contact us on 136 150 by <due date for contact>. If
you do not contact us, Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for
<child's name>.'

Q999 - Secondary claimant applying for PPL when primary claimant has not
applied for PPL and is transferring some or all of their PPL entitlement

'In your claim you indicated that you are claiming Paid Parental Leave
because <your partner><someone> is transferring some or all their
entitlement to you. Before we can assess your entitlement to Parental
Leave Pay, the initial primary carer (that is, the birth mother), must
lodge a claim and establish their eligibility to Parental Leave Pay. If
they have returned to work before lodging their claim for Paid Parental
Leave, it is essential you both lodge your claims at the same time.

If <your partner><the person who is transferring their Parental Leave
Pay entitlement to you> does not submit a claim within 14 days of this
notice being issued, Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for <child's
name>'.

Q999 - Invite primary and/or secondary claimant to lodge PPL claim when
the primary claimant is transferring their full/partial PPL entitlement

'We are writing to invite you to claim Parental Leave Pay for <child's
name>. You can lodge your claim by either accessing your Centrelink
online account through myGov and selecting 'Make a claim' or if you are
unable to use our online services, contact us on 136150. You must lodge
your claim within 14 days of this notice being issued or Parental Leave
Pay may not be payable for <child's name>.'

Q999 NEF text to secondary claimant - Primary claimant did not submit an
effective PPL claim

'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because <your partner><the person
who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you> has not
submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay
for <child's name> you will need to contact us once <your partner><the
person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you>
has submitted their claim.'

Q999 NEF text to primary claimant - Secondary claimant did not submit an
effective PPL claim

'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because <your partner><the person
you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to> has not
submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay
for <child's name > you will need to contact us once <your partner><the
person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to > has
submitted their claim.'

|                                   | In the PPL claim, Fiona indicates |
|                                   | that Fiona will transfer primary  |
|                                   | care of the child to partner      |
|                                   | Philip on 20 July and will return |
|                                   | to work on the same day. Fiona    |
|                                   | wishes to transfer the full PPL   |
|                                   | period to Philip from 1 August.   |

|                                   | PPL days as Fiona intends to      |
|                                   | claim these later. Fiona's        |
|                                   | overall PPL claim remains open    |
|                                   | (OPN) pending the Flexible PPL    |
|                                   | days (PPL/CZR-FLX).               |

|                                   | Fiona meets all PPL eligibility   |
|                                   | criteria for each date from their |
|                                   | child's date of birth, up to and  |
|                                   | including 19 July (the day before |
|                                   | Fiona returned to work). As Fiona |
|                                   | is eligible for PPL, the full PPL |
|                                   | period can be transferred to      |
|                                   | Philip. Before Philip can be paid |
|                                   | PPL for the child, Philip must:   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     the same time as Fiona        |
|                                   | -   be eligible for PPL as a      |
|                                   |     secondary claimant, and       |
|                                   | -   satisfy the full PPL          |
|                                   |     eligibility criteria from 20  |
|                                   |     July, when Philip became the  |
|                                   |     child's primary carer         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Before Fiona's claim for PPL is   |
|                                   | finalised, a Q999 must be sent to |
|                                   | Fiona in Customer First advising  |
|                                   | that Philip must submit a claim   |
|                                   | for PPL within 14 days. A Q999    |
|                                   | must also be sent to Philip in    |
|                                   | Customer First advising Phillip   |
|                                   | to submit a claim for PPL within  |
|                                   | 14 days. If Philip does not       |
|                                   | submit a claim, Fiona's           |
|                                   | application for PPL will be not   |
|                                   | effective and PPL may not be      |
|                                   | payable for their child.          |

|                                   | secondary claimant only has       |

|                                   | Lisa had a baby on 20 September.  |
|                                   | Partner Brad lodges a claim for   |
|                                   | PPL 4 weeks later.                |

|                                   | In the PPL claim, Brad advises of |
|                                   | claiming PPL because Lisa is      |
|                                   | transferring the payment to him.  |
|                                   | Before assessing Brad's claim, a  |
|                                   | Q999 is sent in Customer First    |
|                                   | advising Brad that Lisa must      |
|                                   | submit a claim for PPL within 14  |
|                                   | days before Brad's entitlement to |
|                                   | PPL can be assessed. A Q999 is    |
|                                   | also sent to Lisa in Customer     |
|                                   | First advising to lodge a claim   |
|                                   | within 14 days.                   |

|                                   | On 2 November Lisa lodges a claim |
|                                   | for PPL, and in the claim         |
|                                   | indicates that Lisa has returned  |
|                                   | to work and transferred primary   |
|                                   | care of their child to Brad on 16 |
|                                   | October. Lisa also advises of the |

|                                   | PPL period to Brad from 16        |

|                                   | PPL days because Angie has        |
