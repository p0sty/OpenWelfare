This document outlines how Debt Staff can recover debt from customers
who live overseas.

Repayment of debt from overseas

Customers who have left Australia may contact Services Australia to ask
how they can repay their debt.

Options are:

BPAY from the customer's financial institution account. The agency does
not accept credit card payments via BPAY

Australia Post's POST billpay (via the Internet or phone). Acceptable
credit cards are:

-   Bankcard
-   Mastercard
-   Visa credit card
-   Visa or Mastercard debit card

Cheque, international money order or bank draft

'Wire payment' from their bank direct to the agency’s bank account

Garnishee or civil recovery

Note: it is not safe to send cash through the post. Do not provide this
as an option.

Assistance can be sourced from the Australian High Commission in the
country where the customer is now living. Always consider the cost
effectiveness of the recovery action.

If a customer returns to Australia while a debt is temporarily written
off, recovery will be triggered by:

-   automatic withholdings if the customer claims a payment from the
    agency, or
-   a data match with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) if the
    customer signs a Tax File Declaration Form (TDF)
