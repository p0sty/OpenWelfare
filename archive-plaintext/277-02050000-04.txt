Authorisations and delegations

Service Officer (SO3)

Process an inflation factor

Note: this does not prevent an officer at the SO2 level who has the
support of their team leader from carrying out this type of work.
However, the final decision to process an inflation factor must be made
by an officer at the SO3 level or above.

For more information about authorisations and delegations see Child
