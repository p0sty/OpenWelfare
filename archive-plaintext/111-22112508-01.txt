This document outlines the quality checking process using the Quality
and Support Tool (QST) in Health Service Delivery for the Medicare
Entitlement Statement (MES) program.

The MES quality checking process aligns Services Australia's Enterprise
Quality Framework and the 7 quality principles.

The quality checking process:

-   helps Team Leaders and Quality Checkers to identify process
    improvements

See Resources for a link to the Enterprise Quality Framework.

Roles and responsibilities

Managers/Team Leaders are responsible for making sure:

-   quality checkers complete the process for quality checker
    accreditation

    an email to the Quality Operations and Technical Support team
-   timely error feedback is discussed with Service Officer as part of
    the coaching conversation to support any learning and development
    opportunities
-   errors are analysed. If errors occurred because of factors such as
    limited training, understanding the business rules, environmental or
    system based issues
-   positive quality checking outcomes are acknowledged with Service
    Officer
-   analysis of data to identify learning needs or process improvement
    opportunities

Quality Checkers are responsible for:

-   Carrying out quality checks as specified in the sampling plan
-   Updating and maintaining technical knowledge, procedures and
    policies

selected, they must give it to another staff member who has been trained
to conduct quality checks.

Quality Team is responsible for:

-   Providing support for quality checking in the QST
-   Providing relevant reports as required
-   Arranging QST training for quality checkers
-   Supporting the business with flexible and fit for purpose quality
    approaches

    checking
-   have an understanding of the quality checking procedure
-   meet accreditation standards annually

Quality Checking accreditation must be renewed annually.

Types of quality checks

Pre-checks

New starters have 100% of their work reviewed and corrected until deemed
proficient. Any errors made in pre-check must be recorded as errors.

Programme/Post-checks

Programme/Post-checking randomly selects work completed the previous
business day in Processing and National Demand Allocation (PaNDA). The
results are provided to management and external stakeholders as needed.

Targeted Checks

Targeted checks apply to the following scenarios:

-   in response to business triggers or when there is a
    consistent/long-term quality issue identified
-   to Aim for Accuracy process (Check the Checker) which is completed
    every 12 months. This is to confirm the accuracy of quality checking
    results. The process involves re-checking a representative sample of
    previously checked work to determine if quality checking procedures
    have been followed correctly

To arrange a targeted check(s), Team Leaders send an email to the
Services Delivery Quality and Support Team with the:

-   staff member’s details, and
-   reason and length of time needed for the targeted check

Sampling plan

Pre-checks

Pre-checks proficiency requirements for new starters will be advised in
the scope of training details.

Programme/Post-checks

Between 0.1-1% of the monthly total of the below MES PaNDA work types
are randomly selected for quality checking:

-   MES
-   RHCA

Targeted Checks

Discuss Targeted Checks with the Quality Operations and Technical
Support team.

Process for quality checks

Timeframes

Quality checks are:

-   undertaken daily on a random sample of work
-   completed within 1-2 business days to make sure timely feedback

Quality checkers must have access to the following to undertake quality
checks:

-   Program specific processing systems
-   Processing and National Demand allocation (PaNDA)
-   QST
-   Skill tags added on the QST

Error definition

For the purpose of quality checking, an error is information
processed/keyed into the system which does not match:

-   the documentation submitted, or
-   the supporting documents uploaded to the systems

Critical and non-critical errors

Error codes are categorised as critical and non-critical.

An error is defined as critical when there is a potential risk to:

a customer's:

-   privacy
-   eligibility
-   payments
-   application assessment being finalised
-   record

An error is defined as non-critical when it does not meet the above
criteria. Generally, this relates to administrative errors.

Only critical errors are used to calculate the health status of the
program.

Recording results

Each time a quality check is completed, the Quality Checker records the
outcome in QST.

A system-generated email is sent in real time to the Service Officer and
their Team Leader advising them of the quality check outcome.

Individual results are captured in QST.

their Team Leader. The email includes details about the:

-   check

technical enquires.

that cannot be resolved on site should be directed by email to the
Quality Operations and Technical Support team.
