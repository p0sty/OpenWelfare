This document explains how to negotiate a Job Plan with a job seeker.

Job seekers required to agree to a Job Plan

A Job Plan is an Employment Pathway Plan or Individual Participation
Plan for the purpose of social security law.

Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must agree to a Job Plan
to qualify for income support payments. A Job Plan records the
requirements the job seeker will do to meet their mutual obligation
requirements.

Note: from 4 December 2021, job seekers in Workforce Australia Online
who are subject to RapidConnect will need to complete a career profile
before they are presented with a Job Plan.

Job seekers are either Centrelink or Employment Services Provider
managed. Staff are unable to negotiate a Job Plan for provider managed
job seekers. The organisation responsible for the ongoing management of
the job seeker will negotiate their Job Plan.

All job seekers with mutual obligation requirements must negotiate and
agree to a Job Plan within:

-   4 business days of their first regular payment, or
-   within 14 days of a change of circumstance

To negotiate a Job Plan, job seekers with mutual obligation requirements
must have an active Job Seeker Identification status with one of the
following registration types:

-   Fully Eligible Participant (FEP)
-   Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No Remote Referral Required
    (NRRR) job seeker, or
-   Remote fully eligible

The Job Plan must be tailored to the job seeker's needs.

A compulsory Job Plan must be negotiated for job seekers with mutual
obligation requirements except where the job seeker has a:

-   current temporary exemption from their mutual obligation
    requirements
-   pending Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) or Job Capacity
    Assessment (JCA) and their capacity to participate is undetermined

Centrelink managed job seekers

Centrelink managed job seekers who are able to fully meet their mutual
obligation requirements by participation in a Centrelink approved
requirement.

Other job seekers are Centrelink managed because of their assessed
capacity to work or because they have been granted an exemption from
meeting mutual obligation requirements.

Centrelink managed job seekers are:

-   principal carers fully meeting requirements (through paid work,
    self-employment, study, or a combination)
-   mature age job seekers 55+(through paid work, self-employment,
    voluntary work, or a combination)
-   job seekers assessed as having partial capacity to work (PCW) of
    less than 15hrs per week work capacity (Quarterly Participation
    Interviews)
-   job seekers assessed as having partial capacity to work (PCW) 15-29
    hours per week (through paid work or self-employment)
-   job seekers assessed as having temporary reduced work capacity
    (TRWC) of less than 15hrs per week work capacity (Quarterly
    Participation Interviews)
-   job seekers with an exemption from their mutual obligation
    requirements (noting they do not require a Job Plan)
-   customers who are current on income support payment and
    participating in Small Business Coaching under Self-Employment
    Assistance (except ParentsNext customers will remain provider
    managed by their ParentsNext provider)
-   principal carer parents participating in Defence Force Reserves
-   job seekers doing Youth Activities
-   most newly arrived refugees who are in the 13 week period post the
    end of their refugee exemption

Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements will appear as
Centrelink Managed if they:

are not fully meeting requirements, and

have not been referred to:

-   Workforce Australia Online, or
-   an Employment Services Provider

This includes job seekers with a pending Job Seeker snapshot awaiting an
ESAt to determine their:

-   capacity to participate
-   most appropriate Employment Services referral option (if applicable)

These job seekers cannot have a job plan negotiated until:

their ESAt/JCA is accepted, and

they attend a Quarterly Participation Interview, or

they are referred to an Employment Service and:

-   agree to their job plan online, or
-   their Employment Service Provider manages the negotiation of the job
    seekers job plan (Provider Managed)

The Key Information screen and Job Plan Status screen in Process Direct
will show:

-   the job seeker's participation category
-   if there is a current Job Plan, and
-   if the job seeker is Centrelink managed or provider managed

Staff must identify where a provider managed job seeker should be
Centrelink managed, for example where they are fully meeting their
requirements through an approved activity or programme. After coding the
Activity and Exemption (AEX) screen, do not attempt to negotiate a Job
Plan until the job seeker's record changes to Centrelink managed. The
exception to this is job seekers participating in a Disability
Employment Services (DES) program and doing paid work. See also: Paid
work as an approved activity.

Note: the Action Item Customer is Centrelink managed and has no current
Job Plan. Negotiate Job Plan with customer, may appear for ESL job
seekers who:

-   are participating full time in AMEP, and
-   are yet to be referred to an Employment Services Provider

These job seekers are not Centrelink managed and must be referred to a
Provider. Once referred, they will display as Provider managed.

Options for negotiating Job Plans

Job Plans may be negotiated by suitably skilled staff either in person
or over the phone where all necessary documentation and/or information
is available. Job seekers must formally agree with the Job Plan either
by signing a printed copy, or by using their [] Centrelink online
account (not including the Centrelink app) to provide agreement. Job
Plans cannot be finalised by verbal agreement.

Some Centrelink managed job seekers who have signed up for Centrelink
Online Services and are fully meeting their mutual obligation
requirements can have their Job Plan updated automatically when the
requirement end date is reached by completing an Online Task. These job
seekers then use the View and Agree Job Plan online service to agree to
their Job Plan.

[] If the Job Plan is negotiated via phone, the job seeker should access
their Centrelink online account and finalise the plan while they are
still on the phone. It will be available immediately. If the job seeker
does not have a Centrelink online account, the Job Plan can be mailed to
them, or they can go to a service centre to sign it. Note: remote job
seekers can post their signed Job Plans.

The job seeker does not need to agree to the Job Plan immediately but
must agree to it within 28 days. The following timeframes apply:

-   2 days - reminder message for job seeker with an online account
-   14 days - reminder letter
-   28 days - payments suspended

Appropriateness of Job Plans

Services Australia is responsible for ensuring that Centrelink managed
job seekers have appropriate requirements in their Job Plan.

An appropriate Job Plan must be negotiated with a job seeker by the
agency where:

-   their Job Plan is no longer current (for example, a job-seeker with
    voluntary work as their approved requirement commences part-time
    work)
-   any requirement in the Centrelink negotiated Job Plan is more than
    12 months old
-   the job seeker is now Centrelink managed as they have commenced an
    activity which will fully meet their mutual obligation requirements
-   the job seeker is returning to an income support payment, even if
    the requirements in their new Job Plan are the same as they had
    during a previous period of payment

Some job seekers will have their approved part-time work (PTW) or
self-employment (SEL) requirement auto-updated if they:

-   are a principal carer, and
-   are receiving JobSeeker Payment (JSP), Parenting Payment Single, or
    Youth Allowance (job seeker), and
-   have declared in the last 2 consecutive fortnights that they have
    worked at least 30 hours each fortnight and earned income equal to
    or above the national minimum wage

A new Centrelink Managed Job Plan must still be negotiated for these job
seekers.

Negotiating a Job Plan during claims processing

At new claim, where a job seeker's circumstances, for example, partial
capacity to work (PCW) or the requirements they are already undertaking,
mean they can be Centrelink managed, staff should negotiate Job Plans as
part of the new claim finalisation process.

If a job seeker is proposing to do an activity that will fully meet
their requirements, or they cannot yet provide the required verification
at new claim, their requirement must be approved as soon as possible
after grant. In the meantime, the job seeker must be referred to an
Employment Service and commence meeting the requirements of a provider
negotiated Job Plan. The job seeker will be provider managed until
Centrelink has the information and verification needed to approve an
activity that is fully meeting their requirements.

If a Job Seeker Snapshot is run during the job seeker's online claim
appointment resulting in a pending status, a job plan cannot be
negotiated until their:

-   ESAt is completed, and
-   capacity to participate is known

Full-time students

Full-time students will not normally be required to negotiate a Job
Plan.

The exception is Vulnerable Youth (Students) offered provider-led
services (provider managed) assistance, who will negotiate a Job Plan
with their Workforce Australia provider. Vulnerable Youth (Students) in
a designated Community Development Program (CDP) region will negotiate a
Job Plan with their CDP provider.

The Resources page contains contact information for support with Job
Plans.
