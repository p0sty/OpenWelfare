|                                   | established. The job seeker was   |
|                                   | unable to verify their statement  |
|                                   | that they received another offer  |

|                                   | Greater weight was given to the   |

|                                   | notes were well documented. This  |
|                                   | included their negotiation with   |

|                                   | court attendance. The provider's  |
|                                   | evidence is fully substantiated.  |
|                                   | Although some facts of the job    |
|                                   | seeker's statement are correct,   |
|                                   | it did not include the fact they  |
|                                   | agreed to make up the WFD hours   |
|                                   | on the Thursday.                  |
