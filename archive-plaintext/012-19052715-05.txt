+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Structure of a provider number    | -   PDS generates a unique 6      |
|                                   |     digit number called a         |
|                                   |     Medicare provider stem. The   |
|                                   |     stem consists of 6 numerals,  |
|                                   |     for example 123456            |
|                                   | -   When a practice location      |
|                                   |     address is added, an          |
|                                   |     additional alpha or numeral   |
|                                   |     is added followed by an alpha |
|                                   |     check digit. For example,     |
|                                   |     1234561A                      |
|                                   | -   As additional locations are   |
|                                   |     added, the next number in the |
|                                   |     location check digit          |
|                                   |     algorithm is applied. For     |
|                                   |     example, 1234562T, 1234563Z   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Multiple stems                    | Each provider stem can have up to |
|                                   | 31 locations added to it.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When locations exceed 31, PDS     |
|                                   | automatically creates a new stem  |
|                                   | is and links to the existing      |
|                                   | stem.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Leading zeros                     | -   Occurs when a provider stem   |
|                                   |     or location does not have     |
|                                   |     full 6 digits. For example,   |
|                                   |     provider location number      |
|                                   |     4561A would be 0004561A       |
|                                   | -   All 8 characters (including   |
|                                   |     leading zeros) must be        |
|                                   |     included in written           |

|                                   |     professional                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: leading zeros are often not |
|                                   | included on applications and      |

|                                   | including leading zeros must be   |
|                                   | undertaken.                       |
