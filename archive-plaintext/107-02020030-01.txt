This document provides information about negative adjustments resulting
from a reassessment of a customer's entitlement. This includes
explaining, actioning and documenting adjustments. When a Child Care
Subsidy (CCS) entitlement is reassessed, the adjustment (either negative
or positive) cannot be amended.

Service Officer role in explaining a negative adjustment

If a negative adjustment results from a reassessment of a customer’s
record, it is the responsibility of the Service Officer undertaking the
reassessment to advise the customer of the result.

The Service Officer, having just recorded the change/s leading to the
negative adjustment, is best placed to provide the customer with an
explanation. For assistance in identifying and explaining a negative
adjustment, see the Process page.

Identifying negative adjustments that auto raise on completion of the
activity

A negative adjustment resulting from earnings coded for a past period,
where the duration is one fortnight or less, will automatically raise on
completion of the earnings activity. This occurs regardless of whether
the earnings coding is staff assisted or the customer has provided the
update using online services. These debts can be identified by the:

-   duration of the debt, that is, debt period is from 1-14 days,
    maximum, and
-   debt reason code is IEA – Income Earnings Automatic. The reason code
    is located on the Debt List (OPDL) screen under 'Reason'

Explaining a one fortnight duration earned income (IEA) auto raised debt

This type of debt occurs where the customer has initially under-declared
or failed to report their employment income. When the income is
corrected or reported, a recalculation of the customer's entitlement
identifies a debt for one entitlement period only. These debts are
automatically raised by the system.

Negative adjustment

Reassessment of a customer's entitlement may lead to:

-   underpayment (positive adjustment), or
-   overpayment (negative adjustment)

An investigation of a negative adjustment can result in:

-   no recoverable debt
-   a recoverable debt raised
-   a recoverable debt raised and partially waived
-   a recoverable debt fully waived

Debts less than $50 are waived automatically. However, the following
debts are excluded and must be investigated:

-   Family Assistance
-   ABSTUDY
-   Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
-   Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) debts

Identification of debt

Consider:

-   what action generated the debt
-   if the debt is legally recoverable

Before making a decision on further action, Service Officers must:

-   check the system to establish payment history
-   determine whether the customer has complied with the notification
    provisions
-   determine whether relevant protocols were followed

Automatically raised debts

Debts are raised automatically upon finalisation of an earnings or
payment stimulus activity or workflow where the:

-   debt relates to an income support payment that is recoverable under
    the Social Security Act
-   debt period is not greater than 14 days (one fortnight) in duration
-   debt does not include a Student Start Up Scholarship, Relocation
    Scholarship or Carer Supplement Payment, and
-   customer does not have a deceased estate pending, bankruptcy or
    imprisonment debt write off in place

During a conversation when updating earnings, the customer must be told
about:

-   the debt, and
-   their internal review options
