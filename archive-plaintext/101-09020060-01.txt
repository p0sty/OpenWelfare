Important information
An Income statement is used by a business approved to use Centrelink
Confirmation eServices (CCeS). It shows the gross value (circumstances
data) of all income and asset types for a customer. It includes any that
are exempt under a Centrelink income and asset test. It allows a
business to assess the customer's financial circumstances and
eligibility for a service. Income statements do not show assessable
data.
A Centrelink statement is used if a customer needs to show the details
Services Australia use to assess eligibility, not an Income statement.
See Differences between Income statements and Centrelink statements.

This document outlines information about the Income statement and the
Detailed income and asset statement, and how to issue the statements to
customers and registered businesses. The statements have customer income
and asset information that can be provided to businesses to help with
the eligibility for a concession, rebate or service.

    eligible for a concession, rebate or service

    most recent payments)
