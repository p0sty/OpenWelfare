Customers eligible for Working Credit or Work Bonus

For customers eligible for Working Credit, accrual and depletion of
Working Credits depends on income being identified as employment income
or other ordinary income. Total ordinary income is made up of employment
income and other ordinary income. Working Credits can reduce the effects
of employment income on a customer's income support payment.

For customers eligible for the Work Bonus accrual and depletion is only
effected by eligible income, which is:

-   employment income and
-   self-employment income earned through personal exertion

The Work Bonus can reduce the effect of eligible income on a customer's
income support payment.

Work Bonus will be able to be applied to royalty or commission payments
(type ROC) recorded on OIN.

The effect of other ordinary income cannot be reduced by depletion of
Working Credits or the Work Bonus.

The exception to this is customers who are undertaking full-time study
or who are an Australian Apprentice and are in receipt of ABSTUDY,
Austudy, or Youth Allowance. These customers have access to Income Bank
credits for any personal income earned.
