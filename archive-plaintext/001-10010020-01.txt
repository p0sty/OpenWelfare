This document outlines Services Australia's roles and responsibilities
in managing job seeker compliance with compulsory requirements and
re-engagement following non-compliance. Note: the term 'job seeker' in
this file also refers to Community Development Program (CDP)
participants.

Key messages for job seekers

Services Australia staff are responsible for ensuring job seekers are
aware of their participation requirements and the consequences if they
do not meet them, this includes:

-   looking for all types of work
-   reminding job seekers to ensure they tell their provider if they are
    unable to comply or if their circumstances change which may impact
    their ability to comply
-   recording personal events in their electronic calendar so the
    provider is aware of any personal commitments when setting
    requirements
-   participate in employment services and other activities based on
    their assessed capacity/circumstances
-   contacting their provider if they are unable to meet a requirement
    before it starts
-   be aware of what will happen if they do not comply with
    requirements, and
-   to contact and re-connect with their provider as soon as possible if
    they miss a requirement

Identifying circumstances impacting job seeker compliance

Services Australia staff may identify a job seeker has circumstances
impacting their ability to meet their compulsory requirements. It is
important where a circumstance is identified the job seeker's record is
updated. The Circumstance impacting Compliance (CiC) page is used to
record the circumstance and its impact. Updating a job seeker's record
will help to ensure:

-   the provider considers the job seeker circumstances when updating
    their Job Plan
-   if non-compliance does occur, their circumstances will be considered
    during a failure investigation

Recording a job seeker circumstance can happen during any contact with a
job seeker, including where:

-   Participation Solution Team (PST) staff conduct a compliance
    investigation, Capability Assessment or Comprehensive Compliance
    Assessment (CCA)
-   Social worker assistance is received
-   Specialist officers such as Community Engagement Officers,
    Multicultural Services Officers or Indigenous Service Officers
    provide assistance to staff
-   Prison Liaison Officers assist job seekers who are released from
    prison
-   Services Australia staff assist a vulnerable job seeker who
    indicates ongoing circumstances are impacting their ability to
    comply

Note: PST staff must consult with a PST-skilled social worker where the
job seeker presents with family and domestic violence or has a current
Family relationships/Domestic violence circumstance recorded. See
Accessing a PST-skilled social worker.

Job seeker contact following a missed requirement or participation suspension

Job seekers who contact Services Australia about a participation related
payment suspension, may need to contact either their provider or the PST
about a compliance investigation.

Staff must check which compliance system applies to the job seeker,
then:

-   tell the job seeker to contact their provider, and/or
-   transfer the job seeker to the PST if an outstanding failure
    requires investigation

Job seekers, who fail to meet a requirement and fail to re-engage with
their provider within 29 days, will have their payment automatically
cancelled.

Targeted Compliance Framework

All staff are responsible for generating an unemployment failure where
there is evidence to suggest the job seeker is voluntarily unemployed or
dismissed due to misconduct. Generation of the failure can occur when
the job seeker is:

-   claiming a participation payment, or
-   in receipt of a participation payment

PST staff with either WNPPD security resource or a UNPP security
resource investigate and determine unemployment failures.

PST staff conducting Capability Assessments may consult social workers
or other Services Australia specialists during the assessment. For
further information, see Social work role in the Participation Solutions
Team (PST).

PST staff also investigate and determine reasonable excuse or misconduct
for:

-   work refusal failures
-   unemployment failures
-   mutual obligation failures for job seekers who are in the penalty
    zone

PST staff will tell job seekers the outcome of all Targeted Compliance
Framework decisions, consequences of these decisions, and their review
and appeal rights.

Job Seeker Compliance Framework

PST staff investigate and determine reasonable excuse or misconduct,
whether generated by Services Australia, or via a Community Development
Program (CDP) provider.

PST staff will:

-   re-engage CDP participants to their provider where appropriate
-   restore certain participation suspensions after a CDP participant
    accepts a reconnection requirement
-   advise the job seeker of the outcome of decisions made by Services
    Australia, consequences of these decisions, and their review and
    appeal rights
-   explain and apply serious failure waiver provisions, and schedule a
    waiver re-engagement appointments with CDP providers
-   explain Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) hardship provisions
-   implement Payment Pending Review (PPR) provisions if a UNPP or
    serious failure is applied and the CDP participant seeks a formal
    review by an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) or the Administrative
    Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

All staff are responsible for generating a UNPP for investigation where
there is evidence to suggest the job seeker is voluntarily unemployed or
dismissed due to misconduct. Generation of the failure can occur when
the job seeker is:

-   claiming a participation payment, or
-   in receipt of a participation payment

PST staff are responsible for preparing for Comprehensive Compliance
Assessments (CCA). PST staff who are also a SO5 or social workers
conduct these assessments.
