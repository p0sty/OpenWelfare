This document outlines the definition of a special course for a
dependent student who is claiming the living away from home rate due to
needing to attend a special course.

Special course

To be considered as a special course, the course must be one of the
following:

-   a full-time secondary course where the student receives a formal
    specialising qualification on completion
-   formal specialising qualification for mature age students
-   a secondary course which is a prerequisite for entry to a specific
    post-secondary course
-   a secondary course containing agricultural subjects
-   specialist secondary studies in drama, music, art, ballet, sport or
    technology

Away from Home rate

ABSTUDY may be approved at a higher rate for Students who need to live
away from home to undertake study in a special course.

The away from home rate may be approved if:

-   government schools within reasonable travelling time are unable to
    cater for a secondary student's educational needs because of their
    special course requirements, and
-   the student needs to attend a school away from home

Students may not be approved for the away from home rate if an
applicable special course is available at a local government school
within reasonable travelling time or distance.

Note: dependent secondary students studying a qualifying special course
by distance education/correspondence are not eligible for the away from
home rate under the special course provision.

The Resources page contains a list of schools with special programs
approved for the away from home rate of ABSTUDY.
