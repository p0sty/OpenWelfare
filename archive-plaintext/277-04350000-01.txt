This document outlines the considerations and action to take when there
is excess cash on a Child Support account.

Manage excess cash

In most cases, excess cash occurs when a customer’s account is in credit
because they or their employer paid more than the child support
liability registered for collection by Child Support.

This document outlines how to identify and manage excess cash when:

-   there is no ongoing liability
-   there is an ongoing liability and 1 month’s liability exceeds the
    excess cash amount
-   the customer requests the excess cash be refunded, for example
    private collect or ended cases
-   the customer chooses to gift the excess cash

The document also explains the processes to follow when a customer
advises they have not received the excess cash refund.

Note: there are different processes for managing excess cash and
overpayments. For managing overpayments, see Child support overpayments
and other payee debt. If a Refund Reversal intray generates due to the
return of an Auto-Refund overpayment refund, see the Process page.
