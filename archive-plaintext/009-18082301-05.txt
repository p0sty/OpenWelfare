Tax-free pensions and benefits

    for are under Age Pension age

    Pension, where the recipient is under Age Pension age

-   DVA service pension and partner service pension where both partners
    are under Age Pension age and the veteran receives an invalidity
    service pension at the time of death
-   DVA income support supplement paid on the grounds of invalidity if
    the person is under Age Pension age
-   DVA Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA), if the income
    support payment being received is not taxable, DFISA is not taxable

    the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act (MRCA)
-   Compensation for permanent impairment paid under the MRCA
-   Additional compensation for impairment from another service injury
    or disease paid under the MRCA
-   Interim compensation paid under the MRCA while waiting for

    compensation payment for impairment from another service injury or

-   Compensation payments made under 234(1)(b) of the MRCA would be
    included in the widow's estimate of Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI).
    Compensation payment made under paragraph 234(1)(a) of the MRCA (the
    wholly dependent partner death benefit) to an eligible widow, will
    be disregarded for FTB income assessment and Parental Income Test
    purposes
-   Compensation payments made under both sections 252 and 254 of the
    MRCA to children of a widow

If a payment does not appear in the list above, it is not a tax free
pension or benefit for the purposes of calculating the ATI for the CA
income test.

For example, Prisoner of War Recognition Supplement from the Department
of Veterans' Affairs is not taxable income. It is also exempt income for
social security purposes. However, it is not a tax-free pension or
benefit for the purpose of Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) for CA.

Payments made by Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission

These payments can be paid as fortnightly instalments or as a lump sum.
Lump sums are to be treated as income in the tax year they are received.
The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission can make
payments under 2 Acts:

-   Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act (MRCA)
-   Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA)

Only certain MRCA payments are included as part of the CA ATI These are
included in the first list above.

Non-taxable components

The following non-taxable components are not included as part of the
person's ATI for CA:

-   Bereavement period payments, excluding the amount of a Lump Sum
    Bereavement Payment (LBP) above the tax free amount paid to a

    obligation requirements. See Exempting a job seeker from mutual
    obligation requirements due to special circumstances. The exemption
    can be identified on the Activity and Exemption Summary (AEX) screen
-   Pension Supplement paid by DVA - all components of the Pension
