Example of accounts/ invoices showing different referral dates

Table 2: this table provides examples of how referral information may
appear on provider accounts/ invoices and which date to select when
processing claims.

Note: Health Professionals software may enter an alternative date that
assists with calculating the referral validity period. The date the
referral was issued (written) by the referring provider is the date that
is to be used for Medicare purposes.
