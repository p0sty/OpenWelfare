|                                   | to use CCeS to confirm if a       |
|                                   | customer has a current concession |

|                                   | transport. CCeS will confirm if   |

|                                   | providing a Yes/No response,      |

|                                   | customer’s payment type as it is  |
|                                   | not required for the concession   |

|                                   | Customers can print income        |
|                                   | statements using online services. |
|                                   | Businesses should encourage       |

|                                   | rather than assisting customers   |

|                                   | print income statements, its      |
|                                   | application to use CCeS would be  |

|                                   | business based on the business    |
|                                   | category it belongs to. Some      |
|                                   | business categories will allow a  |
|                                   | business to confirm the type and  |
|                                   | status of the relevant payment    |

|                                   | enquiring about. For example,     |

| 14                                | How is CCeS different to being a  |
|                                   | correspondence nominee, and is it |
|                                   | an easier process to just be a    |
|                                   | nominee?                          |

|                                   | are different. CCeS is a service  |
|                                   | to confirm customer information   |
|                                   | only. It does not provide a       |
|                                   | channel for a business to make    |
|                                   | updates or act on behalf of the   |
|                                   | customer like an appointed        |
|                                   | nominee is able to do.            |
