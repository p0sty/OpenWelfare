This document outlines information for staff about releasing information
about a deceased person under Public Interest guidelines for the
Centrelink program. Every request needs a response.

Calls received about a deceased person

When a person calls and enters the Customer Reference Number (CRN) for a
deceased customer, a message will display in Services Australia
Workspace. This alerts the Service Officer to the sensitivity of the
call. For more information, see Telephone standards.

The caller may be:

-   Authorised to make enquiries about the deceased person’s
    information. They may be the executor or administrator of the
    estate, with evidence and a request made in writing on the
    Executor/Administrator Request for information (SS524) form
-   Enquiring about what Bereavement Services are available to them,
    such as the surviving partner or carer. See About Bereavement
    services
-   Enquiring about the deceased person’s details but does not have
    authority, such as a family member or friend. Note: do not give any
    details about the deceased person (including whether they were a
    customer), unless the caller has given enough evidence of their
    authority

Requests for information

Executors/administrators often ask for information after someone has
died so they can finalise the estate. These requests should be in
writing and preferably made using the Executor/Administrator Request for
information (SS524) form.

Executors/administrators may ask for details of the deceased person,
such as:

-   bank account details
-   declared income and assets
-   if there is any pension or benefit entitlements
-   if Services Australia has a claim against the estate, or
-   if there are outstanding debts or money owing
-   a statement of pension or benefit for current/previous financial
    years

All requests must have proof that the person is the nominated
executor/administrator. The will of the deceased person usually
identifies the executors.

Note: it is generally accepted that a Public Trustee or a solicitor is
administering an estate when they officially write to the agency and
state this.

If a person dies without a will (intestate), the spouse, partner or next
of kin should apply to the Probate Office of the Supreme Court for
letters of administration. The court will appoint a personal
representative (that is, an administrator) to finalise the deceased
person's affairs.

This does not apply to small estates (worth less than $10,000). Small
estates can be referred to the State or Territory Public Trustees, which
have additional powers in dealing with small estates. The Public Trustee
usually verifies their role when they request information for:

-   small estates, and
-   court appointed administration of deceased estates

Only give information to:

-   the executor as named in the will
-   the Public Trustee
-   a court
-   the administrator of the estate
-   state and territory government departments assessing burial/funeral
    assistance

Requests for returned payments

An executor of the estate or appropriate person can apply for any of the
deceased’s payments that the financial institution has returned. See
Replacing payment made to a deceased customer where payment was returned
from financial institution.

Delegations for disclosure of information

The Resources page has links to:

-   Delegations and Authorisations Register
-   Centrelink Services, Delegations and Authorisations
-   Child Support Services, Delegations and Authorisations
-   Medicare Services, Delegations and Authorisations

For Centrelink, a Public Interest Release of Information Form must be
completed when information is disclosed to a person or authority other
than an executor or administrator for this estate.

Recording executor details

Record executor details on the Death/Executor (DEA) screen. Record the
proof sighted on a DOC before Services Australia can:

-   issue arrears
-   complete debt recovery action, or
-   issue payment summaries.

Sending a letter about a deceased person

Only suitably skilled Service Officers should prepare letters providing
information about a deceased person in response to an
Executor/Administrator Request for information (SS524) form. A staff
member with the appropriate delegation level must approve and issue
these letters. The delegation is with a staff member at or above APS4
level for the Q126 and QTAXCH letters. Send a Q999 (free text) letter to
give further information if needed. A staff member at or above the APS5
level must check Q999 letters before they are issued unless pre-approved
text is used. For more information, see Creating a Q999 or Q888 letter.

Proof of executor or administrator status

Proof of executor or administrator status is always required before
releasing any information or taking follow-up action to contact or
advise the estate on matters such as debts or payments owed. A copy of
the deceased person's will should show if there is an executor and
identify them.

Record information about the executor or administrator (including
disputed executor or administrator roles) on a DOC on the deceased
person's record.

Nominee arrangements, Guardianship Orders, Financial Management Orders,
Administrations Orders (issued before death) and Power of Attorney (POA)
cease at the time of death. These should not be relied upon as an
authority to receive information about the deceased person. People who
were nominee or POA do not automatically become the executor or
administrator. A statutory declaration from a person who does not hold
an appropriate authority cannot be used as authorisation for access to a
deceased person's information. Advise the person to seek advice from a
lawyer, Probate Office or Public Trustee.

Life insurance and superannuation companies can request information to:

-   confirm that a deceased person who held a policy or was a member of
    a fund was not a customer of Services Australia, or
-   request contact details for a beneficiary

State and territory government departments that provide burial/funeral
assistance may request information about assets held by the deceased
person. This information will determine eligibility for funeral
assistance.

It is extremely important to action all requests urgently.

Note: do not give a third party any information (including whether the
deceased person was a customer) unless they have given enough evidence
of their authority. See Disclosing information to third parties.

Executor/Administrator Request for information (SS524) form

The SS524 form is the preferred method to request Centrelink information
from Services Australia about a deceased person. The form states what
Centrelink information can be given, to whom and what proof of executor
or administrator status is needed.

Note: when an executor or administrator makes a request by letter,
accept and process the request and encourage the executor or
administrator to use the SS524 in the future.

The Resources page includes a link to the SS524 form.

Requests for Medicare information

For requests for Medicare information about a deceased person, see
Release of information for Medicare.

Requests for Child Support information

For requests for Child Support information about a deceased payer, payee
or child, see Deceased Child Support Customer Management.
