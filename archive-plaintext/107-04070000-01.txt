This document provides information on identifying, raising and
recovering PPL and DAP debts from customers and employers.

Customer debts

Raise Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) debts for
the following reasons:

-   not providing care
-   duplicate payment
-   payment made after death
-   not eligible for payment
-   incorrect bank account (third party - individual)
-   false/multiple identity
-   internal fraud
-   false statement/misrepresentation

Employer debts

Raise Organisation debts for PPL for the following reasons:

-   claimant not entitled to payment
-   payment not forwarded
-   notification failure - employer
-   duplicate payment
-   incorrect bank account (third party - organisation)
-   false/multiple identity
-   internal fraud
-   false statement/misrepresentation

If the employer:

-   has not yet paid the money to the employee, the debt is recovered
    from the employer
-   has paid the money to the employee, the money is recovered from the
    employee

Where the employer pays the PPL to the wrong person, they need to
recover this amount.
