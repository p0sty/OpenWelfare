| 2                                 | Do I need to check if the patient |
|                                   | has had an initial before         |

|                                   | There are parameters built into   |
|                                   | the system that will check that   |
|                                   | an initial has been provided      |
|                                   | before a continuing is approved.  |
|                                   | If there is a rejection message   |
|                                   | suggesting no initial has not     |
|                                   | been approved but the prescriber  |
|                                   | indicates the patient has had the |
|                                   | initial authority approval,       |
|                                   | search the patient’s history on   |
|                                   | mainframe/OPA for confirmation    |
|                                   | and escalate to a PA if you       |
|                                   | suspect there is incorrect        |
|                                   | rejection.                        |
