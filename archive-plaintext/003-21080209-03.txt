Workflows are only available when a claiming period for a relevant
period starts.

All online claims that do not meet eligibility requirements can be
rejected, except when the customer has a pending income support payment.

For staff not trained in assessing claims, complete a cold (unannounced)
transfer to 'ISP200 COVID-19 Disaster Payment' in Services Australia
Workspace.

Do not process Abridged Customer Claims, as these are finalised
automatically. This can take up to 14 calendar days. Do not contact
Technical Peer Support about un-finalised abridged claims. Do not tell a
customer to withdraw an abridged claim and resubmit it, as this may
cause further delays.
