|                                   |     and Zinnia must still meet    |

|                                   |     Zinnia will still need to     |
|                                   |     meet their full monthly       |

|                                   |     search requirements. Neither  |

|                                   |     applied                       |

|                                   | Alyce has committed 3 mutual      |
|                                   | obligation failures. Alyce's      |
|                                   | first, second and third penalty   |
|                                   | form a failure group. Alyce's     |
|                                   | payment was cancelled when the    |
|                                   | third penalty was applied.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alyce applied for a formal review |
|                                   | of decision of the third          |
|                                   | financial penalty within 13       |
|                                   | weeks. This decision was set      |
|                                   | aside by the Authorised Review    |
|                                   | Officer (ARO). The failure is     |
|                                   | revoked and Alyce's payment is    |
|                                   | restored from the date of effect  |
|                                   | of the non-compliance             |
|                                   | cancellation.                     |

|                                   | The system will, however,         |
|                                   | continue to maintain the 3        |
|                                   | penalties as a failure group.     |
|                                   | This means that if a subsequent   |
|                                   | financial penalty is applied, it  |
|                                   | will form a new failure group.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The grouping of penalties ensures |
|                                   | that where an outcome of a        |
|                                   | decision being reviewed is        |
|                                   | favourable, job seekers will not  |
|                                   | be adversely affected.            |
