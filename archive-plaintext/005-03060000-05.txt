| 1                                 | For example, the assuree claims   |
|                                   | fraudulently, the assuree         |
|                                   | incorrectly declares earnings:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where a recoverable payment is    |
|                                   | made to an assuree in accordance  |
|                                   | with social security law during   |
|                                   | the AoS period:                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   An AoS debt is raised by the  |
|                                   |     AoS Processing team under     |
|                                   |     section 1227 of the Social    |
|                                   |     Security Act 1991             |
|                                   | -   Liability for repayment of an |
|                                   |     AoS debt rests with the       |
|                                   |     assurer/s                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the assuree is paid an amount  |
|                                   | to which they are not entitled    |
|                                   | and it is determined this amount  |
|                                   | is a legally recoverable debt.    |
|                                   | The:                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   debt is raised against the    |
|                                   |     assuree under the relevant    |
|                                   |     legislation (for example,     |
|                                   |     section 1223 of the Social    |
|                                   |     Security Act 1991)            |
|                                   | -   assuree, not the assurer, is  |
|                                   |     liable to repay these amounts |
|                                   | -   normal debt raising           |
|                                   |     procedures are to be          |
|                                   |     followed, including           |
|                                   |     consideration of non-recovery |
|                                   |     (for instance, waiver)        |

Reasons an AoS debt cannot be waived

Table 2

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Item                              | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | An AoS debt cannot be waived due  |
|                                   | to administrative error, as       |
|                                   | section1237A of the Social        |
|                                   | Security Act 1991 only applies    |
|                                   | where the payment is received by  |
|                                   | the debtor (assurer). An assurer  |
|                                   | does not receive the payment so   |
|                                   | section 1237A does not apply. For |
|                                   | example:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Where an assuree had received |
|                                   |     an incorrect rate of          |
|                                   |     recoverable payment, due to   |
|                                   |     an administrative error.      |
|                                   |     Although the error was        |
|                                   |     administrative, the payment   |
|                                   |     was made to the assuree       |
|                                   |     rather than the debtor        |
|                                   | -   The debt cannot be waived due |
|                                   |     to administrative error as    |
|                                   |     the assuree is not the debtor |
|                                   |     in the AoS case               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Section 137AAE of the Social      |
|                                   | Security Act 1991 strengthens     |
|                                   | debt recovery provisions by       |
|                                   | imposing extra rules when         |
|                                   | considering the waiver of AoS     |
|                                   | debts. These rules prevents a     |
|                                   | waiver of debt:                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   if the assurer/s claim they   |
|                                   |     were unaware of the           |
|                                   |     obligations of providing an   |
|                                   |     AoS. This is because the      |
|                                   |     potential assurer must attend |
|                                   |     an interview with Services    |
|                                   |     Australia where they will     |
|                                   |     have these obligations        |
|                                   |     explained to them. They must  |
|                                   |     then confirm that they        |
|                                   |     understand these AoS          |
|                                   |     obligations                   |
|                                   | -   amounts which are lower or    |
|                                   |     equal to the bond amount      |
|                                   |     irrespective of whether the   |
|                                   |     AoS was provided by a single  |
|                                   |     assurer or joint assurers     |
|                                   | -   in cases where a joint        |
|                                   |     assurance is provided, unless |
|                                   |     the Services Australia is     |
|                                   |     satisfied that the amount of  |
|                                   |     debt cannot be recovered from |
|                                   |     any or all of the assurers    |
