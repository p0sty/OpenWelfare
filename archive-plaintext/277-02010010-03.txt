|                                   | Examples of this are:             |

|                                   |     pre-condition is now met, or  |
|                                   | -   the annual rate payable under |
|                                   |     a limited agreement was not   |
|                                   |     equal to or greater than the  |

|                                   |     assessment, but it now meets  |
