This document explains how to identify and make suitable referrals to
the CAO.

Role and responsibilities before referral

For CAO assessments, Service Officers must:

assess customers' circumstances, and

tell the customer about any relevant modules and information needed, see
Completing modules and forms

update the relationship status of the customer before the referral

-   for example, link or unlink as needed
    Note: if the referral is part of a new claim, do this outside of the
    claim activity

make sure Private Trust (MOD PT) and/or Private Company (MOD PC),
provided in person or as part of an online claim include the required
documents listed with these modules

support customers in uploading documents

scan relevant documents when provided in person

If AUSTRAC reports were obtained as part of the initial review:

-   refer to the AUSTRAC Access and Disclosure document to make sure
    that they were not used as evidence, and
-   have not been forwarded to the CAO as part of the referral

Identifying when to refer to a CAO

When Service Officers identify the need for a CAO assessment, they must
create a referral or follow the appropriate escalation process.

-   If it is clear the claim is to be rejected, for example basic
    qualification reasons are not met, do not refer the case to the CAO
-   If it is not clear the claim will be rejected, make a referral to
    the CAO
-   If the customer indicates they have been involved in a private trust
    or private company in the last 5 years, a CAO referral is required
-   If the customer indicates they have not been involved in a private
    trust or company in the last 5 years, but their record is linked to
    a private trust or company record, a CAO referral is required to
    update the information

When identifying a CAO assessment as part of a claim, an open new claim
activity must exist and no action is to be taken to finalise the claim
or restore payments until the CAO has finalised their report and
notified the Service Officer accordingly.

Appropriate CAO referrals

See Step 7 in Table 1 on the Process page for appropriate cases to refer
to a CAO.

Completing a referral to a CAO

If the claim is being processed using Process Direct, create the CAO
Referral from More Options within the claim.

If not using Process Direct, run the CAO Referral guided procedure and
select the Assessment Type New Claim for:

-   claims processed outside of Process Direct
-   Low Income Health Care Card (LIC) renewals requiring a CAO
    assessment
-   current customers with new trust/ company involvement

For all other customers, run the CAO Referral guided procedure and
select the Assessment Type 'Reassessment'.

CAO escalations

An escalation to request CAO action may be needed to speed up the
outcome of a CAO assessment or to request CAO intervention. CAO
escalations are made via a Fast Note for:

-   immediate new claim and non-new claim priority processing. For
    example, at risk, customers experiencing vulnerability, experiencing
    family and domestic violence
-   assets hardship initial contact and/or change of circumstance
-   processing specific tasks where CAO intervention is needed

Note: before sending an escalation to a CAO using a Fast Note, make sure
a CAO referral has been made (when needed).

document, forms about complex assessments, Office Locator and the
Complex Assessment intranet page.
