|                                   | in the parent's name. This        |
|                                   | reduced the parent's taxable      |
|                                   | income from $50,000 to $40,000.   |
|                                   | Since separation, the parent has  |
|                                   | ceased the salary-sacrifice       |
|                                   | arrangement with their employer   |
|                                   | opting to receive the money as    |
|                                   | part of their wages instead.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the parent's ATI has not       |
|                                   | changed, the PSI application must |
|                                   | be refused.                       |

|                                   | The additional income amount can  |
|                                   | also be calculated by looking at  |
|                                   | how much additional income the    |
|                                   | parent earned per pay period from |
|                                   | the date the parent began earning |
|                                   | the additional income to the end  |
|                                   | of the financial year in which    |
|                                   | the income was earned.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, Mary's child support |
|                                   | assessment is based on the        |
|                                   | 2012-13 ATI of $30,000. Mary      |
|                                   | started a 2nd job on 1 March 2013 |
|                                   | and is earning an additional      |
|                                   | amount of $100 per week. From 1   |

|                                   | $1,600. The amount of $1,600      |
|                                   | could be considered for exclusion |
|                                   | from the 2012-13 income used in   |
|                                   | the assessment.                   |

|                                   | can make an application to        |
|                                   | exclude PSI if they are currently |
|                                   | earning additional income. This   |
|                                   | is because the additional income  |
|                                   | is already being used in the      |
|                                   | assessment.                       |

|                                   | to exclude PSI. For their         |
|                                   | estimate to be accepted, it must  |
|                                   | be at least 15% less than the     |
|                                   | already-reduced ATI being used in |
|                                   | their assessment. Once their      |
|                                   | estimate has been accepted, the   |
|                                   | parent may then apply again for   |
|                                   | post-separation income to be      |
|                                   | excluded, but their new ATI       |
|                                   | (provided in their estimate) must |
|                                   | be more than they were earning    |
|                                   | prior to separation. This means   |
|                                   | it is unlikely that an            |

|                                   | pre separation income of $40,000  |
|                                   | (ITD 2014-15) increasing to       |

|                                   | excluded was $10,000. The parent  |
|                                   | advised they changed their work   |
