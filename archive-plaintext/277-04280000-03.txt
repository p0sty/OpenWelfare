|                                   | -   it makes paying child support |
|                                   |     easy and convenient, and      |
|                                   | -   reduces the risk of accruing  |
|                                   |     a child support debt          |

|                                   | Centrelink, but some employers    |
|                                   | may elect to administer the       |
|                                   | entitlement instead. Child        |
|                                   | Support can request deductions    |
|                                   | from this entitlement regardless  |
|                                   | of who is administering it.       |

|                                   | If payers do not want to use EW,  |
|                                   | they must make an election for    |
|                                   | salary deductions not to apply.   |
|                                   | If the election for EW not to     |
|                                   | apply is accepted, explain that   |
|                                   | failure to make payments on time  |
|                                   | will result in enforcement action |
|                                   | such as EW, Centrelink deductions |
|                                   | or TRIPs, without further notice. |
