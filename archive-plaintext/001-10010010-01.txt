This document outlines the roles and responsibilities of Employment
Services and ParentsNext Providers in managing compliance with
compulsory requirements and re-engagement following non-compliance.

Negotiating compulsory requirements

Employment Services providers include:

-   Workforce Australia
-   Workforce Australia Online
-   Disability Employment Services
-   ParentsNext providers

These providers work with job seekers to help address barriers to
employment (both vocational and non-vocational) to help them into work.

ParentsNext providers work with parents of young children to ensure they
receive the assistance they need to prepare for employment by the time
their children reach school age.

Providers have responsibility for negotiating Job/Participation Plans
(Job Plans) that set out the job seeker's compulsory requirements in
return for receiving a participation payment, and to assist their return
to work.

Targeted Compliance Framework

Provider's responsibilities to support ongoing job seeker participation
and compliance include:

-   explaining compulsory requirements, ensuring job seekers understand
    what they need to do in return for receiving a participation payment
    and what can happen to their payment if they don't meet compulsory
    requirements
-   negotiating compulsory requirements in Job/Participation Plans that
    comply with legislation and applicable policy
-   ensuring a job seekers compulsory requirements are reasonable, based
    on their individual circumstances and assessed capacity
-   rescheduling appointments or removing requirements if a job seeker
    makes prior contact and provides an acceptable reason why they are
    unable to attend or meet a requirement

Providers have responsibility for monitoring compliance with compulsory
requirements and have delegation for some decisions under Social
Security Law. Their responsibility includes:

-   identifying and recording that an incident has occurred that
    constitutes a mutual obligation failure, work refusal failure or
    unemployment failure
-   identifying and recording whether a valid reason does or does not
    exist for a mutual obligation failure for the purpose of confirming
    or removing a demerit
-   setting and notifying re-engagement requirements for mutual
    obligation failures and work refusal failures, notifying Services
    Australia the deemed date of notification and when conditions have
    been met
-   undertaking a Capability Interview
-   notifying a re-engagement requirement when a Capability Assessment
    is triggered
-   using the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations'
    Employment Services System (ESS) to notify Services Australia that a
    mutual obligation failure, work refusal failure or unemployment
    failure requires assessment of whether a reasonable excuse exists
    for the purpose of determining whether a penalty should be applied

Providers are responsible for notifying the job seeker of:

-   the decision to record a demerit (through ESS, or the job seeker
    Dashboard in the Workforce Australia website/app)
-   the action required to have a suspension lifted (re-engagement
    requirement), including the requirement to contact Services
    Australia for a Capability Assessment

Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Community Development Program (CDP) provider's responsibilities to
support ongoing participation and compliance include:

-   explaining compulsory requirements, ensuring CDP participant’s
    understand what they need to do in return for receiving a
    participation payment and what can happen to their payment if they
    do not meet compulsory requirements
-   negotiating compulsory requirements in Job Plans that comply with
    legislation and applicable policy
-   ensuring a CDP participant’s compulsory requirements are reasonable,
    based on their individual circumstances and assessed capacity
-   recording attendance at appointments and with other requirements
-   rescheduling appointments/requirements if a CDP participant makes
    prior contact and provides an acceptable reason why they are unable
    to attend

CDP providers have responsibility for monitoring compliance with
compulsory requirements and have delegation for some decisions under
Social Security Law. CDP providers:

electronically advise Services Australia through the Employment Services
System (ESS) that a participation payment is not payable as a result of
non-attendance at a compulsory appointment

initiate and action Non-Attendance Reports (NAR), including booking
re-engagement appointments, notifying CDP participants of the
reconnection requirement and sending an electronic transmission to lift
payment suspensions resulting from a NAR

discuss non-attendance with CDP participants prior to submitting a
Provider Appointment Report (PAR)

will provide Services Australia with all necessary information in
relation to a non-compliance event where a decision is made to pursue
compliance action via a PAR or Participation Report (PR)

are required to ensure that they have availability to deliver any:

-   re-engagement appointments, and
-   waiver re-engagement appointments for the purpose of waiving all or
    part of a serious failure penalty

may also manually request a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)
where they suspect a CDP participant may have barriers to compliance but
has not yet disclosed these to their provider

use the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' Employment
Services System (ESS) to notify Services Australia that a Unemployment
Non-Payment Period (UNPP) or connection, non-attendance, reconnection,
No Show, No Pay, or serious failure requires investigation

CDP providers are responsible for notifying the CDP participant:

-   that their participation payment has stopped due to a missed
    appointment
-   of the action required to restart their payment (reconnection
    requirement)

CDP providers are responsible for notifying Services Australia:

-   if they wish to withdraw compliance action
-   if a participant fails to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment
