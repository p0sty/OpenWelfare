|                                   | Miko is 32 years of age and an    |
|                                   | Australian citizen who has been   |
|                                   | serving a 12 month sentence in    |
|                                   | prison. Whilst in prison, Miko    |
|                                   | commenced an approved full-time   |
|                                   | course studying via distance      |
|                                   | education from 29 August 2016. On |

|                                   | Austudy claim. The claim and      |
|                                   | supporting documents confirm that |

|                                   | Miko's LAWP start date is 29      |

|                                   | However, as Miko was in prison,   |

Impact of coronavirus (COVID-19)

From 25 March 2020 to 24 September 2020 inclusive, new claims had the
LAWP automatically waived.

This included:

-   new claims
-   customers who were serving a LAWP (for example, their waiting period
    ended on 30 May 2020). The LAWP was manually waived from the date
    the waiting period started
-   customers who served their waiting period and started to receive
    payment (for example, their waiting period ended on 26 March 2020)

Customers did not need to show financial hardship for these waiting
periods to be waived.

The Liquid Asset Waiting Period (LAWP) was reinstated from 25 September
2020. The system will continue to automatically waive the LAWP where it
is determined to be appropriate. This includes where claims have been
backdated to start before 25 September 2020.

If the claim was backdated to before 25 September 2020, then the LAWP
was continue to be waived due to COVID-19.

If the claim is being backdated to before 25 September, code a manual
claim date on the Start Date Calculator (NDC) screen that equals the
start date.

This will make sure the LAWP is correctly waived.
