Hub.

About Business Hub

Business Hub is a secure online service for registered businesses and
third party organisations (TPOs). Users can log on and connect to a
range of services offered by the agency.

Businesses that work with the agency will need access to Business Hub to
access online services. These services include:

-   Paid Parental Leave Scheme
-   Nominee Organisation Online Services
-   Group Payment Schedules
-   Cape York Welfare Quarantining Services
-   Employment Separation Certificate Services
-   Customer Information Release service

Development of other services in Business Hub is ongoing.

The agency will notify businesses about the transition from CBOS to
Business Hub. CBOS will stay active until all services have migrated to
Business Hub.

Over time it is intended that Business Hub will replace CBOS.

The Resources page contains links to Services Australia website and
Intranet.
