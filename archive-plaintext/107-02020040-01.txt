This document outlines how to manually create debt records on the Debt
Management and Information System (DMIS).

Reassess the customer's record

Reassess a customer's record to create a debt where possible. This
maintains system integrity.

Create a manual debt where reassessments do not create an undetermined
debt.

Account Payable letter

Before issuing any debt notice, refer to Safeguarding customer privacy
when raising and recovering debts. Issue an Account Payable letter to a
customer when a debt is determined.

Non Debt Program or Payment Assurance Operations staff

Where the system fails to automatically generate a debt shell, create an
ACTDOC to advise DebtDebt staff to manually create a new debt record.

In Customer First:

use Fast Note - select Auto Text, use Debts > Debt Raising > Debt
Raising ACTion DOC Request

include the following in the ACTDOC:

-   reasons a debt should be raised, and
-   information viewed when completing the activity which may result in
    a debt

Note: check when a manual debt is raised for an income support payment.
This may affect FTB. Any FTB debt will need to be investigated and
raised if appropriate.
