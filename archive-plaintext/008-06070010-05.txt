| 1                                 | When an ESAt is upgraded to a JCA |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe attends an ESAt interview     |
|                                   | after having supplied a medical   |
|                                   | certificate to Services Australia |
|                                   | for a bad back. Joe has a history |
|                                   | (over 18 months) of supplying     |
|                                   | medical certificates on and off   |
|                                   | for a back condition. The medical |
|                                   | certificate states it is a        |
|                                   | temporary exacerbation of a       |
|                                   | condition where the duration of   |
|                                   | functional impact is expected to  |
|                                   | be 24 months or more and the      |
|                                   | symptoms include generalised      |
|                                   | lower back pain, referred pain to |
|                                   | legs, and an inability to sit or  |
|                                   | stand for more than 10 minutes.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe gets up and down from the     |
|                                   | chair to stretch and change       |
|                                   | positions regularly throughout    |
|                                   | the assessment. Treatment is      |
|                                   | indicated to be non-steroidal     |
|                                   | anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), |
|                                   | physiotherapy and exercise. Joe   |
|                                   | is also a little overweight. The  |
|                                   | doctor indicates on the           |
|                                   | certificate that Joe cannot       |
|                                   | undertake usual work or study,    |
|                                   | nor do more than 8 hours of work  |
|                                   | per week.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe tells the Assessor the back   |
|                                   | problems have been an issue since |
|                                   | a fall at work 5 years ago, but   |
|                                   | in the last couple of years it    |
|                                   | has become worse. Joe says        |
|                                   | surgery is possible, but there is |
|                                   | just as much chance it will do    |
|                                   | damage as there is it will        |
|                                   | improve, so Joe's not keen to     |
|                                   | pursue it. Joe says that even     |
|                                   | when not suffering a 'relapse'    |
|                                   | the back problems affects         |
|                                   | everything.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Joe's history of medical          |
|                                   | certificates along with verbal    |
|                                   | history, current medical          |
|                                   | evidence, presentation at         |
|                                   | interview, and indication the     |
|                                   | only treatment option may not be  |
|                                   | effective, means it is likely the |
|                                   | situation will affect Joe's       |
|                                   | ability to work into the future   |
|                                   | and will in fact deteriorate.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, an upgrade to a JCA    |
|                                   | and the impact of the condition   |
|                                   | assessed against the Impairment   |
|                                   | Tables would be appropriate. In   |
|                                   | this case where medical           |
|                                   | certificates are the only         |
|                                   | evidence, contact with Joe's      |
|                                   | treating doctor would be needed.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: before a claim for DSP can  |
|                                   | be granted, a Disability Medical  |
|                                   | Assessment (DMA) is required      |
|                                   | unless the customer is manifestly |
|                                   | medically eligible.               |
