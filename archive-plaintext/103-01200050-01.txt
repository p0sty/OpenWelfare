This document outlines how to conduct an Initial Assessment interview to
place a customer on Income Management, under the Supporting People at
Risk (SPaR) measure.

Initial Assessment interview

An Initial Assessment interview is required to place a customer on SPaR
Income Management. The interview:

-   explains how Income Management works
-   determines how their income managed funds can be best used to meet
    the priority needs of the customer and their family, and
-   provides information about other services which may assist them,
    including Centrepay

The interview is held face-to-face or over the phone. This is conducted
with the customer and if applicable, their partner or payment nominee.
The SPaR contact person may wish to attend the Initial Assessment
interview with the customer. The customer must give their permission for
the contact person to attend. If permission is not given, the Income
Management Contact Officer (IMCO) will advise the SPaR contact person.

Failure to attend interview

If a customer does not attend an Initial Assessment interview within
their Income Management engagement period, Income Management will be
automatically applied to their payments.

If a customer still does not attend an Initial Assessment interview 28
days after Auto Income Management commences, their payments may be
suspended.

Preparing for an Initial Assessment interview

To prepare for an Initial Assessment interview, Service Officers should:

Check whether the customer requires an interpreter, and book interpreter
if required

Check whether the customer has an excluded payment nominee for Income
Management purposes:

-   If the customer does not have an excluded payment nominee, the
    customer is eligible for Income Management. However, the payment
    nominee must attend the Initial Assessment interview as they are
    responsible for managing the customer's payments
-   If the customer is a payment nominee for another person, that
    person's payments will also be income managed

Check the record for any vulnerability indicators

Check the customer's current rate of payment and any regular income

Check whether the customer has any current Centrepay deductions or Rent
Deduction Scheme payments

Have relevant Income Management and self-service communication products
available for the customer
