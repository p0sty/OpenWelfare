|                                   | Centrepay is voluntary and the    |

|                                   | deduction at any time. If the     |

|                                   | Centrepay business?               |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | other payment options available   |
|                                   | for their Services Australia      |
|                                   | customers to use. Centrepay is    |
|                                   | voluntary and it is the           |
|                                   | customer's choice to use the      |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | Question: Does the Centrepay      |
|                                   | business need the customer's      |
|                                   | consent before they make a change |
|                                   | to a deduction or restart a       |
|                                   | deduction?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes, a business will need |
|                                   | the consent of the customer to    |
|                                   | start a new deduction, restart a  |
|                                   | cancelled deduction, or to        |
|                                   | increase either the target or the |
|                                   | deduction amount. The business    |
|                                   | must get consent from each        |
|                                   | customer via a Centrepay          |
|                                   | Deduction Authority before these  |
|                                   | changes are made.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a Centrepay deduction is       |
|                                   | cancelled by the customer, this   |
|                                   | is evidence the customer has      |
|                                   | withdrawn their consent. No       |
|                                   | cancelled Centrepay deduction can |
|                                   | be reinstated until new consent   |
|                                   | is obtained from the customer via |
|                                   | a Deduction Authority.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Businesses do not require the     |
|                                   | customer's consent to suspend,    |
|                                   | cancel, reduce, or to add end     |
|                                   | dates to the customer's           |
|                                   | deduction, as this is acting in   |
|                                   | the customer's best interests.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: Does the customer need  |
|                                   | the consent of the business       |
|                                   | before they start a deduction or  |
|                                   | make a change to an existing      |
|                                   | deduction?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No, Centrepay is a        |
|                                   | voluntary service. Customers do   |
|                                   | not need to obtain the consent of |
|                                   | the business before starting,     |
|                                   | cancelling or varying a           |
|                                   | deduction. However, if the        |
|                                   | customer cancels a deduction and  |
|                                   | monies are still owed to the      |
|                                   | business for goods or services,   |
|                                   | it is advisable the customer      |
|                                   | makes alternate arrangements to   |
|                                   | pay the business.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Some deductions, such as court    |
|                                   | fines and court infringements     |
|                                   | cannot be started or changed by   |
|                                   | the customer. Customers will need |
|                                   | to contact the business.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Question: What does the customer  |
|                                   | need to do if an overpayment has  |
|                                   | occurred?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: See Centrepay deduction   |
|                                   | is not received or is incorrect   |
|                                   | and Centrepay overpayment         |
|                                   | recovery.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 6                                 | Question: What will happen if the |
|                                   | customer has outstanding amounts  |
|                                   | owed to the business due to       |
|                                   | cancelled, suspended or reduced   |
|                                   | deductions?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The agency is not         |
|                                   | responsible for any outstanding   |
|                                   | amounts that might be owed. The   |
|                                   | customer will need to speak to    |
|                                   | the business to make alternative  |
|                                   | payment arrangements for the      |
|                                   | amounts owed.                     |

| 7                                 | Question: Is it true that some    |
|                                   | Centrepay businesses cannot have  |
|                                   | current deductions increased, or  |
|                                   | have new deductions started?      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Depending on the          |
|                                   | situation, this may be true. For  |
|                                   | example, if a business is         |
|                                   | suspended or additional           |

|                                   | required to keep personal         |
|                                   | information of Centrepay          |

|                                   | Answer: Businesses must securely  |
|                                   | store all information they        |
|                                   | receive from the agency and       |
|                                   | comply with all privacy laws.     |
|                                   | Deduction Authorities must be     |
|                                   | retained by the business for a    |
|                                   | period of 2 years after the last  |

|                                   | The business is responsible for   |
|                                   | keeping up to date with any       |

|                                   | Centrepay after an update to the  |
|                                   | Policy and Terms, the business is |
|                                   | considered to have agreed to the  |

| 8                                 | Question: Why can't Centrepay be  |
|                                   | used to pay for unregulated       |
|                                   | consumer leases?                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In keeping with the objective of  |
|                                   | Centrepay, it has been decided    |
|                                   | that unregulated consumer leases, |
|                                   | those that run for an indefinite  |
|                                   | period of time or short term      |
|                                   | (less than 4 months) leases, are  |
|                                   | excluded from Centrepay due to    |
|                                   | the low levels of protection      |
|                                   | available to consumers. All       |
|                                   | unregulated consumer lease        |
|                                   | deductions through Centrepay were |
|                                   | cancelled from 17 February 2017   |
|                                   | and cannot be restarted.          |
