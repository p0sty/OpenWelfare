The following payments are included for the purpose of calculating
adjusted taxable income (ATI):

-   Carer Payment (CP) where both the carer and the person being cared

    Pension age (including youth disability supplement when paid with

    From 1 January 2022, DFISA ceased. Where a DFISA payment is made
    retrospectively for a period prior to 1 January 2022, it would be
    counted as adjusted taxable income against the income year for which
    it was received

-   Compensation for permanent impairment paid under the MRCA by DVA

    compensation payment for impairment from another service injury or
    disease

    and lump sums paid by DVA under 234(1)(b) of the MRCA, would be
    included in the widow's estimate of adjusted taxable income in the
    year in which it is paid. Compensation payments made under paragraph
    234(1)(a) of the MRCA (the wholly dependent partner death benefit)
    to an eligible widow, will be disregarded for FTB income assessment
    and Parental Income Test purposes
-   Compensation payments made under both sections 252 and 254 of the
    MRCA to children of a widow

Payments made by Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission

These payments are made by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) and
can be paid as fortnightly instalments or as a lump sum. Arrears and
lump sums are deemed to be income in the tax year they are received. The
Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission can make payments
under 2 Acts:

-   Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act (MRCA)
-   Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA)

Only certain MRCA payments are included as part of the customer's ATI or
the Parental Income Test.

If a widow receives the DVA Income Support Supplement, they would be
completely exempt from the FTB Part A Income Test and the Parental
Income Test.
