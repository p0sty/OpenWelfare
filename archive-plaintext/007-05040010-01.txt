PPL details for customers with children born or entering care both
before and on or after 1 July 2023.

This document outlines the change of circumstances process that applies
to employers who have registered to provide Parental Leave Pay (PPL) to
an employee.

Employer advises of a change

Employers can advise up to 30 days in advance of an:

-   employee resignation/termination of employment
-   return to work - including for an allowable exception reason for PPL
    claims for children born or adopted before 1 July 2023
-   working on a PPL day - for children born or adopted on or after 1
    July 2023

Note: where:

-   PPL has been determined to be delivered by the employer, and the
    employer notifies an employee was working on a PPL day,
-   the employer determination will end and Services Australia will
    deliver any remaining PPL days

This will occur even when the customer notified they worked on a weekend
day within the employer paid period. The employer paid period is only
paid for weekdays (Monday to Friday). See Delivery of Parental Leave
Pay.

Once the assessment of the employees PPL claim is complete employers can
notify a change in circumstances via:

-   Centrelink Business Online Services (CBOS) or
-   Business Hub, or
-   If they are not registered, the Paid Parental Leave Employer
    Processing Team (PPLEPT)

If the employer notifies a change of circumstance, contact the employee
before taking any action.
