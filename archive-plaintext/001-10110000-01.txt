This document outlines information about the policy and procedures used
to decide if a CDP job seeker has been persistently non-compliant with
mutual obligation requirements.

Persistent non-compliance by CDP job seeker

CDP job seekers in receipt of a participation payment are required to
comply with mutual obligation requirements as a condition of their
payment.

When a CDP job seeker repeatedly fails to comply with requirements, a
more serious penalty may apply. Serious failures for persistent
non-compliance are intended to act as a deterrent for patterns of
behaviour that result in a CDP job seeker not making the most of their
opportunities to find work.

Serious failures

A serious failure is applied when the CDP job seeker's non-compliance
over the Serious Failure assessment period has been determined as
'persistent'. This involves the decision maker considering both the
pattern of non-compliance and the appropriateness of the CDP job
seeker's mutual obligation requirements. When there are 3 applied
failures over the Serious Failure assessment period, and the CDP job
seeker's requirements were assessed as appropriate according to their
capacity and any other relevant circumstances, the non-compliance will
generally be deemed 'persistent' and a serious failure will be applied.

Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA)

Before making a determination on a serious failure for persistent
non-compliance, a Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA) must be
undertaken by a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-CCA Specialist.

After a CCA has been conducted, a PST-skilled Service Officer with a
WNPPD security resource is responsible for making a determination
whether or not to apply a serious failure as a result of persistent
non-compliance.

While a pattern of repeated non-compliance may indicate persistent
non-compliance, it may also be an indication:

-   the CDP job seeker may be having difficulty complying with their
    mutual obligation requirements
-   the requirements may be unreasonable and/or unrealistic given the
    CDP job seeker's current circumstances
-   the CDP job seeker may have significant barriers to participation
    which were not previously disclosed or the potential impact of
    previously identified circumstances may have not been understood
    and/or considered

The CCA ensures a CDP job seeker's personal factors and/or circumstances
that affected their capacity to comply are appropriately considered
before making the decision to apply a serious failure

The CCA Report forms part of the evidence base used by a PST-skilled
Service Officer (WNPPD) to determine if the CDP job seeker has
demonstrated persistent non-compliance. Information on the CDP job
seeker's record, including previous failure investigations and
information provided by the CDP job seeker's provider, also forms part
of the evidence for this decision.

When considering whether the CDP job seeker's non-compliance was
persistent, consideration must be given to whether the CDP job seeker
has displayed a pattern of sustained non-compliance that was
intentional, reckless or negligent in nature throughout the CCA
assessment period.

Persistent non-compliance

An assessment of 'persistent' non-compliance should take into
consideration:

-   the CDP job seeker's overall compliance record over the period that
    is, all non-compliance should be considered including valid
    Non-Attendance Reports (NARs) submitted with or without a
    Participation Appointment Report (PAR)
-   whether the overall compliance record demonstrates a pattern of
    persistent non-compliance
-   the extent to which the CDP job seeker has otherwise complied with
    their requirements during the assessment period
-   only applied failures or non-compliance events that were within the
    CDP job seeker's control, that is, the delegate is satisfied the
    failures or events were committed intentionally, recklessly and
    negligently
-   only failures or non-compliance events when the CDP job seeker's
    mutual obligation requirements are reasonable and the appropriate
    notification has been given, and
-   the CDP job seeker's most recent compliance history which may serve
    to demonstrate a genuine willingness to change earlier behaviours

The term 'persistent' has its ordinary meaning that is, persistence
would be indicated by deliberate and continued non-compliance despite
repeated warnings from their CDP Provider and/or the Participation
Solutions Team (PST). This does not mean the non-compliance needs to be
total: a CDP job seeker may be found to be persistently non-compliant
even though they have met some of their mutual obligation requirements
over the period, however:

-   if the CDP job seeker's record indicates they are genuine in their
    efforts to find work, despite instances of non-compliance, the
    decision maker may find the pattern of non-compliance was not
    persistent
-   when consecutive failures have triggered a CCA, this may not always
    provide sufficient evidence of persistent non-compliance, for
    example, if it was the CDP job seeker's first CCA and it was clear
    there had been no opportunity for reinforcing obligations and
    potential consequences of repeated non-compliance with the CDP job
    seeker before the CCA was triggered

Serious Failure assessment period

While all non-compliance over the Serious Failure assessment period
should be considered, a serious failure may only be applied when there
have been 3 applied (connection, non-attendance, reconnection failures
or 3 applied No Show, No Pay failures within the Serious Failure
assessment period.

In determining the 3 applied failures, the incident date of the failure
events are used.

Ongoing payability while a serious failure is being investigated

When a serious failure for persistent non-compliance is under
investigation, CDP job seekers are expected to continue meeting their
mutual obligation requirements.

Note: when a Services Australia CCA has been manually generated
(excluding manually triggered automatic CCAs) to assess the impacts of
suspected barriers to compliance, it may sometimes be appropriate to
explore a temporary exemption from their mutual obligation requirements
until the CCA outcome is known.

When a CCA is generated this ends any outstanding reconnection
requirements. Attendance at the CCA is a compulsory requirement,
non-attendance at a CCA is managed by suspension of payment.

When the outcome of a serious failure for persistent non-compliance is
pending, no further failures can be applied, excluding:

-   connection/reconnection failures relating to non-attendance at a CCA
    appointment
-   a UNPP
-   a serious failure for refusing a suitable job offer

Making a decision not to apply a serious failure

A serious failure is not applied when:

-   there is not the required number of applied failures during the
    Serious Failure assessment period
-   the CDP job seeker's non-compliance was not found to have been
    persistent
-   a participation payment was not payable for the instalment period in
    which the decision to apply the serious failure is made

Outstanding Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) referral

When the Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer
(WNPPD) considers there is sufficient evidence of persistent
non-compliance and an ESAt is outstanding, the serious failure
determination must be held pending the outcome of the ESAt. This is to
ensure the ESAt findings, which may provide evidence regarding the
impacts of issues and barriers, are considered when determining whether
the non-compliance was wilful, reckless or intentional.

Section 42NC

When a decision is made to apply a serious failure the CDP job seeker
enters a serious failure period. For a serious failure period to apply
to a persistently non-compliant CDP job seeker, Section 42NC of the
Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 must also be determined.

This section applies when:

-   the CDP job seeker has the capacity to undertake a serious failure
    requirement, that is, attend a waiver re-engagement appointment with
    their provider
-   the CDP job seeker does not have the ability to undertake a serious
    failure requirement but serving the non-payment period would not
    cause them to be in severe financial hardship

When Section 42NC applies, the serious failure period cannot be waived
due to hardship at the time of the decision and a participation payment
is not payable to the CDP job seeker during the serious failure period
unless the CDP job seeker elects to attend a waiver re-engagement
appointment.

When Section 42NC does not apply, the serious failure period should be
waived under hardship provisions.

Roles and responsibilities

The process undertaken for determining whether a CDP job seeker has been
persistently non-compliant, consists of a 3 stage process:

Preparation for a CCA

Conducting a CCA Specialist Assessment, including

-   developing a CCA Report, and
-   finalisation of the serious failure determination

PST-skilled Service Officer responsibilities

Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers are
responsible for:

-   generating a CCA
-   undertaking brief preparatory work
-   informing the CDP job seeker of the intent of the CCA
-   referring the CDP job seeker to the appropriate CCA Specialist
-   appropriately notifying the CDP job seeker of the requirement to
    attend the CCA and consequences of non-attendance or failing to
    contact if unable to attend

CCA Specialist responsibilities

The CCA Specialist is responsible for determining the extent to which a
CDP job seeker's circumstances may have impacted their ability to comply
with the requirements which were not met over the Serious Failure
assessment period. A CCA is designed to ensure known barriers and/or
previously unidentified barriers are considered in the assessment of
'deliberate' or 'negligent' non-compliance when determining whether the
non-compliance is 'persistent'. The CCA specialist will:

-   interview the CDP job seeker to explore the reasons for
    non-compliance
-   consider whether the current Job Plan is appropriate
-   assess the CDP job seeker's capacity to comply with their mutual
    obligations requirements
-   identify whether the CDP job seeker would benefit from additional or
    alternative interventions to give them the best chance of complying
    with requirements in the future, and recording the outcomes of these
    interventions
-   consider if contact with the CDP job seeker's provider is required
    and when contact occurs, recording the outcome of this contact

PST-skilled Service Officer (WNPPD) responsibilities

Following the CCA, a Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service
Officer (WNPPD) is responsible for determining whether persistent
non-compliance has occurred. This involves:

-   considering the pattern of non-compliance over the serious failure
    assessment period and the CCA report
-   making a determination on whether the non-compliance over the period
    was deliberate and/or negligent and persistent
-   applying a serious failure if appropriate and discussing any waiver
    or hardship provisions with the CDP job seeker
-   implementing any relevant Services Australia interventions, for
    example, exemption from mutual obligation requirements or payment
    reviews, and
-   if possible providing the CDP job seeker with an explanation of the
    decision and their review and appeal rights
