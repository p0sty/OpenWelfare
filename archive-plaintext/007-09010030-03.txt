|                                   | If an employer is using Microsoft |
|                                   | Excel, it is important they       |
|                                   | ensure the date format is set as  |
|                                   | ddmmyyyy before downloading and   |
|                                   | saving the CSV file into          |
|                                   | Microsoft Excel. The date format  |
|                                   | ddmmyyyy is compatible with the   |
|                                   | CSV file date format. If the date |
|                                   | format is not set as ddmmyyyy     |
|                                   | when the CSV file is downloaded   |
|                                   | and saved in Microsoft Excel, the |
|                                   | leading 0 from the date value may |
|                                   | drop off, resulting in the date   |
|                                   | format displayed as dmmyyyy.      |
|                                   | Employers can fix this by         |
|                                   | changing the date format settings |
|                                   | in their Microsoft Excel          |
|                                   | spreadsheet to ddmmyyyy.          |

|                                   | Microsoft Excel, employers can    |
|                                   | download and open the CSV file in |
|                                   | Notepad or WordPad. Both will     |
|                                   | maintain the correct CSV file     |
|                                   | date format of ddmmyyyy.          |
