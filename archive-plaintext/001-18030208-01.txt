This document outlines the policy and procedures about making a decision
when a job seeker who is managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework
commits a mutual obligation failure.

Mutual obligation failures

Compulsory requirements are designed to ensure that job seekers,
including ParentsNext participants, receiving a participation payment
are actively looking for work and/or participating in activities that
will help them into employment.

A mutual obligation failure is committed when a job seeker or
ParentsNext participant who is receiving a participation payment fails
to:

-   enter into a Job/Participation Plan
-   meet their monthly points target (for Workforce Australia
    participants only)
-   attend, or be punctual for a compulsory appointment
-   participate in a compulsory activity
-   undertake adequate job search efforts or meet other job search
    related requirements included in their Job/Participation Plan (for
    Workforce Australia, job search is included in their monthly points
    target requirement)
-   undertake any other activities outlined in their Job/Participation
    Plan
-   act in an appropriate manner during an appointment or while
    participating in a compulsory activity
-   attend a job interview, or behaves inappropriately at an interview
-   act on a job opportunity when requested to do so by their employment
    services provider
-   record that they have complied with a compulsory requirement (for
    job seekers with digital literacy limitations, this will need to be
    done in collaboration with their Provider)

Note: a mutual obligation failure may be committed for failing to comply
with a compulsory requirement scheduled on a weekend.

Consequences of a mutual obligation failure

Green or warning zone

If the provider records that the job seeker does not have a valid reason
for not complying with a compulsory requirement a demerit will be
applied if the job seeker is in the green zone or warning zone.

Five mutual obligation failures within 6 active months generally
indicate persistent non-compliance. After 5 demerits, job seekers enter
the financial penalty zone if both a Capability Interview and Capability
Assessment have found that the job seeker is capable of meeting their
requirements.

Note: job seekers may enter the financial penalty zone more quickly if
they fail to attend a job interview, fail to act on a job opportunity or
act in a manner such that employment would not be offered to them. This
recognises the seriousness of these types of mutual obligation failures.

Penalty zone

If the provider records that the job seeker does not have a valid reason
for not complying with a compulsory requirement a Non-compliance Report
(NCR) will be submitted to Services Australia if the job seeker is in
the penalty zone.

Financial penalties apply where a job seeker, including a ParentsNext
participant, has persistently committed mutual obligation failures
without reasonable excuse.

A penalty count is used to determine the applicable financial penalty.
The penalty is calculated based on the penalties which have already been
applied in the same failure group:

-   first financial penalty results in a 50% payment reduction for the
    payment period
-   second financial penalty result in a 100% payment reduction for the
    payment period
-   third financial penalty results in payment cancellation and a
    post-cancellation non-payment period

Job seekers can choose to accept the financial penalty for certain
mutual obligation failures without a compliance investigation. These
failures include a first or second failure in the penalty zone for
non-attendance at provider appointments, third party appointments, job
interviews or activities. They can choose to talk to Services Australia
about these failures if they have evidence or information they would
like considered before a financial penalty is applied.

Job seekers always have to talk to Services Australia about failures
that relate to misconduct or if the penalty would result in payment
cancellation.

PST staff conduct a compliance investigation for an active failure.

Job seekers transitioning between job seeker compliance systems

Job seekers will transition between job seeker compliance systems where
they change residential address and either commence in or cease to
participate in the Community Development Program (CDP).

Where job seeker transfers to a CDP provider:

-   outstanding mutual obligation failures may still be investigated and
    a financial penalty applied
-   any non-compliance cancellation due to a mutual obligation failure
    or post-cancellation non-payment period will remain in place
