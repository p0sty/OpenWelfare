Claimant Declaration

"Do you declare that you have incurred the expenses for the services for
which you are claiming and that they are not for the purposes of
superannuation or provident account schemes, admission to a friendly
society, life insurance, mass immunisation, or health screening and are
not connected with the patient's employment?

Do you declare that the services were not provided by or on behalf of
the Australian Government, a state, territory or a local governing body
or an authority established by a law of the Australian Government, a
state or territory?

Do you declare that you have not claimed for dental expenses through
private health insurance?

You are aware that the Agency’s Privacy notice is available on our
