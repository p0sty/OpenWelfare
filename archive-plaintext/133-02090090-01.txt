This document outlines how to help customers having trouble accessing
and using their Medicare online account and the Express Plus Medicare
mobile app.

Troubleshooting by Service Officers

Service Officers provide support to help customers diagnose common
online problems.

Ask the customer questions to identify the problem. Confirm the problem
lies with the online service and whether the customer can fix it. Some
problems can be quickly fixed.

Common problems include:

-   no access to Medicare services via myGov
-   service interruptions
-   internet connection
-   mobile device, internet browser and settings
-   trouble accessing or using a service option

More help

If the Service Officer cannot resolve the issue, they seek help from
Local Peer Support (LPS).

If LPS cannot resolve the issue, they refer it to Level 2 Business
Support by submitting a mySupport request.

The Resources page contains links to the Services Australia website,
intranet pages and internet browser help. It also describes error
messages.
