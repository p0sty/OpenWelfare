This document outlines what to consider when helping customers with
disability or medical condition.

Disabilities and medical conditions

Staff should be aware of the disabilities and medical conditions that
may impact customers including:

-   musculo-skeletal conditions
-   mental health conditions
-   neurological conditions
-   intellectual disabilities
-   Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ acquired immune deficiency
    syndrome (AIDS)
-   acquired brain injury
-   vision loss
-   deaf, have hearing loss or, have a speech disability
-   childhood disabilities
-   common medical conditions for aged customers
-   developmental disorders

Understanding the challenges faced by customers with disability

Many customers with disability or medical conditions face barriers and
challenges in life. Understanding this will ensure that staff can help
and assist customers.

Staff should focus on what people can do, rather than what they cannot
do.

Customers with the same type of disability may have different:

-   functional abilities
-   limitations, and
-   methods of coping

Many customers with disability or medical conditions require little or
no support. Others, may require constant care and attention. They may
also have a nominee acting on their behalf.

Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) and Job Capacity Assessments (JCA)

Employment Services Assessments (ESAt) and Job Capacity Assessments
(JCA) help determine:

-   a customer’s work capacity
-   barriers to participation
-   referrals to appropriate services, and
-   assessment of medical conditions under the Impairment Tables

Role of a Service Officer

Understanding how conditions may affect customers helps staff to:

-   provide assistance, and
-   respond appropriately to any issues that may arise

Staff should be aware of the customer’s:

-   disability
-   medical conditions, and
-   suitable services and assistance that may be offered

Participation needs to be viewed as a positive outcome for the customer.
Encouraging participation and focusing on ability as well as disability
helps support customers who want to stay actively engaged.

Proactive Managed Service Plan (MSP)

A proactive MSP may be set up for customers experiencing vulnerability
or barriers that need extra support to access Services Australia
services.

Discussions about MSPs and servicing strategies with a customer should
be supportive and positive. Customer input and engagement is more likely
to lead to an effective MSP.

If a proactive MSP is appropriate or for more information, see Customer
aggression - Managed Service Plan (MSP) .
