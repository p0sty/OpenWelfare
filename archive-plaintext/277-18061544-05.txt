| 1                                 | Question: Can debts be offset     |
|                                   | from other cases involving the    |
|                                   | children of both parties? + Read  |

|                                   | Answer: Yes - debts from a s143   |
|                                   | order can be offset against debts |
|                                   | arising from cases involving the  |
|                                   | children of both parties. This    |
|                                   | would cover the scenario where a  |
|                                   | s143 order was obtained for one   |
|                                   | child but the case continues for  |
|                                   | other children of the parents.    |

|                                   | Answer: Yes – S72AA of the        |
|                                   | Registration and Collection Act   |
|                                   | 1988 states that deductions can   |
|                                   | be made from the social security  |
|                                   | pensions and benefits of payers   |
|                                   | who have an outstanding debt      |
|                                   | under an overpayment order that   |
|                                   | is registered for collection by   |
|                                   | Child Support.                    |

| 3                                 | Question: Does the s143           |
|                                   | overpayment order need to state   |
|                                   | an amount? + Read more ...        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes – the s143 order must |
|                                   | specify an amount or it must      |
|                                   | specify amounts paid during a     |
|                                   | specific period for it to be      |
|                                   | registered with Child Support and |
|                                   | recovered from the former payee.  |
|                                   | The s143 order could specify 'all |
|                                   | amounts paid for child support'   |
|                                   | which means Child Support would   |
|                                   | have to calculate the amount      |
|                                   | repayable from their records and  |
|                                   | check with the parties to the     |
|                                   | order for any amounts paid        |
|                                   | directly during periods of        |
|                                   | private collect to arrive at the  |
|                                   | amount.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | Question: If the payer has lodged |
|                                   | a s107 with Child Support stating |
|                                   | they are not the parent of the    |
|                                   | child, can Child Support use that |
|                                   | to create the assessment and      |
|                                   | recover the payments? + Read more |
|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No – Child Support need   |
|                                   | the court to make the s107        |
|                                   | declaration that a person is not  |
|                                   | liable to pay child support for   |
|                                   | the child/children and also a     |
|                                   | s143 order which details the      |
|                                   | amount that is to be repaid.      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Question: If the court makes a    |
|                                   | s143 and states that the former   |
|                                   | payee must transfer property to   |
|                                   | the former payer, can Child       |
|                                   | Support register that and enforce |
|                                   | as an order? + Read more ...      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No – the s143 order must  |
|                                   | specifically state an amount of   |
|                                   | money to be repaid or amounts     |
|                                   | paid during a specific period. If |
|                                   | the order is for property, the    |
|                                   | former payer would need to        |
|                                   | enforce that order themselves.    |

|                                   | against a s143 liability, if the  |
|                                   | NAPs were for those items listed  |

|                                   | Answer: No - Section 71C (5) of   |
|                                   | the Registration and Collection   |
|                                   | Act excludes s143 liabilities     |
|                                   | from the prescribed NAPs          |

|                                   | Answer: When completing the       |
|                                   | periodic amount, raise the full   |
|                                   | liability (overpayment) amount    |
|                                   | for 1 day as the periodic amount, |
|                                   | using the frequency as daily and  |
|                                   | the liability to start and finish |
|                                   | on the same day. If the court     |
|                                   | order specifies 'all child        |
|                                   | support payments' are repayable   |
|                                   | (or something similar), calculate |
|                                   | the amount to be paid under the   |
|                                   | s143 order. It will include any   |
|                                   | amounts paid directly during      |
|                                   | periods of private collect.       |
|                                   | Obtain the assessed rate prior to |
|                                   | any s107 being actioned. After    |
|                                   | the s107 is actioned staff will   |
|                                   | not be able to easily obtain the  |
|                                   | assessed rate and will need to    |
|                                   | refer to the case notepads as     |
|                                   | collection information should     |
|                                   | have been recorded when the s107  |
|                                   | was actioned. The parties to the  |
|                                   | s143 order may only recall that   |
|                                   | child support was paid as         |
|                                   | assessed.                         |

| 8                                 | Question: What happens if there   |
|                                   | were periods of private collect   |
|                                   | where the payer paid above the    |
|                                   | assessed rate? + Read more ...    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If the payer paid over    |
|                                   | and above the assessed rate for a |
|                                   | private collect period, Child     |
|                                   | Support would only be able to     |
|                                   | collect the assessed rate.        |
|                                   | Additional amounts paid above the |
|                                   | assessed rate are not strictly    |
|                                   | child support, they would be a    |
|                                   | gift. Both parties will need to   |
|                                   | be contacted first, to confirm    |
|                                   | amounts paid and determine if     |
|                                   | this amount was more than the     |
|                                   | assessed rate.                    |
