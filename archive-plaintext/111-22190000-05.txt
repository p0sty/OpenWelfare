Financial impact of VAP errors

Errors identified in the VAP quality checking can have a financial
impact where a benefit is affected and results in a resubmission or
adjustment. The financial impact can be an under or overpayment.

If the error detected at quality checking results in an under or
overpayment, the difference between the original benefit paid and the
correct benefit paid becomes the amount used to calculate ’financial
impact’, see the example below.

In this example the following details are recorded in the Veterans'
Affairs Processing (VAP) Quality Reporting form:

-   No. of Tran in claim - 6
-   No. of Trans selected for checking - 6
-   No. of Tran in error - 3
-   Trans with Critical Error - 2 (only those with critical errors)

Processing Errors to be recorded - V48 x 1, V61 x 1, V51 x 1, V40 x 1

Note: if the same error is found multiple times within the claim for the
same patient then only one error applies. In the example above for Jenny
there are two dates of service keyed incorrectly for the same patient.
V48 - date of service keyed incorrectly, only applies once. However if
the same error applied with different patients within the same claim,
then the error code would be recorded multiple times.

Error count example 4 - manual claim; multiple critical errors

results in the Veterans' Affairs Processing (VAP) Quality Reporting form
for a manual claim containing a header plus 3 patients.

-   No. of Trans selected for checking - 4
-   No. of Tran in error - 1
-   Trans with Critical Error - 1 (the information keyed in the header
    is an error in the header, not the other vouchers, therefore it is
    one transaction in error)
