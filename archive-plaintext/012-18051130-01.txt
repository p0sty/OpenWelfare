Treatment specifics

A break in treatment cycles is measured:

-   from the date of last approval for PBS-subsidised biological
    medicine treatment in the most recent cycle
-   to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a
    biological medicine under the new treatment cycle

There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles.

See Treatment breaks and failures for full details.

Patient baselines

When a patient qualifies for treatment, they have a measured and defined
level of disease activity:

-   this level becomes the patient’s baseline
-   future applications are measured against the baseline to determine a
    response or failure to current treatment
-   a patient who fails treatment with one agent may wish to use this
    flare of disease to set a new baseline for future treatment to be
    measured against

The baseline measurement for psoriasis is the Psoriasis Area and
Severity Index (PASI).

Note: if a patient is experiencing a flare, this does not always mean a
change of baselines.

PASI

The PASI is a quantitative rating scale that measures the severity of
psoriatic lesions based on the area coverage (as a percentage) and
plaque appearance.

Application forms include the relevant PASI for both groups of patients
to be completed by prescribers

The majority of patients listed on the program are assessed for response
on their whole body PASI

-   Some patients have small patches just affecting the face or hand or
    foot
-   The face/hand/foot assessment is still referred to as a PASI (some
    may only refer to the whole body diagram as a PASI)

Patients can be assessed on either the percentage coverage of the body
as a whole, or the percentage coverage of the affected areas

There are separate restrictions in place for each group of patients
