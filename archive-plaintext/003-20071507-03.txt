CDF returned or review allocated

Table 4 - for activations before February 2022 only. A CDF does not
generate for activations from February 2022

Note: the CDF is not the same as the customer 'self-declaration
statement'. A self-declaration statement is used when the customer is
unable to provide documentary evidence of their income but they meet all
other eligibility requirements. If a self-declaration statement is being
accepted, it must have already been made and recorded on the claim DOC
before the claim is finalised and the CDF issued.

DRA or NZ DRA granted with reporting requirements

Table 10: If old reporting requirements exist on a customer record,
these will occasionally impact the grant of DRA or NZ DRA and
incorrectly place the customer on reporting. The only reporting
requirement for customers on DRA or NZ DRA is the requirement to advise
if their total income exceeds the AWOTE within their 13 week DRA or NZ
DRA entitlement period.
