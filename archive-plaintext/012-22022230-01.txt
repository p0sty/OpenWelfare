Treatment specifics

Complement 5 (C5) inhibitors are defined as eculizumab or ravulizumab.

Patients switching from a C5 inhibitor to pegcetacoplan, for the first
four weeks:

-   pegcetacoplan is administered in addition to the patient’s current
    dose of C5 inhibitor treatment to minimise the risk of haemolysis
    with abrupt treatment discontinuation

After four weeks:

-   the patient should discontinue treatment with the C5 inhibitor
    before continuing on monotherapy with pegcetacoplan
