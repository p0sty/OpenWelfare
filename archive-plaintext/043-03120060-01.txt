This document outlines an overview of assets test assessment of a
partnership business. That is, the amount the customer would receive if
the partnership were wound up.

Value of interest in partnership

The value of a customer's equity in a partnership will depend on:

-   the net value of the partnership assets (calculated using the
    current market value of the assets and liabilities values shown in
    the financial accounts)
-   the proportion of the net assets which the customer is entitled to
    receive
-   the net amounts contributed or withdrawn by the individual partners
-   the wording and intent of the partnership agreement

Supporting documentation

Customers who are involved in partnerships need to provide supporting
documentation to assist the agency in correctly assessing the current
market value of the partnership.

Service Officers and Complex Assessment Officers (CAO) must use the
correct date of event for business income and assets.

The Resources page contains links to the Business Details (MOD F) and
Real Estate (MOD R) forms and information about partner's Capital and
Current Accounts held in a partnership. It also contains information and
examples about partnership property.
