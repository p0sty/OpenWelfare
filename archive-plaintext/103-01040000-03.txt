|                                   | Housing is a basic item.          |

|                                   | aside for housing costs, use the  |
|                                   | following questions as a guide:   |

|                                   | -   How are housing costs         |
|                                   |     currently paid?               |
|                                   | -   How much are the housing      |
|                                   |     costs?                        |

|                                   | Complex living arrangements, and  |
|                                   | the contributions made by         |

|                                   | may need to be taken into account |
|                                   | when making housing payments. For |
|                                   | example, one person may be        |
|                                   | responsible for paying the rent,  |
|                                   | while another pays for the food.  |
|                                   | If a request to pay rent on       |
|                                   | regular basis is above the amount |
|                                   | payable by the customer as        |
|                                   | verified on the Accommodation     |
|                                   | Details (AC) screen, the reason   |
|                                   | for this must be included in any  |
|                                   | Expense Notes or DOC. Other than  |
|                                   | in these complex living           |
|                                   | arrangements, customers cannot    |
|                                   | access more than the amount       |
|                                   | verified on the AC screen. This   |
|                                   | is because it can result in the   |
|                                   | customer accessing income managed |
|                                   | funds as cash.                    |

|                                   |     ensure there are sufficient   |
|                                   |     funds to pay the expense      |

|                                   | -   The AC screen aligns with the |
|                                   |     customer's expense request    |
|                                   | -   If rent is payable to         |
|                                   |     commercial landlords or       |

|                                   |     However, customers should be  |
|                                   |     encouraged to provide         |
|                                   |     verification as soon as       |
|                                   |     possible, (unless they are    |

|                                   | one that the customer previously  |
|                                   | lodged with the store as          |
|                                   | collateral for a cash loan.       |

|                                   | This cash could then be used to   |

|                                   | There are, however, situations    |

|                                   |     would indicate that the       |

|                                   | A lay-by is essentially a         |
|                                   | contract between a customer and a |
|                                   | retailer whereby the customer     |
|                                   | pays for goods over a period of   |
|                                   | time rather than upfront.         |

|                                   | In most lay-by agreements the     |
|                                   | customer will pay an initial      |
|                                   | deposit followed by regular       |
|                                   | payments. The retailer holds the  |
|                                   | goods until the customer has paid |
|                                   | the full price of the goods.      |

|                                   | Service Officers should encourage |
|                                   | the customer to familiarise       |
|                                   | themselves with the lay-by terms  |
