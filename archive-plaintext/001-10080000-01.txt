This document outlines the processes in place to make sure Community
Development Program (CDP) participants re-engage with their provider
after non-attendance at a compulsory appointment with, or arranged, by
their provider.

CDP participant obligations

CDP participants who have mutual obligation requirements are required
to:

-   attend compulsory appointments arranged with or by their provider
-   contact the organisation the appointment is with before the
    scheduled start time if unable to attend and explain why they are
    unable to attend
-   meet other requirements in their Job Plan such as attending job
    interviews and undertaking job search where appropriate
-   accept suitable paid work when it is offered

If a CDP participant does not attend a compulsory appointment or
compulsory requirement in their Job Plan, and has not contacted
beforehand with a suitable reason why they are unable to attend,
compliance action may be initiated.

Automatic suspension of payments

To further reinforce the importance of attending appointments and
remaining engaged, a CDP participant's participation payment may be
automatically suspended when one of the following occurs:

-   a Non-Attendance Report (NAR) is received
-   a connection failure is generated

Where automatic suspension occurs, the date of effect will be the later
of:

-   the start of the instalment period in which the NAR is received or
    failure generated
-   the date paid to plus one (where part payment has already been made
    for the instalment period, for example, where weekly payments are
    made)
-   the date reported plus one where reporting occurred on the same day
    but before receipt of the NAR
-   2 days after a suspension ends where that suspension is due to loss
    of payability (for example, imprisonment or departure overseas) and
    runs for part of the instalment period in which a NAR is received

Non-attendance at an appointment with a CDP provider

A CDP participant's participation payment may be suspended
'Non-Attendance Report Received' (ANR) when a valid Non-Attendance
Report (NAR) is received for non-attendance at a compulsory provider
appointment (including re-engagement appointments).

In most cases, a CDP participant's payment is automatically suspended at
the same time a NAR is accepted unless payment is already suspended for
another reason.

Where payment has already been suspended for another reason:

-   a NAR related suspension is automatically applied once the other
    suspension is lifted
-   a Note/Display on Access (DOA) DOC will automatically be created on
    the CDP participant's record alerting that a NAR is outstanding

The ANR suspension is automatically applied once the other suspension is
lifted.

An ANR suspension may be overwritten by any cancellation, or a
suspension applied from a date before the ANR suspension date of effect.

Payment suspension

A CDP participant's participation payment may be suspended 'Did not
attend compulsory participation appointment' (APA) when a Participation
Report is received from the provider indicating the CDP participant:

-   has failed to attend a compulsory appointment they have arranged for
    the CDP participant with a third party provider, generating a
    connection failure
-   has failed to enter into a Job Plan with their CDP provider,
    generating a connection failure
-   has failed to provide sufficient job search efforts to their CDP
    provider, generating a connection failure

If a CDP participant's payment is not suspended when the failure is
generated, the usual compliance measures will be used to re-engage the
CDP participant and discuss the failure.

If the participant does not accept the reconnection requirement, payment
will remain suspended.

Note: although Non-Attendance Reports (NAR) result in suspension of
payment, and a Provider Appointment Report (PAR) may subsequently result
in a failure investigation, PAR failures have different rules in regards
to their generation and date of effect.

Suspending payment when a reconnection requirement is refused

If a CDP Participant refuses to accept a reconnection requirement, and
their payment is:

-   currently suspended 'Did not attend compulsory participation
    appointment or activity' (APA), the suspension must remain on the
    record
-   not currently suspended, then payment should be manually suspended
    by the Service Officer investigating the failure, see Suspension of
    payments (CLK) for more information

Despite the CDP participant's refusal to re-engage, they should be
notified of the reconnection requirement where possible. This means a
re-engagement appointment must be booked and the CDP participant
notified of the appointment, including the consequences for not
attending. If the CDP participant changes their mind and attends the
appointment booked in the Online Diary, a 'Restore payment' manual
follow up activity will appear on their record to prompt restoration of
their payment.

CDP participant does not attend re-engagement appointment

A CDP participant's participation payment will generally be cancelled
'Customer failed to re-engage' (CDR) if they do not comply with a
reconnection or further reconnection requirement notified by Services
Australia within 29 days of the requirement first being issued.

Where a CDP participant does not attend a re-engagement appointment
notified by their provider, the provider may choose to initiate
compliance action through the submission of a Non-Attendance Report
(NAR), or a NAR and Provider Appointment Report (PAR).

CDP participant does not contact following suspension

Where a suspension 'Did not attend compulsory participation appointment
or activity' (APA) has been applied and the CDP participant does not
contact Services Australia to accept the reconnection requirement, the
suspension will be maintained. Payment will be cancelled automatically
after 13 weeks if not cancelled earlier for another reason.

Where a 'Non-Attendance Report Received' (ANR) suspension has been
applied and the CDP participant does not contact their provider and/or,
attend a re-engagement appointment where required, the suspension will
be maintained until their payment is automatically cancelled DCP (Did
not contact provider to re-engage) after 29 days.

Review of cancellation decisions

If the CDP participant applies for a formal review of a CDR or DCP
cancellation, or it's identified that the cancellation should not have
occurred, the record must be referred to the Participation Solutions
Team (PST). Service Officers outside of the PST are not to restore a
record that has been cancelled CDR or DCP.

PST-skilled Service Officers may be required to restore a record as a
result of a review of decision following a CDR or DCP cancellation where
there is evidence to indicate the CDP participant:

contacted and/or attended a re-engagement appointment however this was
not identified before the CDR or DCP cancellation due to:

-   incorrect or incomplete coding by Services Australia and/or the CDP
    provider, or
-   a system issue or error

was experiencing a major personal crisis and had absolutely no capacity
to comply with any of their mutual obligation requirements in the 29 day
period. For a DCP cancellation to warrant restoration, there would have
to be significant factors that made it unreasonable for the CDP
participant to contact their provider for the duration of the period. If
the CDP participant was able to contact Services Australia, or tried to
report during the period, it is unlikely that restoration should occur

Note: there must be evidence to confirm the original requirement has
been met, or that this evidence must also ensure that despite an update
made by a provider to an Online Diary result, the original requirement
has been met or evidence exists confirming the CDP participant is no
longer required to meet the original requirement.

CDP participant terminates call or call is disconnected

If a CDP participant terminates a call, or the call is disconnected,
before re-engagement can be discussed, the 'Did not attend compulsory
participation appointment or activity' (APA) suspension should remain in
place. Restoration should not occur until reconnection requirements are
discussed and a re-engagement appointment booked where required.

Roles and responsibilities

Where a Non-Attendance Report (NAR) has been submitted the provider is
responsible for re-engaging the CDP participant. Where a CDP participant
contacts, Service Officers are responsible for referring the CDP
participant to:

-   the Participation Solutions Team (PST) for all compliance actions,
    apart from a NAR
-   their provider if there is no compliance action outstanding

Following a 'Did not attend compulsory participation appointment or
activity' (APA) suspension:

A PST-skilled Service Officers with a PFDEC or WNPPD security resource
are responsible for:

-   investigating any compliance action associated with the payment
    suspension and reconnecting CDP participants to their CDP provider
    during the failure investigation, when required
-   manually restoring payment once the CDP participant has accepted the
    reconnection requirement or it is determined they no longer need to
    re-engage
-   manually suspending a CDP participant's payment if they refuse to
    re-engage (where payment is not currently suspended)
