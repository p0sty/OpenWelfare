This document outlines information relating to determination of a
dependent child for inclusion in the family pool for the PIT for Youth
Allowance (YA), ABSTUDY (ABY) and Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)
Scheme Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA). This is for Service Officers
in service centres and Student Smart Centre Processing centres only.

Dependent child determination

The PIT may be applied to the combined parental income of the
parent(s)/guardian(s) of dependent YA, ABSTUDY and AIC Scheme ABA
customers to determine the customer's entitlement.

A child is dependent if:

they are wholly or substantially dependent upon the
parent(s)/guardian(s) - this does not include the parent paying
maintenance for the child, and

they receive (or their parent(s)/guardian(s) qualifies on their behalf)
one of these qualifying payments:

-   YA
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   ABSTUDY Group 2 School Fees (means tested component)
-   AIC Scheme ABA, or
-   be defined as an FTB child or regular care child

Note: the parent(s)/guardian(s) do not need to be receiving FTB or Rent
Assistance (RA).

Parental income in common

A person can be included in the customer's family pool where they are a
dependent and they have a parent in common.

Two or more people are determined to have parental income in common if a
parent of one person is also a parent of the other person and:

-   the PIT applies to each of them, or
-   they are a sibling defined as an FTB child or regular care child

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and regular care children

For FTB and regular care children aged 0-19 to be included in the family
pool, the child must meet the following:

-   recorded as 'in customer care' of the parent(s)/guardian(s)
-   if 16-19 years, recorded as in full-time secondary study
-   an FTB claim has been lodged for each child
-   proof of birth is recorded for each child
-   be alive, or if they have died they are within the FTB bereavement
    period

Note: children 16-19 years who receive ABSTUDY Living Allowance and/or
School Fee Allowance Group 2 and who meet the definition of an FTB child
will have both amounts included in the family pool calculation,

In addition, a regular care child will only be included if rent has been
verified on the parent(s)/guardian(s) record.

If a family intends to claim FTB as a lump sum, the child needs to be
assessed as in care at the time the sibling claims YA, ABSTUDY or the
applicant claims ABA for the AIC student to be included in the family
pool.

If there are no details of the sibling on the parent's record, the
parent should lodge an FTB claim for the details to be assessed and
recorded.

The contribution to the family pool of the FTB or regular care child
will be the maximum notional FTB rate.

Other siblings

Siblings are not included in the customer's family pool and PIT
calculations when they:

-   are not receiving (or claiming) a payment that is subject to the
    PIT, or
-   do not meet the definition of an FTB child, or
-   do not meet the definition of a regular care child or
-   do meet the definition of a regular care child but rent paid by the
    parent has not been coded as verified on the parent(s)/guardian(s)
    record
-   have been granted a payment as an independent person, for example,
    Disability Support Pension (DSP), ABSTUDY or YA

This is the case even if they have the same parent(s)/guardian(s) or
parents as the customer and regardless of the sibling's age or where
they live.

Blended families

There will be situations where the customer and their sibling(s) will
have different people in their family pools. This can occur when:

-   the customer has more than one sibling subject to the PIT
-   at least one of their siblings has only one parent (Parent 1) in
    common with the customer, and
-   at least one of their siblings has only the other parent (Parent 2)
    in common with the customer, and
-   both siblings receive the Away From Home Rate of ABSTUDY or YA and
    have established a permanent home away from the family home
-   an FTB or regular care child has shared care arrangements

Note: a person cannot be in more than three family pools, regardless of
how many siblings are involved. The customer is always assessed based
only on the people in that customer's family pool.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights. If required, record a request
    for an explanation or application for a formal review

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer before finalising the
decision.

The Resources page contains a diagram showing how different siblings can
be in different family pools.
