PPL details for customers with children born or entering care both
before and on or after 1 July 2023.

This procedure outlines the Paid Parental Leave scheme work test for
Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). The work test
for PPL and DAP are very similar, the main difference is how the 13
month work test period is calculated.

Eligibility for PPL for a child born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023

To be eligible for PPL in normal circumstances the claimant must meet
the work test. If a birth mother or an adoptive parent claims, they only
need to meet the work test (or satisfy an exception).

If any other claimant type claims PPL in normal circumstances, e.g.
biological father or partner of birth mother, they need to meet the work
test in addition to the birth mother. A birth mother who meets the work
test requirements will be payable even if the father or partner does
not.

In cases of adoption, the partner of an adoptive parent is not payable
unless an adoptive parent meets the work test requirements. Where there
are two adoptive parents, there will be no requirement for them both to
meet the work test requirements.

To meet the work test a customer must have:

-   performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work for a period
    spanning 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) within the
    392 day work test period (approximately 13 months), and:
-   had no more than a break of 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) between 2
    qualifying work days in the 295 day (approximately 10 months)
    qualifying period

Customers can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between workdays during
the 392 day (about 13 months) work test period. They just cannot have
this gap during their 295 day (about 10 months) qualifying period.

Customers may still be eligible for PPL if they have ceased or intend to
cease working. The PPL work test is based on the customer's employment
information in the 392 day period prior to the birth/entry into care of
their child.

Note: a special claimant in exceptional circumstances are exempt from
the work test.

Eligibility for PPL for a child born or adopted before 1 July 2023

To be eligible for PPL in normal circumstances, primary and secondary
claimants need to meet a work test.

To meet the work test a customer must have:

-   performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work for a period
    spanning 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) within the
    392 day work test period (approximately 13 months), and:
-   had no more than a break of 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) between 2
    qualifying work days in the 295 day (approximately 10 months)
    qualifying period

Note: customers can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between workdays
during the 392 day (about 13 months) work test period. They just cannot
have this gap during their 295 day (about 10 months) qualifying period.

Customers may still be eligible for PPL if they have ceased or intend to
cease working. The PPL work test is based on the customer's employment
information in the 392 day period prior to the birth/entry into care of
their child.

If exceptional circumstances for PPL apply, secondary claimants may be
exempt from the work test. PPL tertiary claimants are also exempt from
the work test.

Note: JobKeeper Payment and COVID-19 Disaster Payments (paid by Services
Australia on or after 3 June 2021) count towards the work test. Other
COVID-19 payments, such as those paid by state or territory governments
and Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, do not count as qualifying work for
the work test.

Eligibility for DAP

DAP can only be claimed for a child born before 1 July 2023.

To be eligible for DAP all customers must meet the work test.

To meet the work test a customer must have:

-   performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work for a period
    spanning 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) within the
    392 day work test period (approximately 13 months), and
-   had no more than a break of 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) between 2
    qualifying work days in the 295 day (approximately 10 months)
    qualifying period

Note: customers can have a gap of more than 12 weeks between workdays
during the 392 day (about 13 months) work test period. They just cannot
have this gap during their 295 day (about 10 months) qualifying period.

Current or continuing employment is not a requirement of the work test.
A customer may be currently unemployed or may be planning to resign from
their employment at the time they lodge their claim, and can still meet
the work test based on their employment during the qualifying period.
The DAP work test is based on the customer's employment information in
the 392 day period before the nominated DAP period start date.

Qualifying work

A customer is considered to have worked on a day when at least one hour
of qualifying work has been performed on that day. Work performed
(whether or not the work was performed in Australia) as an employee,
contractor, self-employment, or any form of gainful activity for reward
or financial gain is considered as qualifying work. A customer can count
work performed during the work test period for multiple employers, such
as a second or previous job.

Paid leave, such as recreational leave and sick leave, counts towards a
claimant's qualifying work. A person is also taken to be on paid leave
if they are on unpaid leave from their employer while receiving workers
compensation, accident compensation or a similar payment.

Previous PPL and/or DAP periods in the 13 months before the birth or
adoption of a second and subsequent child will count as 'qualifying
work' towards the Paid Parental Leave scheme work test. If a customer
includes a previous period of PPL and/or DAP in the work test, a weekday
will count as 7.6 hours.

The Resources page contains examples of the work test period and
qualifying period.

Exceptions

Premature birth

For a child's birth mother, an exception to the work test may be applied
if they are required to:

-   cease employment early, or
-   reduce their hours of employment because their child was delivered
    prematurely

If a DAP customer was expected to meet the work test based on the
nominated DAP period start date but did not meet the work test due to
the child's premature birth:

-   they are determined to have met the work test if, relevant evidence
    has been provided, and
-   it is clear they would have met the work test had the child not been
    born prematurely

Pregnancy related complications or illness

A child's birth mother may meet the work test if they:

-   they have experienced pregnancy related complications or illness
    that prevented them from working, and
-   would have met the work test had the pregnancy related complications
    or illness not occurred, and
-   suitable evidence has been provided

No longer employed

If the customer is no longer employed, for example, business has ceased
trading or their work contract has ceased, the customer may still be
deemed to meet the work test.

A Service Officer must be satisfied that the medical condition prevented
the customer from seeking new employment or extending their contract. To
support this, evidence of a consistent work history showing a strong
connection to the workforce must be provided.

Special Circumstances

Customers who do not meet the work test may qualify for an exception if
they:

-   experienced special circumstances within their work test period, and
-   this affected their ability to perform paid work

An exception to the work test may be applied if:

-   special circumstances existed, and
-   the customer would have met the work test if the special
    circumstances did not exist

The special circumstance exception reasons include:

-   severe medical condition or caring for a close family member who is
    affected by a severe medical condition
-   natural disaster declared by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory,
    and
-   family and domestic violence

For more details about customers experiencing vulnerability, see
Identifying customer vulnerability and risk issues.

Severe medical condition

A customer may meet the work test if:

they were prevented from working during their work test period because
they were:

-   affected by a severe medical condition, or
-   caring for a close family member who was affected by a severe
    medical condition

suitable evidence has been provided

A close family member is the customer's:

-   partner
-   child (natural, adopted or step-child)
-   sibling (natural, adopted or step-sibling)
-   parent (natural, adopted or step-parent)
-   partner's parent (natural, adopted or step-parent)
-   a person the customer has legal guardianship over

For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 'family member'
includes cultural kinship relationships.

Natural disaster

A customer may meet the work test if:

-   they were prevented from working during their work test period
    because they were severely affected by a natural disaster
-   the natural disaster has been declared by the Commonwealth, a State
    or Territory (see the Resources page)
-   suitable evidence has been provided

Note: COVID-19 is not considered a natural disaster for the work test as
it has not been declared a natural disaster by the Commonwealth, a State
or Territory. A more targeted approach was implemented to support
customers affected by COVID-19. These include:

-   the extended work test measure (for children born or adopted between
    22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021), and
-   counting JobKeeper Payment and the COVID-19 Disaster Payment as
    qualifying work

Family and domestic violence

A customer may meet the work test if:

they were prevented from working during their work test period because
they:

-   experienced family and domestic violence, or
-   were dealing with the impacts of family and domestic violence

the circumstances have been assessed by a social worker

suitable evidence has been provided

-   the social worker may assist the customer with evidence for their
    circumstances, but the customer must still provide evidence of their
    employment

Dangerous Jobs Provision

A Dangerous Job provision applies to pregnant customers/birth mothers
who stop work due to a hazard in their workplace that was or is a risk
to their pregnancy.

There are a few recognised professions where it can be confirmed that a
particular job is dangerous to a pregnant person. Currently these
include:

-   boxers
-   jockeys, and
-   mining contractors

While the intent for this provision was aimed at these particular
industries, the provision does not explicitly preclude other
professions. Depending on the claimant's individual work circumstances,
there may be a condition of the customer's work that constitutes a
hazard connected to the work performed.

Customers will still need to meet the work test but can use the day they
stopped work as the last day of their work test period.

Note: a customer may be assessed under the Dangerous Job provision if
they:

-   cease work due to the risk that coronavirus (COVID-19) has on their
    pregnancy, or
-   are unable to be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to a risk to the
    pregnancy

The work test and claiming PPL and DAP for the same child

If a customer has previously been assessed as being eligible for PPL,
including meeting the work test, and subsequently claims DAP for the
same child born or adopted before 1 July 2023, the customer will also be
assessed as meeting the work test for DAP.

This also applies if a DAP customer has been assessed as eligible and
subsequently lodges a PPL claim for the same child.

The Resources page contains:

-   examples of applying the work test including exceptions such as
    pregnancy related complications
-   the 392 day (approximately 13 month) work test period
-   the 295 day (approximately 10 month) qualifying period
-   a link to the Disaster Assist website to confirm the natural
    disaster has been declared, and
-   a link to the Level 2 Policy Helpdesk online query form
