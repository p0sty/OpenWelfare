This document outlines information about automatic and manual rejection
of a compliance action.

Background

The key purpose of the job seeker compliance system is to encourage job
seekers to meet their compulsory requirements and remain engaged with
employment services.

The job seeker compliance system ensures, job seekers who:

-   fail to meet their requirements without a reasonable excuse, are
    appropriately held to account for their actions
-   have a good reason for not meeting their requirements are not
    penalised

All job seeker compliance decisions completed by Services Australia are
evidence-based decisions and apply job seeker compliance policy and
legislation in a consistent way.

All compliance actions will be rejected where:

-   the non-compliance event did not occur, or
-   the non-compliance event is invalid, or
-   reasonable excuse and prior contact requirements (if required) were
    established

Note: Principal Carer Parents (PCP) or job seekers with an assessed
Partial Capacity to Work (PCW), are not required to look for, accept or
remain in work of more than 15 hours per week.

Compliance action automatically rejected

When a non-compliance event is reported, both the Employment Services
System (ESS) and Services Australia system complete a validity check.

This validity check confirms the job seeker or participant was subject
to compulsory requirements:

-   on the non-compliance event date, and
-   at the time the report is received

While a compliance investigation is pending, the Services Australia
system continues to work in the background. When updates are made to the
job seeker's record that mean a compliance investigation is no longer
needed, the system will automatically reject and finalise compliance
action when it can. For example, outstanding compliance investigations
may be automatically finalised by the Services Australia system when:

-   a backdated exemption from compulsory requirements is granted, or
-   the job seeker's payment is suspended due to imprisonment

Making a decision to reject compliance action

Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled staff with WNPPD or PFDEC
security resources and service centre staff with UNPP security
resources, are responsible for job seeker compliance decisions.

Decision makers must be sure any decision to reject a compliance action
is evidence-based and impartial.

Only consider matters relevant to the compliance action during the
investigation. What is relevant will depend on the:

-   type of compliance action, and
-   job seeker's circumstances directly impacting their ability to
    comply when the non-compliance occurred

The Resources page contains links to summaries of current codes for
recording a decision to reject a failure or not apply compliance action.
