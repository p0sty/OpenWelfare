|                                   |     semester one. It confirms the |

Job Plan example

Julie has an employment contract, and an active Job Plan, for nine
months. After receiving ACCS (Transition to Work) for a work activity
for 26 weeks (six months), Julie applies for ACCS (Transition to Work)
for a study activity for 52 weeks.

Julie is required to provide evidence of the study activity, but as
Julie is continuing to work while studying and the Job Plan remains
active, no updates are required to the Job Plan. Julie will have to
update the Job Plan within the next three months before the employment
contract ends or the Job Plan will become inactive.

If the Job Plan expires while Julie is receiving ACCS (Transition to
Work), the ACCS will automatically cancel if a new Job Plan is not
negotiated before the start of Julie’s next CCS fortnight.
