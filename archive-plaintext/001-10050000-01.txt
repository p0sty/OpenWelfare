This document outlines how Service Officers identify and capture a job
seeker's or participant's circumstances that may impact their ability to
meet mutual obligation requirements.

Note: the term 'job seeker' in this file also refers to ParentsNext
(PNX) and Community Development Program (CDP) participants.

Circumstances impacting job seeker compliance

Mutual obligation requirements are designed to ensure job seekers and
participants are actively looking for work and are participating in
activities designed to help them into employment. Importantly mutual
obligation requirements should:

-   be tailored to a job seekers individual circumstances, and
-   be achievable

Job seekers and participants are encouraged to tell their Employment
Services Provider (or the Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC) if they
are a Workforce Australia Online for Individuals) of any circumstances
that may impact their ability to meet their requirements. For example,
job seekers and participants should be encouraged to tell their provider
if they are unable to meet their requirements because they have:

-   caring responsibilities
-   legal (including court ordered) requirements
-   ongoing/chronic medical conditions
-   homelessness concerns or issues

Note: the above list of circumstances is not complete, further
information is available on the Resources page.

This includes encouraging job seekers and participants to record
Personal Events via their Individual Homepage (Workforce Australia job
seekers) or Online Dashboard (DES/ParentsNext Participants) to ensure
their provider is aware of personal appointments/commitments.

Job seekers and participants who tell their provider of their
circumstances will ensure their requirements are appropriately tailored
to their needs. In addition, providers will use information regarding a
job seekers or participants circumstances to:

-   tailor Job Plan requirements to the individuals circumstances
-   determine if a mutual obligation failure or compliance action has
    occurred, and/or
-   determine if Services Australia should investigate a potential
    penalty or failure is applied

Supporting evidence for job seekers circumstances

Staff who identify a job seeker is affected by a circumstance must
record them within the Circumstances Impacting Compliance workflow. The
evidence to support the recording of a circumstance can include:

-   the job seekers statement
-   information available on their record, or
-   a consult with a Specialist Officer (for example, a Social Work
    consult)

During a Capability Assessment (CA), all circumstance must be assessed,
but only the circumstances that have a minimum level of evidence
recorded against them will directly impact the outcome of the
assessment. The Resources page provides a list of circumstances and the
minimum level of evidence required for the circumstance to directly
impact the CA outcome.

Circumstance category

The circumstance category indicates how often a particular circumstance
affects the job seekers ability to meet their mutual obligation
requirements. When an assessment of a circumstance is completed, the
category outcome will be either:

Does not impact ability to comply, requirements reasonable

-   nil impact on a job seekers ability to meet their mutual obligation
    requirements

Sometimes impacts ability to comply, requirements reasonable

-   occasionally impacts, rather than impacting all of the time

Regularly impacts ability to comply, requirements require update

-   the circumstances often impacts the job seeker from meeting their
    requirements

Services Australia responsibilities

All Service Officers and specialists are responsible for identifying
when a job seeker circumstance should be:

-   recorded, and/or
-   updated

Importantly, job seekers or participants who present with family and
domestic violence must have a consult with a social worker. PST-skilled
social workers accept consults relating to job seeker compliance
actions, and social workers within service centres or smart centres
accept consults for all other matters. See the Process page for further
information.

The Resources page contains attachments describing when the various job
seeker circumstances categories can be added, updated or ended, and the
evidence required for different circumstances.
