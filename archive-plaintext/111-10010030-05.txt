Reclassification and separator pages

Reclassification pages are used to classify non-barcoded documents and
allow the documents to be attached to the customer record without
waiting for manual classification.

Blueprint Migration\RDT Release Icons\32w\icon-attachment.png] Separator
(Patch T) and Reclassification PDFs

Patch T separator pages are used to create a separate digital image on
the customer record. A common use is when a customer supplies documents
for 2 different claims or pieces of work that will be processed
separately. Place a Patch T separator in-between. Patch T separator
pages should always be printed single sided and not photocopied.

Note: the documents below must be printed double sided. They should be
replaced regularly and not photocopied.

Coversheets

The Received 'as is' coversheet can be used if staff preparing documents
for scanning believe:

-   something could be missing
-   the information relates to multiple people, or
-   the originals are of poor quality

This will ensure no rescans are required.

Place the coversheet behind any barcoded pages before scanning.

|                                   | Some forms may need guillotining  |
|                                   | to allow A4 scanning.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Ensure pages are flat             | Make sure the page has been       |
|                                   | flattened out. Bent or crumpled   |
|                                   | pages can cause a paper jam in    |
|                                   | MFDs.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Damaged documents                 | A torn page, holes in the page or |
|                                   | other damage to a document may    |
|                                   | cause problems with scanning. If  |
|                                   | damage to a document causes any   |
|                                   | issues with scanning, staff may   |
|                                   | need to photocopy the document    |
|                                   | and scan the photocopy.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If damage to a document affects   |
|                                   | the image quality, include a      |
|                                   | Received 'as is' coversheet with  |
|                                   | the scan.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Ensure paper width is consistent  | The quality and thickness of the  |
|                                   | page can also cause problems,     |
|                                   | including paper jams. If this     |
|                                   | occurs, photocopy the document    |
|                                   | first then scan the photocopy.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Scan pages in page order          | If possible, scan documents in a  |
|                                   | page number or logical order. For |
|                                   | example, place payslips in date   |
|                                   | order.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | See the Scanning Order user guide |
|                                   | for correct ordering of documents |
|                                   | and separators for some common    |
|                                   | scenarios.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Ensure CRNs are not mixed         | Ensure documents for multiple     |
|                                   | customers are not scanned         |
|                                   | together as one package.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, if a customer and    |
|                                   | partner submit their paperwork    |
|                                   | for separate claims at the same   |
|                                   | time, these must be scanned       |
|                                   | separately.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Maintain scanners                 | Regular cleaning of the scanner   |
|                                   | glass will help preserve the      |
|                                   | clarity of the image.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ensure rollers on the scanner are |
|                                   | cleaned regularly. This helps to  |
|                                   | prevent paper jams.               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Ensure Reclassification Pages     | This applies when scanning        |
| used are of a high quality        | unstructured documents that       |
|                                   | require a reclassification page   |
|                                   | to ensure correct classification  |
|                                   | when scanning on a MFD.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the reclassification page is   |
|                                   | not clear or of a high quality,   |
|                                   | the digital image will be delayed |
|                                   | in being attached to the          |
|                                   | customers record.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Ensure CRNs are not for a child   | When scanning documents on an     |
| or deleted record                 | MFD, ensure a child or deleted    |
|                                   | record CRN is not being used.     |
|                                   | This will delay documents being   |
|                                   | correctly attached to a           |
|                                   | customerâ€™s record. Ensure the CRN |
|                                   | being used is valid before        |
|                                   | scanning.                         |
