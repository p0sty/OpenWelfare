|                                   | assistance determination, a new   |
|                                   | care determination will be made.  |
|                                   | That new care percentage will be  |
|                                   | used for both child support and   |

|                                   | their child Monty. Freda and      |

|                                   | Monty. Freda applies for a child  |
|                                   | support assessment in respect of  |
|                                   | Monty. As a family assistance     |

|                                   | been made the Registrar will use  |
|                                   | the existing FTB care             |
|                                   | determination.                    |

|                                   | Phillip. Phillip is currently     |
|                                   | included in a child support       |

|                                   | partner's receive FTB for         |
|                                   | Phillip, therefore any changes to |
|                                   | the care of Phillip must be       |
|                                   | notified to the Registrar.        |
|                                   | However if Jeremy and/or Jackie   |
