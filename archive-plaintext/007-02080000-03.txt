|                                   | after the child's date of birth   |

|                                   | Child arrives in Australia and is |
|                                   | assessed as residentially         |
|                                   | qualified as an FTB child, or is  |
|                                   | living with a customer who is     |

|                                   | Australia. If the child is not    |

|                                   | on their CRES/CHRES screen, when  |
|                                   | they leave Australia they will    |
|                                   | cease to be an eligible FTB       |

|                                   | overseas-born child is in the     |
|                                   | care of the FTB customer. If the  |
|                                   | child resides overseas and the    |
|                                   | FTB customer is living in         |
|                                   | Australia there would be a        |
|                                   | concern as to whether the child   |
|                                   | is really a dependent child in    |
|                                   | their care. If the child is not a |
|                                   | FTB child from birth, do not      |
|                                   | record them as in care from       |
|                                   | birth.                            |
