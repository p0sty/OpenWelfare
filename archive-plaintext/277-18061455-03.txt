This procedure details how to suspend or end an agreement where the
payee ceases to be eligible carer of a child and a Section 12
terminating event has not occurred.

Determine impact on agreement

If care changes for a child covered by an agreement, the effect on the
agreement will depend on whether the payee continues to be an eligible
carer with at least 35% care of the child, and if the agreement contains
any provisions dealing with the care change.

Note: if there has been a section 12 terminating event in respect of the
child, see Terminating events (Stage 2) and Ending a Child Support
agreement.

Table 1: This table provides information to determine the impact on the
agreement.
