Consideration of distance - assessment of daily care for CA and constant care for CP when carer and care receiver do not live together

Information and examples are provided below for assessing daily care for
CA and/or constant care for CP when the carer and care receiver are not
living together

Note: consider each case based on the circumstances. The distances and
times below are a guide only. The assessment of constant care does not
apply to CP (XWP). Care requirements for these carers only apply to CA.

Services Australia staff can access a mapping service link for 'Whereis'
to calculate the distance and travel time between a carer and care
receiver.

Whereis

-   Select the 'Get Directions' tab
-   Enter the 'To' and 'From' addresses and the mode of transport
-   Select 'Get Directions' tab for result
-   A map will display with an estimated time of travel

Note: if 'Whereis.com' is used when assessing daily or constant care,
then it must be recorded on the carer's record that Whereis.com was
used.

shared by the carer and care receiver task cards.

Assessing when the carer and care receiver live together in more than one private residence

Note: consider each case based on the circumstances. The below factors
are a guide only. The assessment of constant care does not apply to CP
(XWP). Care requirements for these carers only apply to CA.

It is possible the carer and care receiver live together in 2 homes.
This usually occurs when they are related, own their respective homes,
the homes are a significant distance apart and they stay at each other's
home regularly and for a reasonable time. Often the carer has a partner
or children and this prevents them from leaving their home permanently.

Consider:

-   distance and travel time between the homes
-   time spent at each home and how often?
-   start date of circumstance
-   time frame this is intended to continue
-   care required and provided at each home, for example eat, sleep or
    shower
-   any activities which are only done at one of the homes, for example
    laundry?
-   movement of possessions between homes, for example, clothes,
    toiletries, reading material, hobby items. Are these items at both
    homes all the time or are items moved between homes when they travel
-   caring equipment which is only at one of the homes

If there is a significant distance between the 2 homes and it would not
be reasonable for either the carer or the care receiver to travel
between the homes each day and they stay at each home for a reasonable
time on an ongoing basis, it would usually be accepted that care is
being provided in 2 homes.

It is not possible to define reasonable time, but it would need to
support the claim that the carer or care receiver is living in that
home.
