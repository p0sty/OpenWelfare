This document outlines the processing required when an Austudy claim is
received by Services Australia. Austudy can be paid to customers aged 25
years or over if they are currently undertaking or intending to
undertake an approved course of education or study or are undertaking a
full-time Australian Apprenticeship.

Claiming Austudy

Claims for Austudy can be lodged by customers or their correspondence
nominees using:

-   [] Centrelink online accounts
-   an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)
-   a Claim for Austudy (SY002) paper claim

For further information, including which nominee types have access to
online services see Initial contact with students or Australian
Apprentices claiming Youth Allowance (YA).

The Re-claim or Transfer of an Austudy or Youth Allowance (SY089) paper
claim lodged with a Date of Receipt on or after 1 April 2023 cannot be
accepted.

Straight through processing

Straight through processing is where a claim for a social security
payment or service is assessed using criteria to identify if it is
suitable for an automated grant outcome.

The system may process Austudy student claims automatically if they meet
these criteria:

-   Identity is confirmed
-   Residency requirements met
-   Tax file number recorded
-   Employment status requirements met
-   No change in known relationship details
-   No change in known children details
-   The customer does not identify as having a disability, a medical
    condition which impacts their ability to study or is in a
    bereavement period
-   Accommodation requirements are met
-   Study details can be confirmed

If a claim meets the criteria for automated assessment, DOCs or Display
Notes on the customer's record will show that ROXY has created these.

Customer contact

If a customer asks for an explanation or applies for a formal review of
the decision, the Service Officer must enter their own logon as the
Decision Maker and the customer's local service centre when running the
script.

If the claim was incorrectly granted, give feedback via ROXY.

Rejecting Austudy claims

Customers who lodge a claim for Austudy may not be eligible for payment
because they do not meet the basic qualification, payability or
obligation requirements for payment.

Sometimes customers may lodge an inappropriate or incorrect claim.

In all these circumstances, claims must be rejected. Different
procedures apply if the customer withdraws their claim.

Employer lump sums

Customers claiming Austudy who receive a lump sum from employment, such
as leave or redundancy payments, may have an Income Maintenance Period
(IMP) imposed before they can receive Austudy payments.

Austudy is also subject to a Seasonal Work Preclusion Period (SWPP). If
a customer is serving a SWPP and transfers to Austudy, they will be
precluded from Austudy until their SWPP has ended.

Austudy customers may be entitled to a range of other additional
products and services including Pension Supplement for eligible
customers over Age Pension age, or Rent Assistance (RA).

Reassessments required due to review of decision

If a customer receives a favourable decision after requesting a review,
a new claim is not needed. The previous claim must be reassessed.

Social Online Application (SOA) Shell

When a Claim for Austudy (SY002) paper claim is scanned onto a
customer's record, the system creates a SOA Shell for allocation and
processing in Process Direct.

A claim can be created using the SOA Shell application within Process
Direct, if:

-   a customer is subject to a re-grant or reassessment, and
-   an online claim or Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) is not available to
    re-index

For example, to implement an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) decision
where no new claim has been lodged.

Do not use a SOA Shell in place of re-indexing a determined Austudy
online claim or ACC.

Education Entry Payment (EdEP)

Austudy is not a qualifying payment for EdEP. However, staff must check
a customer's eligibility for EdEP when they are transferring to Austudy,
or Youth Allowance (YA) (student) from another payment. This check is
part of the Austudy new claim assessment process.

Health Care Card (HCC)

Austudy students and Australian Apprentices are automatically issued a
HCC after their claim is granted.

If the student or Australian Apprentice transfers from a payment that
includes a Pension Concession Card (PCC), the PCC entitlement ceases on
the payment transfer date.

Australian Apprentices

Only limited Apprenticeship trained staff have access to the Access
Apprenticeships site required to process Apprentice claims for Austudy.
