This document outlines details of the Disbursement interview process
when a customer exits Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients (VWPR)
Income Management.

Disbursement interview

Customers can request to attend a Disbursement interview to discuss how
they will manage ongoing expenses and how residual funds will be paid
when Income Management ends.

If a customer does not attend a Disbursement interview or make contact
with the agency when Income Management ends, the Auto Disbursement rules
are used.

Reasons Income Management ends

VWPR Income Management will end when the customer:

Is no longer receiving a category H welfare payment

Has an excluded payment nominee for Income Management purposes

Has been automatically identified for VWPR Income Management and they
have:

-   Been granted an exclusion from Income Management, or
-   Requested to exit Income Management as they no longer have the
    automatic eligibility trigger (for example, no longer receive the
    Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) rate of payment, transferred
    from Youth Allowance (YA) to JobSeeker Payment (JSP))

Has been assessed for VWPR by a social worker and:

-   The Vulnerable Notice expires, or
-   A social worker has reviewed the customer's situation and determined
    the customer is no longer vulnerable, so the Notice is ended

This procedure does not cover the action required if a customer has
passed away.

Discussions at a Disbursement interview

The following will be discussed with customers who request to attend a
Disbursement interview:

-   If appropriate, how any residual income managed funds will be
    disbursed, including confirmation of bank details
-   Using Centrepay or the Rent Deduction Scheme to meet ongoing
    expenses
-   Eligibility for another measure of Income Management
-   Continued use of their BasicsCard for up to 60 days after Income
    Management ends
-   The option to have a payment nominee
-   Where to find more information to help manage their finances. A
    customer can visit servicesaustralia.gov.au/managingmoney for useful
    information and resources, and
-   Offer a referral to Financial Wellbeing and Capability Activities

Preparing for a Disbursement interview

To prepare for a Disbursement interview, Service Officers should:

-   Check whether the customer requires an interpreter. If required
    refer to Booking an interpreter for an appointment
-   Investigate the record to determine whether the customer is eligible
    for another Income Management measure, or likely to become eligible
    in the near future
-   Check the customer's available Income Management funds
-   Check whether the customer has an active BasicsCard and the current
    balance
-   Check the record for any vulnerability indicators as the customer
    may benefit from a referral to a social worker, and
-   Have the relevant communication products on hand (for example,
    Centrepay information, Nominee forms)
