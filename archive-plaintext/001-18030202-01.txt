This document outlines how non-compliance with mutual obligation
requirements is managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework.

Objectives of the Targeted Compliance Framework

The Targeted Compliance Framework used by Workforce Australia and
Disability Employment Services (DES) providers to encourage job seekers
to meet their mutual obligation requirements. That is, to do all that
they can to find work and/or participate in employment services and
other activities designed to improve their employment prospects.

The Targeted Compliance Framework:

-   uses payments suspensions to encourage re-engagement by job seekers
    who miss the occasional requirement but are generally compliant
-   supports job seekers who are identified as vulnerable to help ensure
    their requirements are appropriate for their circumstances
-   uses increasing penalties for those job seekers who continue to fail
    to meet their requirements without a reasonable excuse ending in
    payment cancellation for the most non-compliance job seekers

Job seeker and participant responsibility

Job seekers and participants are encouraged to remain engaged with their
provider and their compulsory requirements. They are also encouraged to:

-   ensure their provider is aware of their circumstances, including any
    circumstances that prevent compliance
-   update their electronic calendar by recording a Personal Event to
    let their provider know of personal obligations
-   remain in contact with their provider to meet their compulsory
    activities and appointments
-   contact their provider prior to the scheduled start time if unable
    to meet a requirement
-   record their own attendance at requirements, if required
-   accepting all offers of suitable work
-   contact their provider (including the Digital Service Contact Centre
    if they are receiving Workforce Australia services online) if they
    are unable to record their own attendance online

Leaving or refusing suitable work

Unemployment and work refusal failures reinforce the community
expectation that a person should not expect immediate financial
assistance if they:

-   voluntarily leave suitable work
-   are dismissed from suitable work as a result of misconduct, or
-   refuse or fail to commence suitable work

When an unemployment failure is applied:

-   customers claiming a participation payment will be subject to a 4
    week unemployment preclusion period, affecting their payment start
    day by up to 4 weeks
-   job seekers receiving a participation payment will have their
    participation payment cancelled with a 4 week post cancellation
    non-payment period applied. They will need to re-claim a
    participation payment to receive payments again

When a work refusal failure has been applied:

-   job seekers receiving a participation will have their payment
    cancelled with a 4 week post cancellation non-payment period. The
    job seeker will need to re-claim a participation payment at the end
    of the preclusion period to receive payments again

Managing compliance with compulsory requirements

The Targeted Compliance Framework consists of 3 zones for job seekers
and participants, these zones are called the:

-   Green Zone
-   Warning Zone
-   Penalty Zone

The Green Zone

All job seekers and participants begin their return to work journey in
the Green Zone. They remain in the Green Zone as long as they meet their
all of their compulsory mutual obligation requirements. No financial
penalties will apply to the job seeker or participant in the Green Zone,
except for work refusal or unemployment failures.

The Warning Zone

Job seekers who fail to meet a mutual obligation requirement without a
valid reason accrue a demerit and move into the Warning Zone. Providers
(or Employment Services System (ESS)) identify a mutual obligation
failure has occurred and the job seeker receives a notice telling them:

-   they may have missed a mutual obligation requirement, and
-   they must contact their provider within 2 business days to avoid
    having their payment suspended

If the job seeker does not contact their provider within 2 business
days, their payment suspends. Payment remains suspended until they
contact their provider and meet any reengagement requirements the
provider sets.

Once the job seeker contacts to reengage, the provider will decide if
the job seeker did or did not have a valid reason for missing a
compulsory mutual obligation requirement. If the provider decided there
was not a valid reason, a demerit is recorded The first demerit will
move the job seeker from the Green Zone into the Warning Zone.

Generally, where a mutual obligation failure has occurred and the job
seeker did not have a valid reason one demerit is accrued. However,
mutual obligation failures relating to job interviews will fast-track a
job seeker to the next Targeted Compliance Framework assessment point.
Fast-track mutual obligation failures are:

-   non-attendance at a job interview
-   misconduct at a job interview, or
-   failing to act on a job offer

The Targeted Compliance Framework assessments points are the:

-   Capability Interview (conducted by the provider), and
-   Capability Assessment (conducted by Participation Solutions Team
    (PST) skilled staff at Services Australia)

No financial penalties will apply to the job seeker or participant in
the Warning Zone, except for work refusal or unemployment failures. Each
demerit contributes to the job seeker's demerit point count for 6 active
months. Job seekers return to the Green Zone automatically when all
demerits expire.

The Warning Zone - Capability Interviews and Capability Assessments

Providers continue to monitor a job seekers compliance with their mutual
obligation requirements in the Warning Zone.

Repeated non-compliance may trigger the job seeker to reach an
assessment point of either the:

-   Capability Interview, or
-   Capability Assessment

A Capability Interview is:

-   an assessment completed by a provider when a job seeker accrues 3
    demerits within a 6 month period or the job seeker has been fast
    tracked
-   an assessment of the appropriateness of a job seekers requirements
    based on their individual circumstances

The outcome of a Capability Interview is either, the job seeker:

-   returns to the Green Zone (with demerits reset to zero), when their
    requirements are considered inappropriate for their circumstances,
    or
-   continues in the Warning Zone when their requirements are considered
    appropriate for their circumstances

A Capability Assessment is:

-   a further assessment completed by a PST-skilled staff when a job
    seeker accrues 5 demerits in a 6 month period or has been fast
    tracked
-   to ensure the job seekers requirements are achievable based on their
    individual circumstances

The outcome of the Capability Assessment is either the job seeker:

returns to the Green Zone (with demerits reset to zero) due to the job
seeker:

-   disclosing a new circumstances affecting their ability to meet their
    current requirements, or
-   requirements are otherwise inappropriate for their circumstances

moves into the Penalty Zone with their requirements considered
appropriate for their circumstances

The Penalty Zone

Job seekers transition to the Penalty Zone where:

-   their provider considers requirements are appropriate to their
    circumstances (following a Capability Interview), and
-   a Capability Assessment conducted by Services Australia confirms the
    job seeker is capable of meeting their current Job/Participation
    Plan requirements

In this zone, job seekers who:

-   meet their compulsory requirements for 3 active months will return
    to the Green Zone (demerits reset to zero), and
-   those who continue to be non-compliant will face financial penalties
    or payment cancellation

A mutual obligation failure will restart a job seekers active month
period in the Penalty Zone, whereas work refusal and unemployment
failures extend a job seekers time in the Penalty Zone.

Job seekers who commit a mutual obligation failure in the Penalty Zone,
will have their payment suspended immediately, encouraging job seekers
to contact their provider to discuss.

If the provider does not believe the job seeker had a valid reason for
their non-compliance, they will submit a Provider report for Services
Australia to investigate a possible penalty. The Provider report becomes
an active failure for investigation by PST staff on the job seeker's
reporting date.

Job seekers may accept a mutual obligation failure penalty when they
report online. Job seekers who wish to discuss their reasons for non
compliance will have an investigation conducted by PST staff. During the
investigation, if reasonable excuse is not established the failure is
applied. The applied failure will result in a financial penalty.

Returning to the Green Zone

Fully compliant job seekers will automatically return to the Green Zone
after 3 active months. ESS monitors and calculates the period a job
seeker is in the Penalty Zone. Services Australia has no involvement or
responsibility in determining the three active month period.

Non-Compliance cancellation and post cancellation non-payment period

A non-compliance cancellation occurs when a job seeker in receipt of a
participation payment:

-   fails to accept or commence suitable work (work refusal failure)
-   voluntarily leaves suitable work without reasonable excuse
    (unemployment failure)
-   is dismissed from suitable employment due to misconduct as a worker
    (unemployment failure)
-   has a third financial penalty applied for a persistent mutual
    obligation failure

Where payment is cancelled, the job seeker enters a post cancellation
non-payment period:

-   A post cancellation non-payment period is 4 weeks, or 6 weeks for an
    unemployment failure where the job seeker received Relocation
    Assistance for the job in the previous 6 months. During this period
    a participation payment is not payable. There are no waiver
    provisions, however the job seeker will maintain concession card and
    benefit rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) eligibility
-   At the end of, or during, the post cancellation non-payment period,
    job seekers may reclaim a participation payment. They will be
    subject to RapidConnect and, if returning to payment at the end of
    the preclusion period, they return to the Targeted Compliance
    Framework zone they were in prior to the non-compliance cancellation

Services Australia responsibilities

Services Australia works with providers to ensure job seekers understand
their mutual obligation requirements, and the impact if they do not meet
them by:

-   referring them to talk to their provider if they are suspended TCF
    (Did not meet provider requirement) or TCW (Provider work refusal
    failure)
-   recording circumstances impacting job seeker compliance when a
    jobseeker discloses these
-   reminding them to talk to their provider about any circumstances
    that may be affecting their ability to meet their requirements
-   reminding them if they cannot meet a requirement, to contact their
    provider before the requirement
-   reminding them if they miss a requirement, to contact their provider
    as quickly as possible, within 2 business days to avoid payment
    suspension
-   reminding them to record personal events in their Workforce
    Australia calendar to alert their provider

Participation Solution Team (PST) skilled staff with the WNPPD security
resource are responsible for:

-   determining if reasonable excuse for a mutual obligation failure has
    been established
-   determining if a work refusal (WNPPD only) or unemployment failure
    has been committed
-   actioning review and appeals outcomes for decisions made under
    Social Security Legislation
-   conducting Capability Assessments

Staff who process job seeker claims and have a UNPP security resource
are responsible for determining an unemployment failure at new claim.

Consultation with the PST Virtual Support Queue, PST-skilled social
worker or other specialist officer may be appropriate when assessing the
impact of a job seeker's circumstances on their capacity to comply. See
Accessing a PST-skilled social worker for information on when
consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be appropriate.
