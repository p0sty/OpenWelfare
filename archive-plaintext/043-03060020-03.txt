|                                   |     likely current income         |
|                                   |     received by a customer from a |

|                                   |     of the business. For example, |
|                                   |     if the business has lost a    |
|                                   |     contract or suffered some     |
|                                   |     other reduction in income,    |
|                                   |     ask the customer to provide   |

|                                   |     should generally be ignored   |

|                                   |     trading. For example, if a    |

|                                   |     support, it would be          |
|                                   |     necessary to look at the      |
|                                   |     pattern of trading. If        |
|                                   |     business always reduces after |
|                                   |     the Christmas period then     |
|                                   |     this would not be considered  |
