+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

If the expenditure exceeds the Service Officers delegation level, they
must seek expenditure approval from the required delegation level.

|                                   | motor vehicle allowance for the   |

|                                   | a testing and assessment exercise |
|                                   | at the University of Western      |

|                                   | takes approximately 4 hours. The  |

|                                   | It is unreasonable and            |
|                                   | impractical to expect Rhiannon to |
|                                   | travel by bus for 14 hours each   |
|                                   | way to undertake a testing and    |
|                                   | assessment activity of only 4     |
|                                   | hours. In these circumstances, an |
|                                   | economy air ticket would be       |
|                                   | approved for Rhiannon to          |
|                                   | undertake the journey to          |

|                                   | listed for a scholarship at       |
|                                   | Presbyterian Ladies College in    |
|                                   | Perth. Jenny is required to       |
|                                   | undertake an interview at the     |
|                                   | school.                           |

|                                   | The appropriate mode of transport |
|                                   | from Geraldton to Perth is an     |
|                                   | economy class bus journey. Due to |
|                                   | the bus schedules, Jenny would    |
|                                   | have to travel on the day prior   |
|                                   | to the interview and then return  |
|                                   | on the day after the interview.   |
|                                   | This would require meals and      |
|                                   | accommodation for 2 nights in     |
|                                   | Perth. Due to Jenny's age, a      |
|                                   | supervisor or family member would |
|                                   | need to also travel to supervise  |
|                                   | Jenny for the 2 nights.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is more cost-effective to      |
|                                   | approve a flight for Jenny to     |
|                                   | travel to and from the interview  |
|                                   | on the same day. Whilst the       |
|                                   | flight is more expensive than the |
|                                   | bus ticket, it is more            |
|                                   | cost-effective when considering   |
|                                   | the additional costs associated   |
|                                   | with supervisor or family member  |
|                                   | travel and 2 nights of meals and  |
|                                   | accommodation costs.              |

|                                   | 10:30 pm. This is considered an   |
