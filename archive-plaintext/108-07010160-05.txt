| 1                                 | Customer's rate reduces to nil    |
|                                   | part way through an entitlement   |
|                                   | period                            |

|                                   | Employment income nil rate        |
|                                   | periods start from the            |
|                                   | Entitlement Period Start Day      |
|                                   | (EPSD) of the first fortnight     |
|                                   | where a customer would get a zero |
|                                   | payment for that entitlement      |
|                                   | period.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system works on a daily rate  |
|                                   | and often determines that the     |
|                                   | customer's rate is nil (on a      |
|                                   | daily basis) part way through an  |
|                                   | entitlement period. This can be   |
|                                   | because the customer's Working    |
|                                   | Credits run out part way through  |
|                                   | the period.                       |

|                                   | For example, a customer may be    |
|                                   | paid a part payment in an         |
|                                   | entitlement period because their  |
|                                   | Working Credits do not deplete    |
|                                   | until day five of the period. The |

|                                   | the employment income nil rate    |

|                                   | customer's rate goes to zero on a |
|                                   | daily basis.                      |

|                                   | -   the customer will be paid a   |
|                                   |     part rate for the first 5     |

|                                   | -   they will be on a nil rate of |
