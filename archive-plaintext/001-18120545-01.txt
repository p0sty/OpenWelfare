This document explains when to accept an early or late lodgement of a
job seeker report.

Early reporting

Reporting Statement (SU19) due date

A statement reporter job seeker must report on their on their
Entitlement Period End Date (EPED). The questions in the Reporting
Statement relate to the full fortnight period or the relevant period for
variable reporters.

Early reporting can be accepted if:

-   a customer changes their pay day code, see Changing Entitlement
    Period End Dates (EPED)
-   special arrangements are in place for national public holidays (such
    as Easter, Christmas, Anzac Day and Australia Day). Job seekers will
    be notified of their early reporting date, see Payment and reporting
    arrangements over national public holiday periods
-   customer advises they are going overseas, see Recording and
    correcting employment income details

Customers can view a summary of due to report dates and reporting
periods in their online account. All reporting periods within 12 weeks
of the date viewed will display. The summary is accessed by selecting
Income and Assets > Employment Income > Next reporting periods from the
menu.

Variable reporting

A job seeker on variable reporting can use self-managed service
reporting on their non-stimulus Entitlement Period End Date (EPED).

If the job seeker, or their partner, receives a family assistance
payment, they may need to update their estimate due to the change in
income.

Late reporting

Determining and recording a late report

If a job seeker reports late or a self service reporter is referred to a
Service Officer after the report 'drops through', discuss the reason for
late reporting and remind the job seeker to report on their due date to
avoid delays in payment.

Note: there may be barriers to participation for Indigenous customers.

Determine:

-   whether or not the reason for late reporting is acceptable
-   if any special circumstances apply for reporting form late, and
-   if payment will be approved and processed

The Service Officer must record:

-   whether or not the reason is satisfactory/acceptable, and
-   how the job seeker met mutual obligation requirements during this
    period, and
-   whether the customer has a pending compliance investigation

Reason for late reporting not acceptable

If the reason(s) for late reporting is not acceptable, the Service
Officer can cancel/suspend payment and advise the job seeker of the
decision. If payment is cancelled, tell the job seeker to test their
eligibility and re-claim a payment. Job seekers must be advised in
writing the reason their payment is cancelled or suspended.

Outstanding compliance action

Where a job seeker has a participation-related payment suspension or
outstanding compliance action, they will need to re-engage with their
employment services provider and/or speak to the Participation Solutions
Team (PST) about any outstanding failure investigation before reporting
can be finalised. Service Officers must check the Participation
Compliance workflow summary and where the:

-   Completed/Provider to Action section shows outstanding compliance
    actions the provider is responsible for managing, advise the job
    seeker to contact their provider, and/or
-   Outstanding section shows a compliance investigation is outstanding,
    assist the job seeker to contact the PST

Note: any changes to the customer's circumstances must be updated before
the customer contacts PST.

Self service for reporting customers

The obligation to report on their due date applies to job seekers who
use self service (online, Express Plus mobile app or phone self service
(IVR)). Self service reporters can report up to 13 days after the due
date without any penalty or cancellation.

If the job seeker tries to report more than 13 days after their due
Entitlement Period End Date (EPED) using self service channels,
reporting will not be available as they will be cancelled Did Not Lodge
(CAN-DNL). The job seeker will receive a message which will refer them
to a Service Officer for assistance.

Job seekers can:

-   update and correct reported employment income online using the
    Update employment income service to change their initial report
-   correct employment income reported in the last 6 reporting periods

Note: employment income confirmed via the Single Touch Payroll (STP)
channel cannot be corrected via self service. Customers must discuss
changes and provide evidence to staff.

Genuine attempts must be made to transition customers to report via self
service options before assisted reporting is completed, unless an
exception applies.

Customer fails to report

A job seeker's payment is not generated until they have reported. Late
reporting (after 5pm on the due date) can delay the customer and/or
their partner's payment.

If the partner is a:

-   notification reporter, payment is made automatically regardless of
    whether the customer has reported or not
-   statement reporter (fortnightly/2 weekly), payment is generated when
    the job seeker reports. When the job seeker reports, their partner's
    payment is generated, unless the partner has mutual obligation
    requirements and is also required to report

If a job seeker fails to report for 2 consecutive fortnights (28 days),
the payment will cancel automatically from Date Paid To +1 (DPT +1). For
more information, see JobSeeker Payment (JSP) cancellations, suspensions
and restorations.

Variable reporting customer fails to report

If the customer is on variable reporting, payments issued automatically
cannot be proven until they have reported. For example, if the customer
doesn't report within 15 days of their reporting date, payment will
cancel back to date last reported +1.

If a job seeker was on a variable reporting cycle when their payment
cancelled did not lodge (CAN/DNL) or cancelled failed to report
(CAN/FRP), the system automatically creates an undetermined debt shell.
The debt shell is automatically placed on hold for 21 days to allow time
for the job seeker to make contact and report. If the job seeker reports
while the debt shell is on hold, it will adjust if the payment is
restored. If no report has occurred in the 21 days the debt shell is on
hold, the debt can then be investigated.

When a debt shell is created, a cancellation letter is automatically
sent to the job seeker. This letter advises the job seeker to report
within 14 days of receiving the notification by contacting Services
Australia by phone or going to a service centre. The letter includes a
warning that failure to report may result in a debt being raised for
payments already received within the reporting period.

Reporting within 13 weeks of payment cancellation

If the job seeker is seeking restoration and reports within 13 weeks of
payment cancellation and it is has been determined:

-   the job seeker was entitled to payment during that period, and
-   continuing ongoing entitlement has been established,

payment must be restored from the cancellation date and the customer
must report for each 2 weekly reporting period from their cancellation
date. The reports can be confirmed verbally if the mutual obligation
requirements have been met and all employment income is reported for
each 2 weekly reporting period.

When the job seeker's income support payment is:

-   suspended or cancelled, outstanding compliance action is maintained
    where it is likely the payment may be restored back to the
    suspension/cancellation date
-   restored, outstanding compliance action may need to be actioned
    before reporting can be finalised
-   cancelled for a participation-related reason, the payment may not be
    restorable and the job seeker may have to reclaim payment

If the system prompts arrears, ensure arrears are correct, particularly
if a debt has already been raised due to the job seeker failing to
report.

If arrears have been manually adjusted to ensure a duplicate payment is
not made, the Service Officer must send a Fast Note to the relevant Debt
Raising Team to allow adjustment of the debt. The Debt Raising Team is
responsible for adjusting the debt.

Report more than 13 weeks after cancellation

Job seekers must lodge a new claim if it is 13 weeks or more since
notification of cancellation.

If the job seeker applies for a formal review of the cancellation
decision, normal review and appeal procedures must be followed.
