|                                   | The only exception is when a      |
|                                   | prize won by chance is paid       |
|                                   | periodically, for example,        |
|                                   | scratch-it cards where regular    |
|                                   | payments are made, as opposed to  |
|                                   | a single lump sum, in which case, |
|                                   | income is assessed as the amount  |
|                                   | received each period for the      |
|                                   | duration of that period. For      |
|                                   | instance, someone receiving       |
|                                   | $1,000 on the first day of each   |
|                                   | month would have $1,000 per month |
|                                   | recorded until 1 month after the  |
|                                   | last payment. For this:           |

|                                   | These periodic chance winnings    |
|                                   | cannot be reduced by ‘losses’ in  |

|                                   | This is because these winnings    |
|                                   | are not the result of a customer  |
|                                   | using their skill to earn an      |
|                                   | income through a business         |

|                                   | profession, for example, a        |
|                                   | sportsperson or professional      |
|                                   | gambler (usually declared on tax  |
|                                   | returns as such) are assessed as  |
|                                   | income. They may be considered as |
|                                   | running a business as a sole      |
|                                   | trader (or in partnership), in    |

|                                   | income is determined, based on    |
|                                   | winnings less expenses, which     |
|                                   | include verifiable losses.        |

|                                   | they should be treated as running |
|                                   | a business and asked for regular  |
|                                   | (for example, annual) profit and  |
|                                   | loss statements. (Note: losses    |
|                                   | are valid expenses only when      |
|                                   | income is assessed as part of a   |
|                                   | business structure). A one off    |
|                                   | win in an area outside of the     |
|                                   | customer's profession is an       |
|                                   | exempt lump sum. For example, if  |
|                                   | a customer who is a professional  |
|                                   | poker player won $100 for best    |
|                                   | cake decoration at a show, this   |
|                                   | is not assessable income.         |

|                                   | Regardless if the winnings are    |
|                                   | assessed as income or not, the    |
|                                   | resulting assets are assessable   |
|                                   | under the normal assets test.     |
|                                   | Deprivation is assessed if the    |
