Note: always determine the full-time hours based on that school's
standard hours.

Home-based study percentages - study by subjects or lessons

Table 3

Always determine as per that school's lesson offering or the standard
number of subjects/lessons needed for that child for that year of study.
For example, in New South Wales, full-time secondary study may be 6
subjects/lessons, but full-time senior secondary study may be 5
subjects/lessons.
