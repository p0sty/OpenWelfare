This document outlines the different categories for when a student is
considered isolated for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC). It
includes how to verify isolated conditions.

Isolation conditions

The AIC Scheme helps families in isolated areas with the extra costs to
educate their children.

Isolation from an appropriate state school is one of the eligibility
conditions for payment.

A student is considered isolated when their family circumstances fall
into one of the following categories:

-   Geographical isolation
-   Students with special needs
-   Students deemed to be isolated

Reasonable daily access

AIC allowances are for the families of students who do not have
reasonable daily access to an appropriate state school.

This is determined by considering the distance and travel circumstances
between the:

-   principal family home and
-   nearest appropriate state school

Limited program school

The state or territory government Department of Education decides if a
school or years of study have limited programs.

Limited program or 'bypass' schools' are not appropriate state schools
when determining a student's geographic isolation for AIC eligibility.

If the student is studying in a year in which the school offers a
limited program the next closest appropriate state school is used for
assessing isolation.

These schools can be primary or secondary schools that either:

-   do not offer a full range of years or grades
-   do not have facilities or programs for a student to gain a year 12
    certificate or equivalent or tertiary entrance score
-   have syllabus and teaching arrangements for specific student groups
    that may be considered limited compared to the general curriculum of
    the state or territory

Remote community schools that mainly cater for Indigenous students are
limited program schools in:

-   Western Australia (WA)
-   South Australia (SA)
-   Northern Territory (NT)

The Resources page contains a list of schools offering limited programs.
