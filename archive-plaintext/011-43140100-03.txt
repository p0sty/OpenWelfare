Customer phones with a digital self service claim enquiry

Do not process Medicare online account (MOA) claims on the same day they
are lodged (day zero) where the total amount of the claims is greater
than or equal to $100.

If the customer is in financial hardship and insisting the claim be paid
on day zero:

-    staff must call the clinic to confirm the account is valid, see
    Suspected Medicare fraud and Business Integrity (BI) flags
-    if after hours, tell the customer that the claim will be actioned
    on the following business day
-    if staff cannot verify the details or the call is after hours,
    recategorise the claim in PaNDA to MOA - Medicare Claim Escalated
-    for further assistance, escalate to a Medicare and Aged Care –
    Local Peer Support (LPS) for help
