This document explains the actions to follow to determine if a
participation failure has occurred when a YA or Austudy student has not
met the participation requirements for their payment. It further
outlines the process for Youth Allowance customers that have signed and
a Youth Allowance Activity Agreement where the customer does not meet
the participation requirements for YA.

Circumstances when a participation failure applies

Customers receiving Austudy or Youth Allowance (YA) may be subject to a
participation failure if they do not have a reasonable excuse for not
attending an appointment with Services Australia about their study or
Activity Test requirements.

A participation failure may also apply to students receiving Youth
Allowance who have signed a Youth Allowance Activity Agreement and have
not met the requirements set out in the activity agreement. See Activity
Agreements for Youth Allowance (YA) students.

ABSTUDY, Australian Apprentices and trainees

The participation failure procedures do not apply to:

-   ABSTUDY customers assessed under the specific breach framework
-   Australian Apprentices receiving YA or Austudy. These customers are
    exempt from full-time study requirements at all times
-   Trainees in a course that does not qualify them for payment as a
    full-time student or an Australian Apprentice. These customers are
    regarded as job seekers and are required to comply with activities
    negotiated in a Job/Participation Plan

Examples of when a student may incur a participation failure

Students may incur a participation failure if they:

-   fail to comply with the terms of a previously negotiated Youth
    Allowance Activity Agreement in relation to secondary school
    attendance
-   fail to attend a participation related service profiling appointment
-   fail to attend an appointment booked to enable a Youth Allowance
    Activity Agreement to be negotiated
-   do not have a reasonable excuse for not attending an appointment
    about their full-time study requirements

Examples of when a student will not incur a participation failure

The student will not incur a participation failure if they:

-   are not enrolled in and/or undertaking full-time (or qualifying)
    study
-   are not enrolling in and/or undertaking the course of study
    following an intention to do so
-   are not commencing the course of study by the Friday of the second
    week of classes
-   are a continuing student, not enrolling in the course when the
    enrolments are next accepted
-   are a YA student and have not signed a Youth Allowance Activity
    Agreement
-   fail to attend a non-participation related appointment. In this
    scenario suspension of the payment is the appropriate option
-   leave employment voluntarily or through misconduct and claim a
    payment as a student

Students will fail to satisfy the full-time study requirements for YA,
or activity test for Austudy if they are no longer in full-time study.
This may result in a loss of qualification for their payment.

An exception may apply to YA and Austudy students if their study load
reduces due to a temporary incapacity. See:

Austudy student or Australian Apprentice becomes incapacitated

Youth Allowance (YA) student or Australian Apprentice becomes
incapacitated

Penalties related to earnings

A penalty may apply if a student:

-   refuses to declare earnings from employment
-   fails to correctly declare earnings from employment
-   recklessly or knowingly gives false or misleading information about
    earnings

A debt will be raised for any overpayment and a 10% recovery fee may be
applied. A participation failure or loss of qualification for payment is
not applicable in these circumstances

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision the Decision Maker(DM), including
Service Officers within Smart Centre Call, must:

-   provide the customer with an explanation of the decision
-   give the customer an opportunity to provide further information or
    evidence relevant to the decision
-   advise the customer of their review and appeal rights
-   if the customer is not available at the time of the decision, make 2
    genuine contact attempts before finalising the decision

For more details, see Initial contact about a decision and the review of
decision process.
