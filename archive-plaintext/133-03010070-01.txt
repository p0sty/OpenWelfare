This document outlines how customers can make a claim online. Service
Officers may also offer an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC).

Claim types

[] Customers with a Centrelink online account can claim the following
payments:

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the current financial year which
automatically includes Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront
Payment (NBU) if they:

-   indicate they do not intend claiming PPL, or
-   are not eligible for PPL for the child

FTB as a lump sum for the previous financial year

Parental Leave Pay (PPL)

Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)

Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) (DAP is not payable for children born or
adopted on or after 1 July 2023. Fathers and partners will need to claim
PPL)

For information on the online and ACC processes for the family
assistance payments not covered in this procedure, see how customers can
make an online claim for:

-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS) (grandfathered only)

Contact about claiming

[] Customers can use the Payment and Service Finder on the Services
Australia website. This will check for the most appropriate service
offer based on their circumstances.

Online

Customers need a Centrelink online account to claim:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
-   Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)
-   Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) (DAP is not payable for children born or
    adopted on or after 1 July 2023. Fathers and partners will need to
    claim PPL)

To start their claim they need to sign in to their Centrelink online
account through myGov.

Customers:

need to answer questions relevant to their circumstances

can save their responses and continue with their claim at a later time
(incomplete online claims expire if not submitted within 13 weeks of
being started)

can submit an online claim after:

-   answering all mandatory questions
-   accepting a declaration
-   uploading the required documents

Customers can voluntarily withdraw or cancel their claim within 14 days
of submitting an online claim.

Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)

Service Officers can complete the claim by running ACC with the customer
or start the claim in ACC and encourage the customer to finish the claim
online. Customers can monitor the progress of their completed claim
through:

-   their Centrelink online account, or
-   the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app

If a customer contacts after submitting an online claim or ACC, see
Progress of claims - Families claims.

The started ACC will expire if not submitted within 13 weeks.

Customers can also cancel the ACC if it is not yet submitted or withdraw
it after the claim has been submitted.

Early claims

Families customers can claim FTB, PPL, DAP, or a combination of these up
to 97 days before a child's:

-   expected date of birth, or
-   entry into care as part of an adoption process

Secondary claimants claiming PPL for a child born or adopted before 1
July 2023 can also claim in this period.

Note: Foster carers cannot pre-claim and claim should be rejected unless
it can be confirmed the child's entry into care is part of an adoption
process.

Verification of income

PPL and DAP customers may need to verify their income, unless their
income has already been verified for the relevant financial year.

Customers must verify their income if:

-   they have not already verified their income for the relevant
    financial year, and
-   their income is 90% and above of the relevant financial year income
    limit

The Next steps page advises the customer of further information or
documentation required for them to submit their claim.

Nominees

correspondence nominees.
