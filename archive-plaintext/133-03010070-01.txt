Online

Customers need a Centrelink online account to claim:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
-   Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)
-   Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)

To start their claim they need to sign in to their Centrelink online
account through myGov.

Customers:

need to answer questions relevant to their circumstances

can save their responses and continue with their claim at a later time
(incomplete online claims expire if not submitted within 13 weeks of
being started)

can submit an online claim after:

-   answering all mandatory questions
-   accepting a declaration
-   uploading the required documents

Customers can voluntarily withdraw or cancel their claim within 14 days
of submitting an online claim.

Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)

Service Officers can complete the claim by running ACC with the customer
or start the claim in ACC and encourage the customer to finish the claim
online. Customers can monitor the progress of their completed claim
through:

-   their Centrelink online account, or
-   the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app

If a customer contacts after submitting an online claim or ACC, see
Progress of claims - Families claims.

The started ACC will expire if not submitted within 13 weeks.

Customers can also cancel the ACC if it is not yet submitted or withdraw
it after the claim has been submitted.

Early claims

Families customers can claim FTB, PPL, DAP, or a combination of these up
to 97 days before a child's:

-   expected date of birth, or
-   entry into care as part of an adoption process

Secondary PPL customers can also claim in this period.

Note: Foster carers cannot pre-claim and claim should be rejected unless
it can be confirmed the child's entry into care is part of an adoption
process.

Verification of income

PPL and DAP customers may need to verify their income, unless their
income has already been verified for the relevant financial year.

Customers must verify their income if:

-   they have not already verified their income for the relevant
    financial year, and
-   their income is between $135,000 and the relevant financial year
    income limit

The Next steps page advises the customer of further information or
documentation required for them to submit their claim.
