PPL details for customers with children born or entering care both
before and on or after 1 July 2023.

This document outlines information for birth mothers who are claiming
Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and/or Family Tax Benefit (FTB) including
Newborn Supplement (NBS) and Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) for a child
leaving their care as part of the process of adoption or a surrogacy
arrangement.

Birth mother entitlements

Birth mothers may be eligible for PPL for the purposes of maternal
recovery when they relinquish the care of the child:

-   as part of the process of adoption
-   as part of a surrogacy arrangement, or
-   where the child has been removed from the customer's care by a state
    or territory child protection agency

Birth mothers may be eligible for FTB (which can also include NBS and
NBU if the customer is not eligible for PPL) for a newborn child if the
child remains in their care following the birth. The birth mother would
also need to be the primary carer of the child, for example the child
remains in their care for a specified time for breast feeding. Once the
child leaves their care, eligibility for FTB will cease.

General claim requirements

Early claims can be lodged up to 97 days before the child's expected
date of birth. Submitting an early claim before the child's birth allows
payment arrangements for PPL to be established, and lodging proof of
birth as soon as possible after the birth helps to avoid payment delays.

After the birth of the child, customers need to provide:

-   proof of the child's birth, and
-   confirmation the child has left the customer's care as part of the
    process of adoption or as a part of a surrogacy arrangement
