|                                   | -   the care receiver is with the |

|                                   |     needs. For example, carer is  |

|                                   | -   the weekly hours are more     |
|                                   |     than 25 and the determination |
|                                   |     is that the care needs have   |
|                                   |     been Met, and the reason for  |
|                                   |     the determination is clearly  |

|                                   | because the carer no longer       |
|                                   | provides constant care and        |
|                                   | attention. This is made according |
|                                   | to Section 198 of the Social      |
|                                   | Security Act 1991 (not section    |
|                                   | 198(AC)) because the requirement  |
|                                   | for constant care has not been    |
|                                   | met. It is not because 25 hours   |
|                                   | was exceeded. For links to the    |
