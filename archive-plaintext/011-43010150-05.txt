  Term                                     Description
  Brachytherapy                            The use of radioactive isotopes inserted into either tissue (interstitial) or body cavities (intracavity) to deliver radiation close to a tumour bed.
  Electron                                 The smallest particle of negative electricity. Electrons have a useful property of limited penetration of tissue as opposed to the exponential absorption that occurs with x-rays.
  External beam radiation therapy (EBRT)   Radiation therapy delivered at a distance from the body, most commonly by a linear accelerator. (Also called teletherapy.)
  Field                                    An area treated by the radiation beam at a particular angle. A radiotherapy treatment can be delivered using a single field or multiple fields at different angles.
  Fractionation                            The total dose of radiation to be delivered is divided by the daily dose (daily fraction) which gives a cumulative effect to the tumour but allows normal surrounding tissue to repair.
  Gamma radiation                          A photon produced from radioactive material.
  Megavolts (MV)                           A megavolt (millions of volts) is the unit of measurement of photons greater than 1 MeV energy. These are produced by Cobalt-60 apparatus and linear accelerators.

Text requirements and derived fee items

Table 2: this table shows the appropriate text/notation needed when
processing radiation oncology items. It also indicates which additional
field derived fee item matches to which single field base item

|                                   | services?                         |

|                                   | Answer: It is important to        |
|                                   | recognise the difference between  |
|                                   | transmission time (service time)  |
|                                   | and time noted in the Text field. |
|                                   | It is the health professional’s   |
|                                   | responsibility to provide the     |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Transmission time is the time |
|                                   |     recorded by the system if a   |
|                                   |     transmitted claim has been    |
|                                   |     sent. It is displayed in the  |
|                                   |     Service Time field            |
|                                   | -   Free text times is when the   |
|                                   |     health professional manually  |
|                                   |     enters the time into the text |
|                                   |     field                         |

|                                   | Therefore, if the only text is    |
|                                   | the transmission time, for        |
|                                   | example, 2 or 3 seconds/minutes   |
|                                   | apart this is not the appropriate |
|                                   | time notation and items should be |
|                                   | rejected. However, if the health  |
|                                   | professional provides an          |
|                                   | individual treatment/attendance   |
|                                   | times in the free text, then the  |
|                                   | items should be paid.             |
