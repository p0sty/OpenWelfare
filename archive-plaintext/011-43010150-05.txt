| Term                              | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Brachytherapy                     | The use of radioactive isotopes   |
|                                   | inserted into either tissue       |
|                                   | (interstitial) or body cavities   |
|                                   | (intracavity) to deliver          |
|                                   | radiation close to a tumour bed.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Electron                          | The smallest particle of negative |
|                                   | electricity. Electrons have a     |
|                                   | useful property of limited        |
|                                   | penetration of tissue as opposed  |
|                                   | to the exponential absorption     |
|                                   | that occurs with x-rays.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| External beam radiation therapy   | Radiation therapy delivered at a  |
| (EBRT)                            | distance from the body, most      |
|                                   | commonly by a linear accelerator. |
|                                   | (Also called teletherapy.)        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Field                             | An area treated by the radiation  |
|                                   | beam at a particular angle. A     |
|                                   | radiotherapy treatment can be     |
|                                   | delivered using a single field or |
|                                   | multiple fields at different      |
|                                   | angles.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Fractionation                     | The total dose of radiation to be |
|                                   | delivered is divided by the daily |
|                                   | dose (daily fraction) which gives |
|                                   | a cumulative effect to the tumour |
|                                   | but enables normal surrounding    |
|                                   | tissue to repair.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Gamma radiation                   | A photon produced from            |
|                                   | radioactive material.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Megavolts (MV)                    | A megavolt (millions of volts) is |
|                                   | the unit of measurement of        |
|                                   | photons greater than 1 MeV        |
|                                   | energy. These are produced by     |
|                                   | Cobalt-60 apparatus and linear    |
|                                   | accelerators.                     |

| 3                                 | Question: Which text/notations    |
|                                   | are acceptable to indicate        |
|                                   | separate occasions/separate       |
|                                   | attendances?                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The health professional   |
|                                   | must provide text or notation     |
|                                   | that indicate that the services   |
|                                   | performed were at separate        |
|                                   | attendances. This could be text   |
|                                   | stating ‘separate attendance’ or  |
|                                   | ‘separate occasion’ or the times  |
|                                   | on the same day e.g. 9am and      |
|                                   | 3:45pm.                           |

|                                   | radiotherapy items are performed  |
|                                   | on the same occasion?             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: This will depend on the   |
|                                   | radiotherapy treatment item       |
|                                   | numbers that are being claimed.   |
|                                   | If multiple primary sites apply,  |
|                                   | and a patient has more than one   |
|                                   | separate and distinct ‘primary    |
|                                   | tumour’, then the service         |
|                                   | text/notation should indicate the |
|                                   | different sites e.g. ‘right and   |
|                                   | left leg’.                        |

| 7                                 | Question: What is the appropriate |
|                                   | time field to pay multiple        |
|                                   | services?                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: It is important to        |
|                                   | recognise the difference between  |
|                                   | transmission time (service time)  |
|                                   | and time noted in the Text field. |
|                                   | It is the health professional’s   |
|                                   | responsibility to provide the     |
|                                   | correct text/notation.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Transmission time is the time |
|                                   |     recorded by the system when a |
|                                   |     transmitted claim has been    |
|                                   |     sent. It is displayed in the  |
|                                   |     Service Time field            |
|                                   | -   Free text times is when the   |
|                                   |     health professional manually  |
|                                   |     enters the time into the text |
|                                   |     field                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Therefore, if the only text is    |
|                                   | the transmission time e.g. 2 or 3 |
|                                   | seconds/minutes apart this is not |
|                                   | the appropriate time notation and |
|                                   | items should be rejected.         |
|                                   | However, if the health            |
|                                   | professional provides a           |
|                                   | individual treatment/attendance   |
|                                   | times in the free text, then the  |
|                                   | items should be paid.             |

|                                   | A verification item can only be   |
|                                   | claimed once per treatment        |
|                                   | attendance, irrespective of the   |
|                                   | number of treatment sites         |
|                                   | verified at that attendance.      |
