Reasonable action to claim compensation

A customer, or their partner, who are eligible to get compensation may
need to lodge a claim for payment of that compensation.

Scenarios

Table 1: Scenarios where a customer may be considered to have taken
reasonable action to claim compensation.

|                                   | to facilitate their recovery.     |

Acceptable reasons for not claiming or obtaining compensation

In some circumstances it may be acceptable for a customer to not pursue
a possible entitlement to compensation.

Scenarios

partner, not to claim compensation.

Consequences of failure to comply with the requirement to take action to claim or obtain compensation

When a customer and/or their partner fails to take action to claim or
obtain compensation they may be in breach of Section 1166 of the Act.

The consequences depend on whether the customer and/or their partner are
currently receiving payments or made a claim for payment.

| Failure or refusal to take action | A customer does not make a claim  |

| compensation without a valid      | difficult to comply with employer |
| reason                            | requests and withdraws their      |

| Refusal to accept a compensation  | The customer refuses to accept a  |

|                                   | compensation claim, because it    |
|                                   | will cancel or reduce their       |
