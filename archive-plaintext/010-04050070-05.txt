Example – Rejected Allowable Time Reached (REJ/ATR)

Eli is 27 and previously completed a 4-year Bachelor of Social Work in
2022. Eli was not eligible for Austudy for their previous course. Eli
has lodged an Austudy claim because they are now eligible and about to
start studying a 3-year Bachelor of Science, starting on 26/02/2023.

Taking into account Eli's previous completed 4 year TGB level course,
they have already exceeded their Allowable Time.

To reject the claim Allowable Time Reached (REJ/ATR), code the Allowable
Time End Date: field with the day before the Course Start Date:

-   Course Start Date: 26/02/2023
-   Student Start Date: 26/02/2023
-   Allowable Time End Date: 25/02/2023

Student Programme Resource Tool

The Student Programme Resource Tool contains useful reference
information and links. It includes:

-   Allowable Time Calculator
-   Distance Education & Private Provider Date Calculator
-   Long Term Income Support Calculator

The tool can only be used to assist with Allowable Time Assessments if
all study undertaken at the Institution is studied under the current
Term/Semester structure. If the student has studied at the same
institution under different structures the tool will not be able to
assist with the assessment for study within the previous structure. A
manual allowable time assessment is required.

|                                   | duration of a long course. A      |
|                                   | full-time student may choose to   |
|                                   | do some of the course on a        |
|                                   | part-time basis and vice versa.   |
|                                   | Each section of the course should |
|                                   | be looked at separately if        |
|                                   | possible.                         |

|                                   | Most courses are divided into     |
|                                   | academic periods. The standard    |
|                                   | divisions are:                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   whole years,                  |
|                                   | -   semesters (2 periods per      |
|                                   |     year), or                     |
|                                   | -   trimesters (3 periods per     |
|                                   |     year)                         |

|                                   | It is easy to look at each period |
|                                   | separately in these cases but     |
|                                   | some courses, particularly those  |
|                                   | offered by private providers, do  |
|                                   | not have any divisions. These     |
|                                   | types of courses often have a     |
|                                   | rolling start date (for example,  |
|                                   | the course starts any Monday) and |
|                                   | will finish a set number of weeks |
|                                   | later. In these cases the course  |
|                                   | is looked at as a whole.          |

|                                   | that a student can continue to be |
|                                   | paid up to the point at which     |
|                                   | they should have completed the    |
|                                   | course. For example, a student in |
|                                   | a three year bachelor degree who  |
|                                   | has already completed three and a |
|                                   | half years of study at that level |
|                                   | would be expected to have         |
|                                   | completed the course. The delay   |
|                                   | in completing the course is not   |
|                                   | always the fault of the student.  |
|                                   | For this reason, allowance is     |
|                                   | made to disregard some, or all,   |

|                                   | subtracted from his allowable     |
|                                   | time for his current course. This |
|                                   | leaves John with 0.5 years of     |
|                                   | allowable time to complete his    |
|                                   | Bachelor of Business degree.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Once John has exceeded 0.5 years  |
|                                   | of allowable time, the decision   |
|                                   | cannot be reviewed at a later     |
|                                   | date to disregard the previous    |
|                                   | study. For example, if another    |
|                                   | claim is lodged while still       |
|                                   | undertaking the same course, the  |
|                                   | allowable time calculation cannot |
|                                   | be reset. This means John is      |
|                                   | payable up to the day before he   |
|                                   | commences semester 1, in 2016, as |
|                                   | John would not have exceeded      |
|                                   | allowable time at the             |
|                                   | commencement of semester 2, 2015. |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To calculate the total amount of  |
|                                   | study for a number of academic    |
|                                   | periods it is easiest to measure  |
|                                   | each period as a percentage of a  |
|                                   | whole academic year. Therefore,   |
|                                   | typically a semester's full-time  |
|                                   | study load would equal 50% of a   |
|                                   | year, a trimester's 33.3% and so  |
|                                   | on. If the study in a period was  |
|                                   | part-time then the appropriate    |
|                                   | fraction would be used (for       |
|                                   | example, a student undertakes two |
|                                   | subjects out of the usual four in |
|                                   | a semester - this would equal 25% |
|                                   | of a full years study). The study |
|                                   | load percentage for a specific    |
|                                   | study period may vary depending   |
|                                   | on how the institution structures |
|                                   | their enrolments. Therefore, it   |
|                                   | is important to check the         |
|                                   | National Course Approvals         |
|                                   | sub-site to confirm the relevant  |
|                                   | course structure.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, where an institution |
|                                   | offers 3 trimesters in a year,    |
|                                   | but the third period is optional, |
|                                   | the full-time study load may be   |
|                                   | 50% for trimester 1 and 50% for   |
|                                   | trimester 2.                      |

|                                   | Note: a student who is            |
|                                   | undertaking at least 75% of the   |
|                                   | normal study load (or 66% if a    |
|                                   | study load concession has been    |
|                                   | granted) in a period is           |
|                                   | considered to be a full-time      |
|                                   | student for payment purposes.     |
|                                   | They would also be counted as a   |
|                                   | full-time student for previous    |
|                                   | study calculations. For example,  |
|                                   | a study load of four of the       |
|                                   | normal five subjects in a         |
|                                   | semester is counted as 50% of the |
|                                   | year's study load (not 40%). If a |
|                                   | customer overloads in a semester  |
|                                   | or year, it is counted as 50%     |
|                                   | (0.5) or 100% (1.0) respectively, |
|                                   | and not the overload figure. For  |
|                                   | example, if a customer undertook  |
|                                   | 125% of the normal full-time      |
|                                   | workload in a year, it is counted |
|                                   | as 100% (1.0) of the workload.    |

|                                   | for at least some of their        |

|                                   | Where a student previously        |
|                                   | undertook a 25% concessional      |
|                                   | study load, this study is taken   |
|                                   | to be equal to the minimum time   |
|                                   | it would have taken a full-time   |
|                                   | student to complete it.           |
|                                   | Therefore, six subjects taken     |
|                                   | over two years would be counted   |
|                                   | as one and a half four-subject    |
|                                   | semesters (or 75% of a full years |

|                                   | The allowable time for a combined |
|                                   | Bachelor/Master’s degree should   |
|                                   | be based on the minimum duration  |
|                                   | of the combined degree.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, a combined Bachelor  |

|                                   | Medicine at Murdoch University    |
|                                   | has a minimum duration of 5 years |
|                                   | so the allowable time would be    |
|                                   | 5.5 years. The combined degree is |
|                                   | not split into the Bachelor’s     |
|                                   | component and the Master’s        |
|                                   | component. To determine           |
|                                   | satisfactory progress compare     |
|                                   | time spent at any course that is  |
|                                   | Level B and Level M against the   |
|                                   | allowable time for the entire     |
|                                   | combined course.                  |
