|                                   | management’ approach. They are    |
|                                   | commonly used by processing staff |
|                                   | for a claim to be Held to User.   |

|                                   | need to first create a            |
|                                   | relationship profile. Once a      |
|                                   | profile has been created, it can  |
|                                   | be used for relationships with    |
|                                   | multiple customers.               |

|                                   | mandatory. This allows staff to   |

|                                   | for use with Hold to User.        |
