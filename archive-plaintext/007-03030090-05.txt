Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) status is No

Care must be taken to avoid releasing information about claims and
payments when:

-   a customer and their new partner are both current and/or claiming
    family payments (FTB and CCS), and
-   one, or both, has a Person Permitted to Enquire status of No

When contacting each member of the couple, discuss the following:

If they are aware of whether or not their partner is receiving, or
intending to claim, FTB or CCS for the family

If they are, they will need to discuss their options with each other,
such as:

-   will FTB be claimed by both members of the couple as a blended
    family, or
-   which member of the couple will receive FTB and/or CCS for the
    entire family

Both members of the couple need to advise Services Australia of their
claim choices before any changes can be made

The benefits of giving their partner permission to enquire. Tell them
this will also maximise the use of both their, and their partner's,
information on record for any future claims or interactions
