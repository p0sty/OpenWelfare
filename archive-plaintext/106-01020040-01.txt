This document outlines Community Language Allowance (CLA), which may be
paid to Services Australia employees who assist customers in a language
other than English.

CLA

Staff who speak a language other than English in the course of their
work, may be eligible to receive Community Language Allowance (CLA).

CLA is available for staff who:

-   speak international languages
-   speak Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander languages
-   assist customers who are deaf or hard of hearing, using Auslan and
    other sign languages

Note: CLA does not replace existing interpreting services provided by
the agency.

CLA duties

Staff receiving CLA can:

-   conduct their usual customer contacts in a language other than
    English
-   be the first point of contact for customers who require language
    assistance
-   assist other staff with brief customer interactions, for example
    advising a customer of an appointment or directing them to the
    correct queue

Staff receiving CLA cannot:

-   be expected to handle queries in areas unrelated to their role
-   be used as an interpreter in a three-way conversation
-   assist customers or staff with translating written material
-   use their language skills in situations that exceed their skill
    level. If this occurs, they must engage with an interpreter
