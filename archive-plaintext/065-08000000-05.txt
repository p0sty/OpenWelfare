Compound interest calculation

Compound interest:

-   automatically calculates in the customer’s regular fortnightly
    automatic review
-   calculates each day, based on the balance ((Principal + Interest
    from the last entitlement period) + Costs) on the day

Interest compounds at the end of the entitlement period, and adds to the
interest balance at the end of the entitlement period calculation

HEAS advances are added to the Principal, and accrue interest from the
Date of Event they are delivered

Repayments reduce the balance, and interest is adjusted from the day
they are allocated to the legacy system

Payments made via the Payment Adjustment (PYAJ) screen and/or arrears
payments are added to the Principal at the end of the entitlement
period. Interest accrues from the end of the entitlement period

Calculation

-   Add the accrued Principal, Interest and Costs
-   Less repayments made
-   Multiply by the interest rate, and
-   Divide by 364

Interest for a Day = (Principal + Costs + Interest) – Repayments) x
Interest Rate/364

Interest calculates using the previous Entitlement Period End Dates
(EPED) balance for first 13 days. Then adding the fortnightly payment on
day 14 of the EPED to complete the fortnight’s interest calculation. If
there is no fortnightly LON component, each day calculates based on the
previous balance. The interest is added to the total loan balance on a
fortnightly basis..

|                                   | against property that is counted  |
|                                   | in the assets test.               |

Examples - the HEAS fortnightly loan amounts and advance payable

Table 4: this table provides examples of the fortnightly HEAS loan
payments (LON component) and lump sum advance payments (LONA component).
See Advance payments for Home Equity Access Scheme (HEAS) loans for more
details.

The Maximum Pension Rate (MPR) is the sum of the maximum basic rate of
pension, and Pension Supplement, Energy Supplement and Rent Assistance
(RA) the customer is eligible for under the Pension Rate Calculator. RA
paid with Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is not included in the maximum
payment rate for the HEAS purposes.

The maximum HEAS rate is 1.5 times the MPR (150% equivalent).

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.
