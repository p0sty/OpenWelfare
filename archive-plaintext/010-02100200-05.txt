|                                   | During the school term, Leila     |

|                                   | in Mount Marshall to the Gold     |
|                                   | Coast, via Ipswich Girls Grammar  |
|                                   | to pick up Leila. Leila and Jared |
|                                   | will stay 4 nights on the Gold    |
|                                   | Coast to participate in the       |
|                                   | event. They will then travel back |
|                                   | to Mount Marshall via Ipswich     |
|                                   | Girl Grammar to drop Leila back   |
|                                   | at the term address.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Leila is representing the      |
|                                   | school or attending a school      |
|                                   | related activity at a location    |
|                                   | other than the term address, we   |
|                                   | regard it as a temporary change   |
|                                   | in study location. The study      |
|                                   | location is considered to have    |
|                                   | changed temporarily to the Gold   |
|                                   | Coast. Jared would be eligible    |
|                                   | for FAA Special Purpose Travel to |
|                                   | attend the event on the Gold      |
|                                   | Coast. In this scenario, it is    |
|                                   | Jared who is the approved ABSTUDY |
|                                   | traveller.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the permanent home is in Mount |
|                                   | Marshall and the event is on the  |
|                                   | Gold Coast, the major routes      |
|                                   | between these locations pass      |
|                                   | through Ipswich, so it is         |
|                                   | reasonable and practical for      |
|                                   | Jared and Leila to travel         |
|                                   | together in the same vehicle.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When they reach the Gold Coast,   |
|                                   | Jared would be eligible for FAA   |
|                                   | to cover accommodation during the |
|                                   | event, however Leila's            |
|                                   | accommodation is not covered      |
|                                   | under FAA.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | While it may be reasonable for    |
|                                   | Leila and Jared to share          |
|                                   | accommodation while at the Gold   |
|                                   | Coast, if there is an additional  |
|                                   | charge for Leila to share the     |
|                                   | accommodation with Jared, this    |
|                                   | additional charge will not be     |
|                                   | covered by FAA.                   |
