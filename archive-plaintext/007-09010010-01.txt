PPL/DAP details for customers with children born or entering care before
1 July 2023 only.

This document outlines what to do when a claim for Parental Leave Pay
(PPL) has been processed with an incorrect nominated start date and
payment has already been issued.

Administrative error

This procedure should only be used when an administrative error has
occurred and not where the customer has requested a change to their
nominated start date after any PPL has been delivered. A separate
procedure applies if the customer requests a reassessment of their PPL
claim.

Debt raising

Any PPL issued to the employee or employer will be raised as a debt.
Before commencing this procedure the customer must be advised of this so
they are able to make an informed decision about whether they would like
to have the nominated start date corrected.
