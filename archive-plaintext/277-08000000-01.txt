Government intent

In 1988, the Australian Government introduced the child support scheme
to assist separated parents to take responsibility for the financial
support of their children. The Child Support Registrar administers the
child support scheme.

Services Australia delivers the services and payments provided by Child
Support, Medicare, and Centrelink. Child Support is a service delivery
brand within Services Australia.

The child support scheme involves the assessment of child support in
accordance with a formula as well as the collection and enforcement of
court orders, child support agreements and child support assessments.
