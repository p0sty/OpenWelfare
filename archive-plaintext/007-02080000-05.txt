|                                   | Celeste is an Australian resident |

|                                   | absence of 44 weeks. On 15        |
|                                   | August, Celeste gives birth to a  |
|                                   | child and becomes eligible for    |
|                                   | PPL. On 1 September of the same   |

|                                   | Australia temporarily.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Celeste returned to Australia for |
|                                   | less than 6 weeks (from 1 August  |
|                                   | to 1 September) and is deemed to  |

|                                   | The 56 weeks will expire on the   |
|                                   | 24 October. If Celeste is still   |
|                                   | overseas at this time, PPL will   |
|                                   | cease on this day and cannot be   |
|                                   | restored or reclaimed for the     |

|                                   | If Celeste remains in Australia   |
|                                   | from 1 August to 12 September, it |
|                                   | is deemed to have been a return   |
|                                   | to Australia as the return period |
|                                   | is greater than 6 weeks. In this  |
|                                   | case, a new 56 week period of     |
|                                   | absence starts on 12 September.   |
