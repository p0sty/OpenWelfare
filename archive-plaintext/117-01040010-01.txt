This document explains how to record a clearance request for customers
who are receiving, or may be eligible to receive payments of
compensation.

Compensation

Compensation is defined under Section 17(2) if the Social Security Act
1991 as a payment that is made wholly or partly in respect of lost
earnings or lost capacity to earn resulting from personal injury (this
includes a disease or condition), whether paid as a lump sum or periodic
payments (either within or outside Australia), including payments:

-   of damages
-   under a scheme of insurance of compensation under a Commonwealth,
    state or territory law, including a payment under a contract entered
    into under such a scheme
-   in settlement (with or without admission of liability) of a claim
    for damages or a claim under such an insurance scheme, or
-   for any other compensation or damages

Some payments may be treated as a compensation payment, or assessed as
ordinary unearned income depending on the terms of the policy, made
under:

-   an income replacement policy
-   sickness and accident policy or
-   for sporting injuries

Clearances are required for criminal injury compensation claims. The
Compensation Recovery Team (CRT) will determine how to treat the
compensation payment.

Payments not treated as compensation should not be recorded on the
Compensation Management System (CMS). Many payments commonly called
compensation do not meet the definition of compensation under Social
Security Law. These include:

-   income protection policies attached to superannuation policies
-   payments made to 'victims of crime' by victims compensation schemes
-   Thalidomide Class Action payments
-   National Redress Scheme

Compensation recovery provisions

When a person or their partner has, or may have, suffered an economic
loss as a result of personal injury, a Compensation Affect Payment (CAP)
may not be payable if they, or their partner:

-   have a potential or actual compensation entitlement, and
-   do not take reasonable action to obtain that compensation, or
-   have received compensation, and
-   they are serving a preclusion period

Generally, a person who is unable to work because of a compensable
injury cannot receive for the same period of time:

-   compensation payments from a compensation payer, and
-   a CAP from Services Australia

This ensures that those with primary responsibility, will provide
compensation payments to the injured person (for example, weekly
compensation payments paid to a person who was injured at work also
referred to as workers compensation).

MOD C

When a customer has an injury it is a requirement for them or their
partner to pursue and obtain compensation they are eligible to receive.

Get this information:

-   verbally during the customer contact
-   via the Module C (MOD C) form

The MOD C can be:

-   downloaded online
-   issued manually
-   submitted online along with any supporting documents within 14 days

The customer will need to complete a separate MOD C for each
compensation injury or claim.

This information is recorded in the Compensation Management Summary.

CAP

A customer who is receiving a compensation affected payment (CAP) may
continue to receive their CAP pending an assessment from the
Compensation Recovery Team (CRT).

A new claim for a CAP cannot be finalised until a clearance is received
from the CRT. Staff should only request compensation clearances if the
customer has met all basic qualification criteria.

Request a new compensation clearance from CRT if the customer:

-   requests a reassessment of a rejected CAP claim, and
-   is assessed as qualified

Different rules apply to:

-   ABSTUDY for the treatment of compensation
-   ABSTUDY Pension Education Supplement (PES) and when it is assessed
    as a CAP

more details on Compensation Recovery Teams.
