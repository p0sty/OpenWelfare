Troubleshooting RFM51 Medicare linking issue

When Medicare links to myGov, a number is stored in CDMS to prove a
customer is linked to online services. This number is called an MBUN
(Meaningful But Useless Number). This number is stored in CDMS under the
MBUN tab with date and time it was linked.

To resolve this error, Service Officers need to check the customer MBUN
reference in CDMS.
