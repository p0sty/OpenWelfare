Person Permitted to Enquire (PPE) status is No

Care must be taken to avoid releasing information about claims and
payments when:

-   a customer and their new partner are both current and/or claiming
    family payments (FTB and CCS), and
-   one, or both, has a Person Permitted to Enquire status of No

When contacting each member of the couple, discuss the following:

If they are aware of whether or not their partner is receiving, or
intending to claim, FTB or CCS for the family

If they are, they will need to discuss their options with each other,
such as:

-   will FTB be claimed by both members of the couple as a blended
    family, or
-   which member of the couple will receive FTB and/or CCS for the
    entire family

Both members of the couple need to advise Services Australia of their
claim choices before any changes can be made

The benefits of giving their partner permission to enquire. Tell them
this will also maximise the use of both their, and their partner's,
information on record for any future claims or interactions

P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios:

-   A step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has been
    transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB (for example,
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%) and they make a
    claim
-   The biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and they
    later separate. Care details for the child will not be transferred
    correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh is
    requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on
the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and
the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Resources page of
Assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for
further information.
