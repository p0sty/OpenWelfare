|                                   | Note: Josef is a PPV holder       |
|                                   | granted SpB before 1 January 2012 |
|                                   | based on being exempt from the    |

|                                   | Period (NARWP) as the partner is  |
|                                   | an Australian citizen.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, if Josef does not return |
|                                   | within 13 weeks of the payment    |
|                                   | stopping, Josef must lodge a new  |
|                                   | claim.                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The change in legislation on 1    |
|                                   | January 2012 means Josef will no  |
|                                   | longer be exempt from the NARWP   |
|                                   | for this reason.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Josef will therefore have to wait |
|                                   | until serving the current NARWP   |
|                                   | as the holder of a PPV residing   |
|                                   | in and in Australia.              |

|                                   | Alternatively, Josef may possibly |
|                                   | satisfy another reason allowing   |
|                                   | an exemption from the NARWP (for  |
