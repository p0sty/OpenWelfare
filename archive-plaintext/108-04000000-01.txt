This document outlines how to assess assets for social security pensions
and benefits.

Government intent

Services Australia provides easy, high quality services to people at
different stages of their lives through the Medicare, Centrelink and
Child Support programs. In order to provide income support to those in
need, assets are assessed for the purposes of obtaining a pension or
benefit. Most assets are assessed, however some are exempt.

Effect on payments

An Assets test assessment affects a customer's payment rate components
in the following order:

-   basic rate
-   Pension Supplement Basic Amount (where applicable)
-   the remaining amount (where applicable)
-   Rent Assistance (RA)
-   Pension Supplement Minimum Amount (where applicable)
-   Pharmaceutical Allowance (PhA) (where applicable)

Sale of assets

The cash proceeds received by a customer due to the sale of an asset are
not assessed as income, including any capital gains achieved, for
example, a garage sale, or firearms buyback scheme. The customer's
assessable assets may need adjusting due to the sale. Any proceeds of
cash or extra in financial accounts are subject to the usual deeming
provisions. Customers selling their principal home may be treated
differently.

Where there is a small change to asset values determine whether the
customer is required to notify.

(SA220m) form.
