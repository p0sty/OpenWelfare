|                                   | A payee can make an AFC verbally  |
|                                   | or in writing (AFC form). If the  |
|                                   | payee resides overseas, they can  |
|                                   | lodge an AFC personally or it can |
|                                   | be lodged on their behalf by an   |

|                                   | customers. For example, if the    |

|                                   | through discussions with both     |

|                                   | also paid to the payee for child  |

|                                   | for, the claimed opt in arrears   |

|                                   | would be adjusted to $300.        |
