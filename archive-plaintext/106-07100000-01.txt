This document outlines the most commonly issued Centrelink forms.
Information collected on the form is transferred to the customer's
record and used in determining a customer's entitlement to payments and
services.

Modules

Some of the more commonly issued forms are called modules and are
designed to gather specific information about a customer's
circumstances.

For example most income support payments are asset tested. The Mod iA
collects information on the customer's assets. This information is then
recorded and an automatic assessment occurs to check that the customer's
assets are below the applicable asset threshold.

Information collection methods

When customers wish to make a new claim, the information in some of the
modules can be collected either, verbally during the customer's contact
with Centrelink, such as the Staff Assisted Claim (SAC), or via the
paper form. Regardless of the channel used, the details of the specific
module and how that information was gathered must be clearly recorded on
a DOC on the customer's record.
