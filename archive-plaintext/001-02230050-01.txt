This document outlines the mutual obligation requirements for job
seekers claiming or receiving payment with mutual obligation
requirements who have an illness, injury or disability.

Exemption from mutual obligation requirements and attending appointments

Job seekers who have been granted an exemption from their mutual
obligation requirements, including those customers with a serious
illness are exempt from having to meet their mutual obligation
requirements for the duration of their exemption.

Job seekers are expected to attend appointments with Services Australia,
and to make contact with Services Australia where they are unable to
attend an appointment in person. If the customer has an exemption from
mutual obligation requirements due to a serious illness, consider their
ability to attend an appointment in person or whether to conduct the
interview over the phone.

Job seekers assessed by an Employment Services Assessment (ESAt) as
having a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced work capacity
will have part-time mutual obligation requirements.

Participation requirements for job seekers with reduced capacity

Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced work
capacity will have the following mutual obligation requirements, in
accordance with their work capacity as assessed by an ESAt:

-   Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced
    work capacity of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week who are receiving a
    payment with mutual obligation requirements such as JobSeeker
    Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) are required to
    attend the quarterly contacts with Services Australia to discuss
    their participation. These job seekers can be referred to an
    Employment Services Provider on a voluntary basis
-   Job seekers with a partial capacity to work of between 15-22 hours
    per week will be required to look for work or undertake work of
    15-22 hours per week. They may be required to accept an offer of
    paid work, provided the work is not unsuitable to satisfy their
    mutual obligation requirements. They will satisfy their mutual
    obligation requirements if they are working at least 15 hours per
    week
-   Job seekers with a partial capacity to work or temporary reduced
    work capacity of between 23-29 hours per week will be required to
    look for work or undertake work of 23-29 hours per week and will be
    required to accept work within this range, provided the work is not
    unsuitable. However they will satisfy their mutual obligation
    requirements if they are working at least 15 hours per week
