A guide to Organisation Naming Conventions

ESOs must follow the naming convention to create new organisations.
Using the naming convention helps:

-   service officers and ESOs locate the organisation in Cuba
-   reduce the creation of duplicate records Note: Service Officers must
    not create organisations on Cuba.

If a new organisation is needed for:

-   a linking request, refer to Service Officer role in setting up
    employer withholding (EW) linking
-   any other reason, use the Add attributes request macro to request a
    new organisation be created

ESOs need to update the organisation details if they find it has not
been entered as per the naming convention.

If a Service Officer finds an incorrect organisation name, they need to
refer the details to the owning ESO via an intray. In the intray
notepad, include details to help the ESO investigate and correct the
organisations name.

How to enter organisation names on Cuba (ESO)

The 'legal name' section of Cuba must contain the correct legal name of
the organisation.

ESOs must check ATO systems to confirm the legal name of the
organisation before:

-   creating a new Child Support Reference Number (CSRN), or
-   updating an organisation name

They can also cross reference organisation names using 'ABN look up'.

Failure to record the correct legal name can have a detrimental effect
on collection of child support via employer withholding, including
prosecution and/or litigation action.

Organisations may use a different trading name to their legal name. ESOs
must ensure that legal names and trading names are recorded in the
correct fields in Cuba.

The title of the primary contact should be added via the organisation
contact details window. In most instances, this will be updated to the
Payroll Officer but in instances of continuing noncompliance it should
be updated to the correct legal primary contact.

| 15                                | Trusts                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In legal terms, a trust is a      |
|                                   | relationship and not a legal      |
|                                   | entity. If a trust employs        |
|                                   | people, the trustee will have     |
|                                   | employer obligations including    |
|                                   | pay as you go (PAYG) withholding, |
|                                   | super contributions for eligible  |
|                                   | employees, and reporting and      |
|                                   | paying tax on fringe benefits.    |
|                                   | The trustee will also be required |
|                                   | to make child support deductions, |
|                                   | therefore it is vital that names  |
|                                   | of trusts are recorded correctly. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The preference is for the trust's |
|                                   | full name to be entered where     |
|                                   | possible.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where Cuba will not allow for the |
|                                   | full name of the trust to be      |
|                                   | entered, for example 'Bill Burke  |
|                                   | as the trustee to the Burke       |
|                                   | Family Trust', this can be        |
|                                   | shortened to 'The trustee to the  |
|                                   | Burke Family Trust', with the     |
|                                   | understanding that the trust      |
|                                   | itself should be able to identify |
|                                   | the trustee.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Occasionally a trust name in ATO  |
|                                   | systems or ABN look up makes no   |
|                                   | mention of a 'Trustee'. The       |
|                                   | following wording must be         |
|                                   | included at the front of the      |
|                                   | trust name: 'Trustee for the      |
|                                   | XXXX' This ensures letters and    |
|                                   | schedules are addressed to the    |
|                                   | correct legal entity.             |

|                                   | It is common for 'as trustee for' |
|                                   | to be written 'ATF' or ‘The       |
|                                   | trustee for’ to be written ‘TTF’. |
