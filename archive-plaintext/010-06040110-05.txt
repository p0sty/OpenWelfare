|                                   | May is a gifted dancer who lives  |
|                                   | in Canberra. The local secondary  |
|                                   | does not provide facilities or an |
|                                   | educational focus for dance. May  |
|                                   | wishes to bypass the local        |
|                                   | secondary school in order to      |
|                                   | attend the Victorian School of    |
|                                   | Ballet. May's school principal,   |
|                                   | teachers and members of the arts  |
|                                   | community (who have connections   |
|                                   | with the school) have provided    |
|                                   | statements identifying attendance |
|                                   | at the non-local school will be   |
|                                   | beneficial in the development of  |
|                                   | May's special talent.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | May would be eligible to bypass   |
|                                   | the local secondary school as has |
|                                   | demonstrated it is beneficial to  |
|                                   | education and/or employment       |
|                                   | prospects. As May would have to   |
|                                   | move to another state to attend,  |
|                                   | May would qualify for the away    |
|                                   | from home rate of YA.             |
