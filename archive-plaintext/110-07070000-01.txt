This document outlines the process to be followed for End of Year (EOY)
reviews for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC).

AIC EOY review

The EOY review for AIC is an annual circumstance review that:

-   is for all applicants, and
-   includes a parental income review for applicants who receive
    Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA). This determines the level of
    ABA payable for the following year for students who are boarding

An income review is not required if an applicant or their partner:

-   is on an income support type payment, or
-   holds a current Health Care Card issued to families in receipt of
    the maximum rate of FTB part A

This is because they have a Parental Income Test (PIT) exemption
verified through an existing PIT link.

Applicants receive the reviews in late October to confirm a student's
entitlement to payments for the following year.

The EOY review:

-   verifies a student's education details and their living arrangements
-   asks if a student’s isolation or other eligibility details have
    changed
-   asks the applicant to advise their (and their partner's) new
    financial year income

The applicant may be required to provide evidence for:

-   special needs students with short-term health-related needs, or
-   those with a deemed isolation circumstance

Students not selected for a review

The following students are not required to complete the EOY review:

-   AIC Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) students will be reviewed
    individually by AIC Smart Centre staff
-   Students who are current with a future cancellation date of other
    than 1 January next calendar year
-   Students completing Years 12 or 13
-   Students who will be over the maximum AIC age by 1 January of the
    following year

Failure to respond

If applicants do not respond to the review, payments will be cancelled
from 1 January of the following year. However, if the review is lodged
by 1 March in the year following that for which the EOY review applies
and the student is eligible, payments can be restored from 1 January for
that year.
