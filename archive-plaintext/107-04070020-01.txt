This document outlines how to apportion Parental Leave Pay (PPL) debts
and who is responsible for repaying the debt.

Debt liability

Overpaid amounts of PPL are recoverable. This includes amounts paid
resulting from administrative error.

A PPL debt may be raised against:

-   the employer
-   the employee, or
-   both employee and employer

If an employee gets PPL from their employer, and they return to work,
they are no longer eligible for PPL. If Services Australia is not
informed, the employer will continue to get the employee's PPL payments.

Whoever holds the PPL funds will be responsible for repaying the debt.

-   The employer will have a debt raised for any PPL they have not yet
    paid to the employee
-   The employee will have a debt for any PPL they have received.
    Amounts deducted for Pay As You Go (PAYG) or other reasons will be
    included in the debt to the employee
