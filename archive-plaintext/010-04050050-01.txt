This document outlines the assessment of eligibility for the 25%
concessional study load. This concession applies to Austudy students who
have a substantial physical, psychiatric or intellectual disability.

Definition of full-time

The Austudy activity test requires that a customer be enrolled in and
undertaking an approved course of study at an approved educational
institution on a full-time basis. 'Full-time' is defined as at least 75%
of the normal study load in the course. However, a concession to this
full-time study load requirement may be approved in some circumstances.

Study load concession

There are two types of full-time study load concessions for Austudy with
two different sets of eligibility criteria. They are:

-   a 25% concessional study load
-   a 66% concessional study load

Secondary and tertiary students can undertake between 25% and 74% of the
normal full-time study load for the course and still qualify for Austudy
under the 25% concessional study load rule, if they:

-   have a substantial physical, psychiatric or intellectual disability,
    and
-   are unable to study full-time because of this disability

The 25% study load concession is granted with respect to a specific
course at a specific time. Some courses are less demanding than others
and so a student may be able to undertake a full study load in one
course but not in another. The customer's level of disability may also
vary with time. Therefore, previous approval or rejection of this
concession must not be considered to be permanent approval or rejection.

Note: the 25% concessional study-load does not apply to YA recipients.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
