Payment returned because of incorrect bank details

Incorrect workflow used by staff

Do not follow this process if:

the customer lodged a claim for the incorrect event/relevant period and
a decision has not been made

-   those claims should be rejected

a customer's payment rate needs to change following an explanation of a
decision (review) process

-   see COVID-19 Disaster Payment - review process

the customer wants to return a payment they have already received

-   see COVID-19 Disaster Payment claim or automatic payment - customer
    calls to enquire

If there is an error with an automatic payment, see COVID-19 Disaster
Payment - automatic payment and change of circumstances. This tells
staff when to follow certain steps in this process.

Table 1: process to follow when the incorrect workflow was run by staff
or the customer was not eligible to receive a payment.
