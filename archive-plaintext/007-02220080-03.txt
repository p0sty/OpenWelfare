This page contains a list of cancellation, suspension and rejection
codes that may be used for Parenting Payment (PP). The list of reason
codes is preceded by a legend explaining the codes

Some codes do not apply to both Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) and
Parenting Payment Single (PPS). In other cases, the code may apply to
both but details may differ between PPP and PPS, so separate details are
provided for each payment type.

If considering restoring PP, see Restoration of Parenting Payment (PP).

|                                   | Suspensions can be manually       |
|                                   | restored where there is a gap in  |

|                                   | In such cases, their payment      |
|                                   | should be suspended.              |

|                                   | An automatic review will cancel   |
|                                   | payment if it remains suspended   |
|                                   | for 84 days.                      |

| Cancellation (CAN)                | Cancelled records can sometimes   |
|                                   | be manually or automatically      |

|                                   | restored for all cancellation     |
|                                   | reasons if it is more than 13     |
|                                   | weeks since notice of             |

|                                   | Before cancelling a customer's    |
|                                   | payment, care should be taken to  |
|                                   | establish that the customer has   |
|                                   | lost entitlement for that         |
|                                   | payment.                          |

|                                   | When an unfavourable decision is  |
|                                   | to be made, a Decision Maker (DM) |
|                                   | must provide the customer with an |
|                                   | explanation of the decision and   |
|                                   | an opportunity to provide further |
|                                   | information or evidence relevant  |
|                                   | to the decision. The DM must also |
|                                   | advise the customer of their      |
|                                   | review rights and if required,    |
|                                   | record a request for a review of  |
|                                   | the decision. This includes       |
|                                   | unfavourable decisions made by    |
|                                   | Service Officers in Smart         |

|                                   | If a DM is not speaking with a    |

|                                   | a customer by phone prior to      |
|                                   | finalising an unfavourable        |
