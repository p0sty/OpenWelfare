|                                   | Answer: This depends on your      |
|                                   | airline or the country you’re     |
|                                   | visiting. Some may accept digital |
|                                   | copies but it’s recommended you   |
|                                   | carry printed ones too. You       |
|                                   | should check with your airline    |
|                                   | and the countries you plan on     |
|                                   | visiting.                         |

|                                   | Answer: No, your certificate      |
|                                   | isn’t linked to a database.       |

|                                   | from my International COVID-19    |
|                                   | Vaccination certificate?          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No but they both use the  |
|                                   | same technology. When you get     |
|                                   | your certificate nothing happens  |
|                                   | to your passport chip, they’re    |
|                                   | not linked. You’ll need to use    |
|                                   | both as separate documents when   |
|                                   | travelling overseas.              |

|                                   | letter saying they need to update |
|                                   | their COVID-19 vaccination        |
|                                   | details because it is missing the |
|                                   | country code. Can you please give |
|                                   | me more information?              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: There are a few reasons   |
|                                   | for this. It may be because the   |
|                                   | patient’s vaccination was         |
|                                   | recorded before the international |

|                                   | early to avoid delays in getting  |
|                                   | their proof of vaccination once   |

| 18                                | Question: When requesting an      |
|                                   | international certificate for a   |
|                                   | customer, can I update the middle |
