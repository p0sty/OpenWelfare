Care levels table

Table 1: this table identifies the care terms for different care
percentage ranges and the number of nights in a year that equates to the
care level. See the Child Support Guide 2.2.1: Basics of care.

Cost percentage table

Table 2: this table has information relating to a parent's or non-parent
carer's cost percentage represents the percentage of a child's costs the
person meets directly through care. The cost percentage is determined
according to the person's percentage of care, using the cost percentages
table (section 55C). See the Child Support Guide 2.4.5: Care, cost and
child support percentages.

2024 Costs of children

Costs of children tables are published each calendar year for
assessments for child support periods starting in that calendar year.

The columns of the tables identify different parental income levels and
the costs of children for that level:

-   child support formulas 1, 2, 3 and 4 use the parents' combined child
    support income to calculate the costs of children
-   child support formulas 5 and 6 use only one parent's income to
    determine the costs of children
-   the last column is used to calculate the costs of children if income
    is greater than 2.5 times MTAWE, that is, costs are capped at that
    amount

Ages of the children

Separate tables based on the ages of the children identify the costs of
those children for the parental income level:

all children aged 0-12 years, or

all children aged 13+ years, or

children of mixed age where at least 1 child is aged 0-12 years and 1
child aged 13+ years.
Mixed age amounts are used when:

-   calculating the costs of a child using the basic formula method, or
-   the costs of a relevant dependent child

The costs of children for a day in a child support period are calculated
by identifying the ages of the children for that day. If a child will
turn 13 within the child support period, costs are calculated
differently for the periods before and after the child's 13^(th)
birthday.

Number of children

The ranges (rows) for the number of children are 1, 2 and 3 or more.
That is, for 4 or more children, the same costs apply as for 3 children.
Use the ages of the 3 oldest children to calculate costs for more than 3
children.

For more information, see the Child Support Guide 2.4.4: Child support
income and 2.4.6: The costs of the child.
