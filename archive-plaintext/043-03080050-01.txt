This document outlines the steps required to assess an interim balance
sheet provided by a customer for a business in which they have an
interest.

Purpose of the interim balance sheet

Centrelink requires an interim balance sheet to assess assets of a
business for a customer when they are claiming a pension, benefit or
allowance. A balance sheet provides a snapshot of the financial position
of an entity at a point in time, showing the values of the assets and
liabilities of the business at a particular date. Note: customers must
also provide a profit and loss statement.

Service Officers and Complex Assessment Officers (CAOs):

-   are not expected to fulfil the role of accountants for customers,
    and
-   should not attempt to undertake the calculation of the net value of
    a business from the books of accounts

Contents of the interim balance sheet

Items that need to be checked and/or adjusted include:

-   assets exempt from assessment
-   that the values on the balance sheet are the current market value of
    assets
-   no double counting of assets - where an asset is counted as both a
    personal asset of the customer and as an asset of the business
-   an excluded security
-   apportionment of liabilities secured over both exempt and assessable
    assets
-   aggregation of primary production assets and liabilities

Service Officers and CAOs must use the correct date of event for
business income and assets.
