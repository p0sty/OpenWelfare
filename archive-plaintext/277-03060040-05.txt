+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Example 1                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly advises that Ron has been   |
|                                   | in care 100% of the time since 23 |
|                                   | July 2021 as Trent (the other     |
|                                   | customer) has moved interstate.   |
|                                   | There is no care arrangement in   |
|                                   | place. Trent is contacted and     |
|                                   | agrees that Ron’s care has        |
|                                   | changed, but states that the care |
|                                   | could not have changed on 23 July |
|                                   | 2021 because that was Trent's     |
|                                   | birthday weekend and remembers    |
|                                   | caring for Ron for the entire     |
|                                   | weekend and returning Ron to      |
|                                   | Nelly’s house on Monday 26 July   |
|                                   | 2021. Trent also claims that      |
|                                   | plans have been made to take Ron  |
|                                   | overseas for 8 weeks during the   |
|                                   | 2021 Christmas holidays. Trent    |
|                                   | advises that during the care      |
|                                   | period expects to care for Ron    |
|                                   | for 56 nights (15%).              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nelly is contacted again to       |
|                                   | discuss Trent’s claims. During    |
|                                   | the conversation, Nelly recalls   |
|                                   | the birthday weekend and confirms |
|                                   | the care changed on 26 July 2021. |
|                                   | Nelly also agrees that Trent is   |
|                                   | taking Ron overseas for 8 weeks   |
|                                   | over Christmas to see family.     |
|                                   | Nelly also explains that during   |
|                                   | the initial contact, as the       |
|                                   | overseas trip was a one-off event |
|                                   | and not a permanent change, this  |
|                                   | was not included in the original  |
|                                   | notification. In this event, care |
|                                   | would be recorded as 100% care to |
|                                   | Nelly from 23 July 2021.          |

| 2                                 | Example 2                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Kim advises that care for child   |
|                                   | Margot changed on 17 July 2021.   |
|                                   | Zeke (the other customer) advises |
|                                   | that the care changed on 23 July  |
|                                   | 2021. Neither customer can        |
|                                   | provide evidence to support their |
|                                   | claims and nor is one customer’s  |
|                                   | information more compelling than  |
|                                   | the other. The point of agreement |
|                                   | is 23 July 2021 – the first day   |
|                                   | both customers agree that the     |
|                                   | care had changed.                 |
