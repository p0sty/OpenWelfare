| 1                                 | QTD type (QTT) is A               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 4 February 2017 Anja applies   |
|                                   | for SSL for the loan period 1     |
|                                   | January to 30 June 2017 as part   |
|                                   | of a new claim for Austudy.       |
|                                   | Anja's approved scholarship       |
|                                   | course starts on 1 February 2017  |
|                                   | and ends on 30 November 2021.     |
|                                   | Anja has no income. On 21         |
|                                   | February 2017 Austudy is granted, |
|                                   | backdated to 1 February 2017.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Anja meets all the SSL criteria   |
|                                   | on 1 February 2017, so the system |
|                                   | determines Anja is eligible for   |
|                                   | SSL on that day.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The QTD date for this loan will   |
|                                   | be the earliest of:               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the day the Secretary         |
|                                   |     determines the person's claim |
|                                   |     for SSL for the loan period   |
|                                   |     (21 February 2017)            |
|                                   | -    if the approved scholarship  |
|                                   |     course ends in the loan       |
|                                   |     period - the last day of the  |
|                                   |     approved scholarship course   |
|                                   |     (not applicable - course does |
|                                   |     not end during the loan       |
|                                   |     period)                       |
|                                   | -    the last day of the loan     |
|                                   |     period (30 June 2017)         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The earliest of these is 21       |
|                                   | February 2017, so the QTD date    |
|                                   | for this loan is 21 February 2017 |
|                                   | and the QTD type (QTT) is 'A'.    |

| 2                                 | QTD type (QTT) is A               |

|                                   | In February 2016 Byron applied    |
|                                   | for SSL for all loan periods      |
|                                   | during an approved scholarship    |
|                                   | course which starts on 2 March    |
|                                   | 2016 and ends on 30 November      |
|                                   | 2020.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For the loan period from 1 July   |
|                                   | 2016 to 31 December 2016 the      |
|                                   | system will start checking their  |
|                                   | eligibility for SSL on 1 July     |
|                                   | 2016. On that date, Byron's       |
|                                   | income precludes payment, so      |
|                                   | Byron does not meet all the       |
|                                   | criteria for SSL and the system   |
|                                   | will keep checking his SSL        |
|                                   | eligibility until:                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Byron is eligible or          |
|                                   | -    the loan period ends or      |
|                                   | -    the course ends (if the      |
|                                   |     course ends in that loan      |

|                                   | The first date in the loan period |
|                                   | that Byron receives at least $1   |
|                                   | of student payment is 11 August,  |
|                                   | so this is the date the Secretary |
|                                   | (i.e. system) determines Byron is |
|                                   | eligible for SSL for the loan     |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | The QTD date will be the earliest |
