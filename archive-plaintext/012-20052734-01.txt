This document outlines the process of email communication including the
Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) Mail Centre.

Email triage

Email triage is the process of assessing each new message and deciding
what action to take.

It includes managing the volume of emails through the external email
boxes and the HPOS Mail Centres.

HPOS Mail Centre

HPOS Mail Centre is a secure electronic messaging system only accessible
by HPOS account holders and people they nominate.

Only an owner or authorised contact person who registers with PIP/WIP –
Practice Stream can request practice specific details. The RA number
identifies the sender.

The HPOS Mail Centre shows:

-   incoming mail to action
-   archived mail
-   the latest message in the mail thread

The HPOS Mail Centres are:

-   PIP, PIP Mail Centre
-   WIP – Practice Stream, WIP – Practice Stream Mail Centre

See HPOS Support Mail Centre – managing emails from health professionals
for more information.
