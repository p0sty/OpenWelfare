DAP ACS coding

An update may be required to the Accommodation Details (AC) screen when
processing a DAP claim and the customer has advised a change in marital
status. If the AC screen has previously been coded, a new line of AC
coding will be required. The update required to the AC screen depends on
what is already known on the record.
