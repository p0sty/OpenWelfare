This document outlines the procedure to acquit Away from Base allowances
paid in advance for an activity.

Single activity acquittal requirements

Payment in advance can be made for an Away from Base activity based on
estimated costs provided in an ABSTUDY Submission for away from base
activity funding (SY034) form.

The claimant must provide acquittal of an advance payment within one
calendar month of the completion of the approved activity. No funding of
future activities will occur until all previous funding has been
acquitted.

Claimants must:

-   confirm student participation in the approved activity for whom
    residential expenses was paid
-   if the student was unable to participate due to exceptional
    circumstances, provide evidence of the student’s exceptional
    circumstance and
-   provide a Single Activity Acquittal Report form for the acquittal of
    payments made as a residential expenses package. (This form is
    attached to the ABSTUDY Submission for away from base activity
    funding (SY034)) or
-   provide original receipts or audited financial statements should be
    attached to substantiate the acquittal

Bulk funded acquittal requirements

Acquittal of bulk funding requires:

-   the lodgement of an independently audited financial statement, and
-   a declaration certifying the funds have been expended in accordance
    with the agreement

The audited acquittal statement is due by 31 January in the following
year. If not provided, funding of individual or bulk activities will
cease.

Unacquitted portions of an advanced payment will result in an overpaid
amount. Repayment of this amount must occur prior to further approval of
Away from Base funding.
