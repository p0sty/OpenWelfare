This document outlines the stages for negotiating debt repayments with
customers and the key points to consider.

Points to consider

-   The phone is the primary contact method
-   Negotiate the debt as soon as possible after it is raised
-   Negotiate to achieve the best repayment method
-   The preference is payment in full by the due date
-   Only send content letter after genuine attempts at contact by phone
    have failed
-   Send a letter to confirm negotiations

The system will offset debts using tax refunds or lump sum family
assistance payments if the debt is:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB), or
-   Child Care debt

FTB top-ups, lump sum payments or FTB Instalment arrears may also be
used to offset Social Security, Student Assistance or Paid Parental
Leave debts. This can occur even if there is a current repayment
arrangement in place. For more information, see Debt offsetting during
family assistance reassessment, reconciliation and claim processing.

Note: Debt Staff must not encourage or suggest the customer take out a
loan to pay the debt.

Follow quality customer service standards.

Change of address notification

Debt Staff should advise customers they have a legal obligation to
notify within 14 days of any change of address. This is while a debt is
still owing regardless of whether they are current on a payment or not.
Failure to provide an address or financial information (if requested) is
an offence with a penalty.
