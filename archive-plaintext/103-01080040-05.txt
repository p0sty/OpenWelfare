|                                   | -   Anne applies for an exemption |

|                                   |     February 2015 and the         |
|                                   |     delegate applies the          |
|                                   |     financial vulnerability test  |
|                                   | -   Anne does not know how to set |
|                                   |     a budget and advises the      |
|                                   |     delegate that bills are often |
|                                   |     forgotten to be paid. Anne    |
|                                   |     also states that without      |
|                                   |     Income Management the family  |

|                                   | -   Anne has also lost the        |
|                                   |     BasicsCard a number of times  |
|                                   |     and had to get a replacement  |
|                                   |     around the start of December  |

|                                   | -   Based on this information,    |
|                                   |     the delegate determines that  |
|                                   |     Anne is financially           |
|                                   |     vulnerable, and does not      |
|                                   |     grant Anne an exemption       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As there is no clear indicator of |
|                                   | financial vulnerability (FV), the |
|                                   | date of the last financial        |
|                                   | vulnerability indicator is the    |
|                                   | application date that Anne        |
|                                   | applied for the exemption, that   |
|                                   | is, the 1st of February 2015.     |

|                                   | -   Based on the information      |
|                                   |     provided during the test, the |

|                                   |     vulnerability which was the   |
|                                   |     12th of January 2014          |
|                                   | -   Mitchell makes a new          |

|                                   |     application and requests      |

|                                   |     the exemption due to the      |
|                                   |     results of the financial      |
