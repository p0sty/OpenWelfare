|                                   | -   Anne does not know how to set |
|                                   |     a budget and advises the      |
|                                   |     delegate that bills are often |
|                                   |     forgotten to be paid. Anne    |
|                                   |     also states that without      |

|                                   | -   Anne has also lost the        |
|                                   |     BasicsCard a number of times  |
|                                   |     and had to get a replacement  |
|                                   |     around the start of December  |

|                                   | -   Based on this information,    |
|                                   |     the delegate determines that  |
|                                   |     Anne is financially           |
|                                   |     vulnerable, and does not      |
|                                   |     grant Anne an exemption       |

|                                   | As there is no clear indicator of |
|                                   | financial vulnerability (FV), the |
|                                   | date of the last financial        |
|                                   | vulnerability indicator is the    |
|                                   | application date that Anne        |
|                                   | applied for the exemption, that   |
