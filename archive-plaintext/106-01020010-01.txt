When to offer an interpreter

A Service Officer should offer the use of an interpreter, when the
customer:

requests an interpreter

record identifies the need for an interpreter:

-   Centrelink: on the Other Contact Details (OCD) screen, in the
    Interpreter Language field
-   Child Support: in the Client Profile Window
-   Medicare: for programs that use CDMS, check the Personal Records for
    an Interpreter language Indicator in the Sensitive Information pop
    up table or tab, or under the Language Spoken At Home (other than
    English). For programs that do not use CDMS (or have view only
    access), the language will not be recorded
-   the customer's preferred spoken language has not been recorded, or
    the incorrect language is recorded, ask the customer for their
    preferred spoken language. See Contacting an on-demand telephone
    interpreter (Interpreter Connect)

has limited or no English proficiency. This may look like the:

-   customer nodding and agreeing to everything being said (this may
    show the customer does not understand what is being said, or it may
    be a cultural sign of respect)
-   Service Officer cannot understand what is being said

who normally understands English may need additional support, if:

-   they are in an emotional or stressful state
-   there are sensitive, complex or technical issues to be discussed

Customer declines the use of an interpreter

A customer may decline the use of an interpreter. If this occurs,
consider:

-   explaining to the customer it is the staff member who needs the
    interpreter, not the customer
-   talking with the customer's family members or friends to find out
    why the customer is declining an interpreter

If the customer continues to decline, record the details:

for Centrelink customers, on a DOC on the customer's record

for Medicare customers, under Personal Comments in the Medicare CDMS
system. CDMS notes only need to occur for members of the public where
staff have access to CDMS

for Child Support customers, in the Client Profile window:

-   select 'Language Other Than English Spoken At Home' check box
-   select the language
-   enable 'Interpreter required' menu and select 'No'
-   record the detail of refusal in a Notepad
