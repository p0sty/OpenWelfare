|                                   |     Kate’s care has decreased so  |
|                                   |     it will take effect in the    |
|                                   |     assessment from 3 March 2021. |
|                                   |     As Suzie’s level of care has  |
|                                   |     increased and it was notified |
|                                   |     more than 28 days after the   |
|                                   |     event. Suzie’s increased care |
|                                   |     will be applied in the        |
|                                   |     assessment from 19 April 2021 |
|                                   | -   family assistance assessment  |
|                                   |     from 3 March 2021 being the   |
|                                   |     date the change of care       |
|                                   |     occurred                      |

| 6                                 | Example 6                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mum and Dad equally share the     |
|                                   | care of 1 child (50% each). The   |
|                                   | child then moves into 100% care   |
|                                   | of an aunt, who is not a party to |
|                                   | the current assessment. This is a |
|                                   | terminating event for the current |
|                                   | child support assessment as both  |
|                                   | Mum and Dad cease to be eligible  |
|                                   | carers because their percentage   |
|                                   | of care has fallen to 0%.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a terminating event occurs,  |
|                                   | the assessment must change from   |
|                                   | the date of event even if the     |
|                                   | agency is notified after 28 days. |
|                                   | Mum and Dad would also lose their |
|                                   | entitlement to FTB for the child  |
|                                   | and the aunt will have the option |
|                                   | of making a claim.                |

|                                   | Fiona advised that their care for |
|                                   | Harry has increased from 50% to   |
|                                   | 70% from 17 March 2022. David     |
|                                   | disagreed, advising care had not  |
|                                   | changed and was still 50/50.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The disagreement about care       |
|                                   | arrangements was referred to      |
|                                   | Integrated Care who attempted     |
|                                   | contact with both customers to    |
|                                   | gather information and request    |
|                                   | evidence. Contact was             |
|                                   | unsuccessful. Letters were issued |
|                                   | to both customers asking for      |
|                                   | evidence to support their claims. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No evidence was received and      |
|                                   | neither customer called in        |
|                                   | response to the letters. A        |
|                                   | decision will be made to reject   |
|                                   | the change in care as evidence    |
|                                   | was not received to support the   |
|                                   | claim.                            |

|                                   | Fiona prior to making a care      |
|                                   | determination is required, to     |
|                                   | explain that a decision will be   |
|                                   | made to reject the care change.   |

|                                   | John advised that their care for  |

|                                   | disagreed, advising care had not  |
|                                   | changed and they still have 100%  |
|                                   | care of Megan.                    |
