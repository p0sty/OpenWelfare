This document explains how Single Touch Payroll (STP) data is used by
Services Australia. It explains how employment details and income
components are received, displayed and calculated.

 

What is Single Touch Payroll

Single Touch Payroll (STP) is an Australian Government initiative where
employers report payroll information via STP enabled software to the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) each time employees are paid. This STP
reported payroll information is known as a pay event. It can occur:

-   weekly
-   fortnightly
-   monthly
-   other frequencies

Reporting of pay events by employers using PayEvent 2020 data became
mandatory from 1 January 2022 but there has been an ongoing transition
period. This means customers may have all, some or none of their
employment details reported via STP. During this transition period,
customers may have all, some or none of their employment details
pre-filled. Reporting via STP will gradually increase over time.

Where available, STP data will pre-fill in customer and staff-facing
reporting tool. Services Australia accesses and prepares the required
data in near real time.

Customers are still responsible for checking their income details when
there is pre-filled STP data. Customers must review the pre-filled data
and make changes (adjust and/or add details), if needed. When the
customer is satisfied with the employment details, they must confirm the
data. The confirmed STP data then shows in the reporting task. The
customer can:

-   manually add any other employment details for themselves and their
    partner, and
-   add hours worked, if needed

The STP service simplifies the reporting of employment details, but does
not replace a customer's obligation to report all their circumstances
accurately.

Customers cannot opt out of pre-filling of STP data.

Single Touch Payroll data

Services Australia can access the STP data of customers who are a mutual
client of the ATO and Services Australia. The data can include, but not
limited to:

-   employer name and Australian Business Number (ABN)/Withholding Payer
    Number (WPN)
-   employment commencement date
-   employment status (full time, part time or casual)
-   salary and wages
-   allowances
-   bonuses and commission
-   voluntary superannuation deductions
-   salary sacrifice deductions
-   reportable fringe benefits
-   workers compensation
-   leave and redundancy payments
-   employment cessation details

STP data and Privacy

The safety of customers’ information is Services Australia's first
priority.

Services Australia will always tell customers what it is collecting, why
and who it will be shared with. The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act)
regulates how government agencies and some other organisations handle
personal information.

Services Australia will only get the information needed, and customers
can update their information if it’s incorrect.

Customers can find out more about privacy on the Services Australia
website.

STP Service Profiling

When an STP employer reports employment income data for an employee who
is on an income support payment (ISP), service profiling will place them
on 2 weekly statement reporting.

Service profiling can also take some customers off reporting. Customers
with no mutual obligation requirements and with no other employment
income, will be taken off reporting or reverted back to their prior
reporting requirements:

-   6 fortnights after confirming their STP cessation details including
    the cessation date, or
-   if there are no STP cessation details, after having no STP pay
    events for 6 consecutive fortnights

If customers are automatically taken off reporting for the above
reasons, or manually by a Service Officer and a later STP pay event is
available, the customer will be placed back on 2 weekly statement
reporting. See Process for more details.

STP Confirmation Service

When customers report through self service channels and STP data is
available, details will show in the STP confirmation service. This means
the reporting task will be a 2 step process.

The customer must review the pre-filled information, make any required
changes and then confirm the STP Declaration by selecting Submit and
continue. The customer will then enter the Report employment income
(REI) service to complete their reporting task. See Process for more
details.

If there is no STP data available at the time of reporting, the customer
will enter directly into the Report employment income (REI) service and
can add any employment income details, including partner income (if
applicable), and hours worked, if needed.

STP employers

When new STP employer data is available at the time a customer is
reporting the following will show:

-   employer’s name
-   ABN/WPN

The customer must review and either confirm or reject that they are
working for the STP employer.

Where the customer confirms they are working for the employer, the STP
details can be linked with an existing employer from their record or
have a new employer entry created. If the customer claims to not work
for the employer, the customer can reject it. See Process for more
details.

STP employment income

When a customer confirms an STP employer, STP pay events paid in the
customer’s entitlement period may pre-fill for the customer to check and
confirm or change.

There may be cases where the pre-filled STP data does not match the
gross amount that was paid in a customer’s reporting period. Pay event
data may include more than one type of income component. Customers can
check their payslip if they are unsure about the pre-filled STP details.
They can adjust the information if it is incorrect. See Processing STP
data

When STP data is confirmed and accepted by the customer, it is
automatically loaded onto the appropriate screens on the customer’s
record.

Early and holiday reporting

When a customer needs to report earlier than their usual reporting day
due to a public holiday or overseas departure, any available STP data
will pre-fill. If the employer has not yet run their payroll, the
customer must manually add employment income that they expect to be paid
in the full reporting period. This is no different to the process for
customers reporting early for non-STP employers.

If STP data becomes available to Services Australia after the relevant
reporting period is complete, it does not pre-fill in a later reporting
period for the customer to check.

Only STP pay events with a date paid in the relevant reporting period
will pre-fill for customers.

See Payment and reporting arrangements over national public holiday
periods. See Resources for an example.

Correcting confirmed STP data amounts

Customers are not able to make corrections to confirmed STP data through
self service channels.

If any of these confirmed amounts need to be updated, evidence must be
provided before corrections can be made by Service Officers.

Corrections to STP data must be made on EMGI using Update Past Periods
in the Earnings and Reporting workflow in Process Direct. Do not
manually make any updates directly on EAPP or IMPS. See Process for
details and Recording and correcting employment income details for
coding instructions.

Cessation data

When a current customer ceases work with an STP employer, cessation data
may pre-fill in the reporting task and include:

-   the date they stopped working
-   the reason they are no longer working
-   if any unused leave and/or a redundancy payment has been paid

Customers will be asked to give an explanation when:

-   they are subject to mutual obligation requirements during statement
    reporting or in a new claim
-   STP cessation data is pre-filled, and
-   the STP employer advises the cessation reason is dismissal or
    voluntary

An unemployment failure must be generated for PST-skilled Service
Officers to investigate.

When unused leave and redundancy payments are reported with cessation
data, the customer is asked to give the amount of days the leave covers
or their average weekly wage, to determine the duration of any potential
Income Maintenance Period (IMP). Service Officers must ensure that the
leave period is reasonable. See Table 4, Item 20.

STP employment status

STP employers include an employee’s employment status (for example, full
time, part time or casual) when reporting employment details to the ATO.
This data is available to Services Australia but is not mapped to the
record or used to make decisions about a customer’s ongoing
qualification for payment.

Customers may have Employed full-time - Yes pre-filled with the STP
employment details, for the first and second time it’s reported by their
employer. Customers can edit the full time employment status, if needed.
See Process for more details.

Pay Per Period (PayPP) amounts

Services Australia uses the STP data from pay events to calculate a Pay
Per Period (PayPP) amount. This is done by comparing the gross YTD (Year
to Date) figure of all income components from the previous Pay Event
with that of the current Pay Event. The difference between these amounts
is the PayPP amount, and shows as Gross STP Income.

When presented with pre-filled STP data, customers must review and
either confirm or change the PayPP details before the system applies the
amounts to the record. Assessable PayPP amounts that have been confirmed
are used to calculate a customer’s entitlement and are shown under Used
in PayPP Calculation.

For more details about the different types of income components, see
Assessment of employment income for Centrelink payments.

Income components that are assessable and included in the PayPP
calculation show to customers when they are reporting through their
Centrelink online account or the Express Plus mobile app. See Resources
to view which allowances are assessable.

Compensation payments reported via STP

Worker’s compensation payments paid by an STP employer, pre-fill as Paid
leave - worker’s compensation.

The system will check the Compensation Management Summary (CMS) screen
for a previous assessment by the Compensation Recovery Team (CRT). Where
this has already been assessed and is coded on CMS, the amounts reported
through STP will not be applied to the record.

Where there has not been a previous assessment of the worker’s
compensation, the pre-filled compensation amount will automatically load
onto the EAPP screen for at least 2 fortnights. The customer will need
to complete a MOD C - Compensation Details form. This can be completed
verbally during the customer contact, or via a paper form. Customers
reporting through their Centrelink online account or Express Plus
Centrelink mobile app will have an online task created to submit a MOD
C.

STP Interventions

STP interventions aim to prevent underpayments and overpayments for
customers with early education on correct reporting of employment
details.

Specialised staff manage intervention activities that are triggered when
customers make certain variations to their STP data.

There are 8 STP intervention activity types to address where a customer:

-   rejected an STP employer twice
-   varied first income for a STP employer
-   varied income down in two consecutive fortnights by more than $299
-   varied income down in two non-consecutive fortnights across 6 months
    by more than $299  
-   manually declared income however the Single Touch Payroll data
    varies by more than $299
-   is receiving JobSeeker Payment and rejected full-time ongoing status
    in two consecutive fortnights for a new employer
-   is receiving Disability Support Pension or Carer Payment and
    confirmed full-time ongoing status (carer customer is not receiving
    ex-wife pension (XWP))
-   is receiving Disability Support Pension or Carer Payment and
    rejected full-time ongoing status in two consecutive fortnights

Resources contains a link to the STP Programme intranet page and tables
detailing how certain Pay Per Period (PayPP) amounts are calculated for
various scenarios.
