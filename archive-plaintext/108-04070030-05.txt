|                                   | This is the test applied to       |
|                                   | ascertain whether customers are   |
|                                   | entitled to have more than 2      |
|                                   | hectares allowed as curtilage, a  |
|                                   | concession introduced on 1        |
|                                   | January 2007. The only property   |
|                                   | it can be applied to is the title |
|                                   | on which the home sits that       |

|                                   | size.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It may sometimes be evident that  |
|                                   | the test is or isn't being met.   |
|                                   | On other occasions, investigation |
|                                   | and assessment may be required    |
|                                   | with the resources of local staff |
|                                   | (knowledge of the area), Complex  |
|                                   | Assessment Officers (assess       |
|                                   | actual income), or a valuation to |
|                                   | (assess potential income).        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If there is income from the real  |
|                                   | estate, this is assessed under    |
|                                   | the Income Test.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the test is not being met, the |
|                                   | customer is assessed under the    |
|                                   | private land use test and may     |
|                                   | have access to 2 hectares of      |
|                                   | curtilage subject to it being     |
|                                   | used for domestic purposes only.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The aim of the extended land use  |
|                                   | test is to indicate whether the   |
|                                   | customer is making effective use  |
|                                   | of productive land to generate    |
|                                   | income, taking into consideration |
|                                   | their capacity. This still        |
|                                   | applies when the property is      |
|                                   | being sold and under contract if  |
|                                   | settlement is likely to be more   |
|                                   | than 3 months away. Unlike the    |
|                                   | private land use test, this means |
|                                   | there is no requirement that the  |
|                                   | land be used solely for private   |
|                                   | or domestic purposes and in fact  |
|                                   | the opposite is intended.         |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | protected under a law of the      |
|                                   | Commonwealth, State or Territory  |
|                                   | because of its natural, historic  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This exception requires a legal   |
|                                   | restriction being placed on a     |
|                                   | person that requires both blocks  |
|                                   | of land to be treated as a whole. |
|                                   | That is, the restriction means    |
|                                   | that the second block is not      |
|                                   | capable of being sold separately. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Example: A second block of land   |

|                                   | protected under law. If the       |
|                                   | protection means that the second  |
|                                   | block is unable to be sold        |
|                                   | separately then the second block  |
|                                   | could be treated as if it were    |
|                                   | held on the same title document.  |

|                                   | commercial purposes, it is        |
|                                   | assessable even if part of a      |
|                                   | property on 1 title of less than  |
|                                   | 2 hectares, and should be         |
|                                   | included and coded as part of the |
|                                   | customer's business assessment.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, if it is used partly for |
|                                   | domestic purposes then it is      |
|                                   | exempt.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Examples: A room set aside for a  |
|                                   | doctor's surgery is assessable,   |
|                                   | but a home office also used for   |
|                                   | non-work purposes is exempt.      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | precluding any other use is       |
|                                   | assessable, but grass where       |
|                                   | children play and on which farm   |
|                                   | animals graze, is exempt.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where a dual occupancy building   |
|                                   | was paid for by the customer or   |
|                                   | their partner and it is rented to |
|                                   | a person other than a near        |
|                                   | relative (or is available to      |
|                                   | rent), it is assessable. However, |
|                                   | if it was paid for by someone     |
|                                   | else (for example a relative who  |
|                                   | wanted to live nearby) or it is   |
|                                   | vacant and not available for rent |
|                                   | permanently (for example a        |
|                                   | holiday rental is not available   |
|                                   | over winter), or it is occupied   |
|                                   | by a near relative, then it is    |
|                                   | exempt. For example, a customer's |
|                                   | principal home is on a two-acre   |
|                                   | property and the customer paid    |
|                                   | for the construction of a small   |
|                                   | two bedroom cottage in the same   |
|                                   | title. If the cottage is rented   |
|                                   | to a distant relative, the        |
|                                   | cottage is an assessable asset    |
|                                   | and only the customer's principal |
|                                   | home and surrounding land is      |
|                                   | exempt                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a customer owns 2 units in the |
|                                   | same apartment block, it is not   |
|                                   | possible to exempt one under the  |
|                                   | dual occupancy rules.             |

|                                   | Don's house is on a 1 hectare     |
|                                   | title. Don also owns the adjacent |
|                                   | half hectare title and uses both  |
|                                   | for domestic purposes. Don is on  |
|                                   | payment immediately prior to 1    |
|                                   | January 2007 so both titles are   |
|                                   | included in the curtilage. From 1 |
|                                   | January 2007, this situation      |
|                                   | continues because the savings     |
|                                   | provision applies to Don and both |
|                                   | titles remain exempt from the     |
|                                   | assets test.                      |

|                                   | Don's payment is cancelled after  |
|                                   | 1 January 2007. If payment is not |
|                                   | restored, the savings provision   |
|                                   | is lost. If Don later reclaims,   |
|                                   | only the one hectare title on     |
|                                   | which the house sits is exempt    |
|                                   | and the second title is           |
|                                   | assessable under the assets test. |
