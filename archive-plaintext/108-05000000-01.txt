This document outlines different types of income, and how they are
assessed under social security law.

Identify income source

Examine the nature, source and purpose of the payment to identify if it
should be treated as income assessable for income test purposes.
Questions to ask include:

-   What is the purpose of the payment (is it for services rendered or
    earned)?
-   Is the amount received periodically or is it recurring?
-   Is the amount for the customer's own use or benefit?
-   Does the amount received relate to a specific time period?
-   What is the source of the payment (such as employer, own business or
    investments)?

Social security income test

Generally, the social security income test uses gross ordinary income.
However, income can be assessed in a variety of ways, depending on its
source, characteristics and purpose. For example:

-   Employment income uses the gross amount of income for assessment
-   Business income uses the net amount after allowable deductions
-   Investment income uses a deemed amount of income for assessment
    under the income test and ignores actual income amounts (unless the
    investment is exempt from deeming)

The Process page has a list of different types of income and how each is
treated.

Customers can add and update personal information (including income and
assets) online.

Ordinary and other ordinary income

The Social Security Act 1991 defines ordinary income as income that is
not an exempt lump sum or maintenance income. That is, income from all
sources except exempt lump sums or maintenance.

Other ordinary income is ordinary income that is not employment income.
It includes:

profit from self-employment

superannuation payments to the person

payment of compensation, or insurance, because the person cannot earn,
or get income, from work. For example, because of sickness or injury

payment to the person by a former employer because of termination of
employment

a comparable foreign payment
For more information on other ordinary income, see relevant:

-   Operational Blueprints in Contents and Related links below
-   Policy and Legislation in References

Note: other ordinary income plus employment income equals ordinary
income.

Income affects payments

Income affects payments in the following order:

-   Basic rate (plus any add-ons, including Youth Disability Supplement,
    other than those below)
-   Pension Supplement basic amount
-   Pension Supplement between basic and minimum amounts ('remaining
    portion')
-   Rent Assistance
-   Energy Supplement
-   Pension Supplement minimum amount
-   Pharmaceutical Allowance

Remote Area Allowance (RAA)

RAA is not reduced by income. Regardless of income received in a
fortnight, the customer receives the full entitlement of RAA if they:

-   are qualified to receive RAA, and
-   continue to qualify for basic rate

If the Pension Supplement minimum amount is payable, the full Energy
Supplement is automatically payable.

Unidentified or undisclosed income

Bank deposits (regular or irregular), may indicate a customer is
receiving assessable income. Investigate these deposits to determine the
source, nature or purpose of the funds.

Capital gains

A capital gain is generally not treated as income for social security
income support purposes. If a capital loss is made it cannot be offset
against other income amounts.

However, capital gains may be assessable (and capital losses included as
a business deduction) where they form part of the normal income and
expenses of a business. Capital gains will also be assessed as income
where they are distributed to a non-controller of a private trust or
company.

For family assistance, capital gains are included in a family's adjusted
taxable income as assessed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Estimates of taxable income should include any expected capital gains.

Income exempt or excluded from assessment

Some income amounts are excluded from assessment under legislation (for
example, emergency relief) or by policy, based on the characteristics of
the amount (monies received to cover expenses), while other amounts
receive approval for exemption upon application and approval by the
delegate under section 8 (11) - Exempt Lump Sums.

Children born or entering care:

-   on or after 1 October 2016, Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and
    Partner Pay (DAP) is counted as ordinary income for income support
    purposes
-   before 1 October 2016, PPL and DAP is not counted as income for
    income support purposes

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them the chance to provide more information or evidence
-   tell them of their review and appeal rights. If needed, record their
    application for a formal review of the decision

Make 2 genuine attempts to contact the customer before finalising the
decision.
