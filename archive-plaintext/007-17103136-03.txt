|                                   |     and so it is not possible for |
|                                   |     a customer to ask for a       |
|                                   |     review of a decision about    |
|                                   |     their entitlement. The claim  |
|                                   |     is taken not to have been     |
|                                   |     made. The customer can ask    |
|                                   |     for a review of the decision  |
|                                   |     which made the claim not      |
|                                   |     effective. If the claim is    |
|                                   |     still found to be not         |
|                                   |     effective, a new claim will   |
|                                   |     need to be lodged. A new      |
|                                   |     claim is made not effective   |
|                                   |     if requested documents were   |
|                                   |     lodged late and this decision |
