The lodgement of the Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) is used as proof
of birth for the newborn child and is not a claim for PPL. If the
customer is not already FTB current, the online claim for PPL or Claim
for Paid Parental Leave and Family Tax Benefit (FA100) is still required
within the requested timeframe for the claim to be effective.
