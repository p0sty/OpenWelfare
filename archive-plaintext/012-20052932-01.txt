This document outlines how to process allied health professionals
Healthcare Provider Identifier – Individual (HPI-I) applications
received through the online channel.

Online applications

Allied health professionals can apply for their HPI-I online through
Health Professionals Online Services (HPOS).

The application can be used to:

-   register
-   add health professions, and
-   upload evidence of ongoing membership with their professional
    association

Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) registrants can
also use the form to add an allied health profession to their existing
HPI-I record.

Processing

The data is entered into the eHealth Provider (EHP) system by the
applicant. There is no data entry needed by staff.

The applications drop into EHP for staff intervention to make sure:

-   the applicant isn’t already registered in the Healthcare Identifiers
    (HI) Service
-   the evidence of membership with a professional association is
    correct
-   professional associations and professions that are new are sent to
    Provider HI Service and My Health Record Subject Matter Expert (SME)
    for checking
-   other minor discrepancies, such as incorrect dates, are fixed

Applications are available through the Workload Management (WLM) system,
or directly through eHealth Provider (EHP) system.
