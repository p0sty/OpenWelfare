This document outlines the process of raising AoS debts and the role of
the National AoS Team and service centres in this process. This includes
where liability lies for repayment of the AoS debt.

AoS

An AoS is a legally binding agreement signed by an individual or
organisation to financially support someone who is applying to migrate
to Australia on a specific type of visa.

Recoverable payments

If an assuree receives a recoverable social security payment during the
AoS period:

-   the assurer is liable to repay the amount of payment received, and
-   an AoS debt will be raised against the assurer

If it is a joint AoS, all the assurers are equally liable. The AoS debt
begins to accumulate from the date the assuree is granted a recoverable
income support payment.

Recoverable social security payments are outlined in the Social Security
Guide under section 9.4.1.10 Overview of the AoS scheme. See the
Reference page.

The AoS debt is raised as ‘Determined’ debt every 12 months or once the
AoS period has expired.

Bank guarantee

Where an AoS is a mandatory requirement for entry into Australia, a bank
guarantee must be provided before the AoS arrangement can be accepted.
This bank guarantee will be cancelled at the end of the AoS period
unless a recoverable AoS debt has been incurred. See AoS bank guarantee
and term deposit.

Where an AoS debt has been incurred, Services Australia will draw on the
bank guarantee every 12 months to repay the AoS debt. This will cease
once the bank guarantee is depleted, or the AoS debt stops accruing.

If the AoS debt is less than the bank guarantee, the remaining funds
will be refunded to the assurer who lodged the bank guarantee at the end
of the AoS period.

If the debt exceeds the bank guarantee amount, normal recovery will take
place following recovery of the bank guarantee every 12 months until the
AoS period expires.

See Recovery of Assurance of Support (AoS) debts.

AoS debts

Before the migration to Process Direct in September 2018, AoS debts were
raised in the Debt Management and Information (DMIS) system of Customer
Record.

AoS debts are now raised in Process Direct via AoS Yearly and Expiry
Review work items. They have a status of ‘For Manual Action’. If an
assuree receives an AoS recoverable payment during their AoS period,
Process Direct generates the following reviews as needed:

-   AoS Quarterly Reviews
-   Yearly Reviews, and
-   Expiry Reviews

To complete the review, AoS Processing staff need:

-   ZC.C4.PD.AOS.PROCESSING.STAFF (AOS3) access role, and
-   NV_CLK_RVW AoS skill tag

Request access via ESSentials.

An AoS debt is only raised when:

-   there is a current AoS arrangement in force
-   the assuree is not receiving sufficient support from their assurer,
    and
-   the assuree is in receipt of an AoS recoverable payment

Services Australia will automatically raise all AoS debts for recovery
12 months from the date the assuree is first granted a payment, and
continue either until the:

-   end of the AoS period (after 1, 2, 4 or 10 years), or
-   assuree no longer receives a recoverable income support payment

An AoS debt will first be recovered from any lodged bank guarantee. If
the bank guarantee has been depleted, the assurer will need to repay any
outstanding debts.

Multiple AoS debts may be raised on assurer(s) record when there are 2
assurees and both claim a recoverable payment. Debts will first be
recovered from the:

-   AoS bond (debt reason ASB), or
-   assurer (debt reason ASN) when there is no bond to recover

ASB and ASN debts are raised with separate debt IDs. If the assuree
received different payment types, each payment types are raised with
separate debt IDs.

AoS debt reasons

-   ASB - Assurance of Support Bond Recovery (Auto) - Debt to be
    recovered from the bond
-   ASN - Assurance of Support debt - automatic (Assurer) Auto - Debt to
    be recovered from the assurer
-   ASO - Assurance of Support Recovery - old (Assurer) Manual - Debt to
    be recovered from the assurer

Joint assurers

Joint assurers are jointly and equally liable to repay the entire AoS
debt amount. For example, there are 2 assurers. The AoS debt amount is
$10,000. Both assurers are liable for the entire amount, however they
can decide the amount each assurer will repay in order to finalise the
debt.

Joint assurers debts are raised as multiple liability debt with the same
debt IDs.

Manual debt

The quarterly, yearly, expiry and bond return reviews are not
automatically generated when the assuree has been granted a recoverable
payment on a multiple record instead of the assuree’s AoS record.

Service officers need to raise a manual debt directly on the assurer's
record in the Debt Management and Information System (DMIS) and issue
manual debt letters.

When the AoS yearly or expiry reviews are generated in Process Direct
and contains incorrect debt details, as a last resort AoS processing
staff may need to:

-   zero out the debt to finalise the review
-   raise manual debts, and
-   issue manual letters

See Table 2 for manual debts.

AoS Yearly Review

Once an assuree has received a recoverable payment for 12 months, a
yearly review manual work item is created. This enables AoS processing
staff to create an AoS debt in Debt Management and Information System
(DMIS) for the assurer(s) to repay.

This review ensures an AoS determined debt is raised for all assurer(s)
in the AoS case.

AoS debts are raised on the assuree’s record every 12 months via an AoS
Yearly Review in Process Direct. AoS processing staff will process the
AoS Yearly Review (For Manual Action status). Once the Yearly Review is
processed a:

-   debt is raised on the assurer’s record
-   Statement of Account letter (Debt Statement) is issued
-   full or partial Bank Guarantee Release letter with a bond amount is
    issued to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) to recover full
    or partial AoS debts to repay Services Australia, if applicable

AoS Expiry Review

An expiry review manual work item is only created for an AoS skilled
service officer to action if:

-   the AoS case has expired, and
-   an assuree(s) has received a recoverable payment prior to expiry

This review ensures an AoS determined debt is raised for all assurer(s)
in the AoS case. The expiry review will generate an AoS debt for the
assurer(s) to repay.

If there is no recoverable payment amounts, the expiry review will auto
complete and no user interact is needed.

unfavourable decision.
