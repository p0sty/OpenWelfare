|                                   | The customer is asked how many    |
|                                   | days the leave payment covers, or |
|                                   | their average weekly wage. The    |
|                                   | customer advises the leave was    |
|                                   | for 13 days and ‘accepts’ the     |
|                                   | income. An IMP is then imposed    |
|                                   | for 2 weeks and 3 days (13 work   |
|                                   | days) from 2 June until 20 June.  |

|                                   | On 2 March 2022, the STP employer |
|                                   | incorrectly reports $600 gross    |
|                                   | for this pay event, however, the  |
|                                   | customer was paid their usual     |
|                                   | wage of $500 gross. The Service   |
|                                   | Officer advises the customer that |
|                                   | they must declare the gross       |
|                                   | income they were paid in their    |
|                                   | reporting period and explains how |
|                                   | the customer can do this when     |
|                                   | reporting through the app         |

|                                   | The customer goes back to their   |
|                                   | app and edits the pre-filled      |
|                                   | amount of $600 to $500, to match  |
|                                   | their payslip and completes their |
|                                   | report.                           |

|                                   | When the employer realises their  |
|                                   | mistake and makes the correction  |
|                                   | to the reported STP data, it will |
|                                   | have no impact to the customer’s  |

|                                   | per fortnight. The customer has a |
|                                   | salary packaging arrangement,     |
|                                   | where $100 is deducted per        |
|                                   | fortnight, which goes to          |
|                                   | superannuation. This arrangement  |
|                                   | means the customer pays less tax. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When the customer views their     |
|                                   | pre-filled STP data, they see     |
|                                   | salary and wages of $794.80 and   |
|                                   | salary sacrifice of $100. They    |
|                                   | initially thought the details     |
|                                   | were incorrect, as the customer   |
|                                   | felt their ‘taxable’ income to be |
|                                   | assessed should be $694.80 per    |
|                                   | fortnight. They contact           |
|                                   | Centrelink to discuss the         |

|                                   | sacrificed amount is for          |
|                                   | visibility only, and doesn’t      |
|                                   | reduce their gross assessable     |
|                                   | income. The customer confirms the |
|                                   | pre-filled income that needs to   |
|                                   | be declared and reported as       |
|                                   | $794.80.                          |

|                                   | discounted accommodation. As this |
|                                   | is for a car, the customer        |
|                                   | answers no. If it did include     |
|                                   | free or discounted accommodation, |
|                                   | the customer would be asked the   |
|                                   | amount, which would then reduce   |
|                                   | the amount of fringe benefits to  |

|                                   | reinstatement does not change the |

|                                   | reporting will, as a result, show |
