|                                   | different person as a nominee, or |

|                                   | Answer: Yes. If the customer has  |
|                                   | capacity, they can appoint a      |
|                                   | nominee different to their        |

|                                   | document. As with any voluntary   |

|                                   | can change this at any time. An   |
