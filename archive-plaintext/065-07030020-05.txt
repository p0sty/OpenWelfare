|                                   | Scenario: Nick has been a         |
|                                   | registered member of the PBS      |
|                                   | since 1 July 2005. Nick works a   |
|                                   | 20 hour week. On 1 January 2007,  |
|                                   | after accruing 1 ½ bonus years    |
|                                   | Nick becomes ill and is absent    |
|                                   | from work for 12 weeks.           |

|                                   | March 2007 is a non-accruing      |
|                                   | period. The effect of the         |
|                                   | non-accruing period is to         |
|                                   | lengthen Nick's bonus period by   |
|                                   | 12 weeks. Instead of the bonus    |
|                                   | period finishing on 30 June 2007  |
|                                   | it will finish on 22 September    |
|                                   | 2007, giving Nick an additional   |
|                                   | 12 weeks to meet the work test    |
|                                   | requirement of 960 hours per      |
|                                   | bonus year.                       |

|                                   | example Nick had already worked   |
|                                   | 960 hours before becoming ill,    |
|                                   | the non-accruing period would not |
|                                   | need to be applied.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If Nick was absent from work and  |
|                                   | in receipt of compensation or     |
|                                   | Carer Payment (CP) for the 12     |
|                                   | week period the effect of the     |
|                                   | non-accruing period would be the  |
|                                   | same. The bonus period would be   |
|                                   | extended by 12 weeks, allowing    |
|                                   | additional time to meet the work  |
|                                   | test. However, in the case of     |
|                                   | compensation or receipt of CP, no |
|                                   | discretion is allowed. A          |
|                                   | non-accruing period must be       |
|                                   | applied.                          |
