This document outlines how staff and Team Leaders/Analysts view and
manage work items Unfinalised activity - Immediate action required
(unfinalised activities).

Unfinalised activity work items

Unfinalised activities are work items:

-   generated by a staff member, and
-   left open for more than one day in a customer’s record for an
    unknown reason

They only relate to work generated and are actioned by staff in Customer
First or Customer Record.

Examples include:

-   A DOC left open on a customer’s record. This does not include a Fast
    Note left open as a handoff in line with an approved process
-   Started updates left open more than one day, such as earnings,
    income and assets, or other. This does not include items left open
    in line with an approved process
-   A hand off created using the ACTDOC/CALLDOC guided procedure. Staff
    must not use this guided procedure
-   An advice letter triggered for manual action after a staff member
    has finalised an associated activity
-   A staff initiated reassessment activity that may be a benefit
    refresh or ripple activity
-   Generic debt work created by staff outside of an endorsed process
-   A staff initiated workflow commenced in Customer First and not
    completed

Staff notification

Staff are notified of an unfinalised activity that needs action by
receiving:

-   an Unfinalised activity - Immediate action required (ZIAM_UNFACTN)
    work item in their Customer First/Work Optimiser Inbox, and
-   a NOREPLY notification email from Workload Management (WLM) telling
    them a work item is assigned to their Inbox for action

Once notified, staff must finalise these work items immediately. See
Work Optimiser for staff. This will ensure the correct process is used,
and actionable work is not left open on the customer’s record
unnecessarily. Work items will stay in the staff member’s Inbox until
they are finalised.

The Work Optimiser 'Enable Email Notifications' function will remain
turned on. Staff can turn off 'Enable Email Notifications' at any time
through Work Optimiser > Staff Profile. For details about how to change
Work Optimiser email notifications, see Work Optimiser for staff.

The Resources page contains contact details for the Enterprise Payment
and Service Maintenance (EPSM) Team.
