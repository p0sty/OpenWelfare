This document outlines how Quality Management Officers (QMOs) complete
quality checks in emergency claims using the Quality Management
Application (QMA).

Quality Checking

Emergency claims are selected for quality checking using QMA. These
include:

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   New Zealand Disaster Recovery Payment (NZ DRP)
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA)
-   New Zealand Disaster Recovery Allowance (NZ DRA)

QMOs are allocated these work items for quality checking via Workload
Management (WLM). They receive allocations aligned to their:

-   skillset (the type of work they are skilled to do), and
-   business and technical knowledge in the work type

QMA Checking Interface

Emergency claims are quality checked using Integrated QMA. When
completing a check, this means that QMOs will:

-   have the QMA Processing button greyed-out under the More Options
    button
-   complete the quality check by clicking Next moving through screens
    and/or the workflow with provisional data that has been updated by
    staff, using the Task Selector

Disaster Recovery Workflow

Emergency claims use a question-based workflow to capture the online
claim responses. These screens will display FORM on the SuperKey. The
following are not available in the question-based workflow:

-   QMA Action column
-   No-Error and Error

Record errors identified on the QMA Summary. QMOs must take additional
steps to:

-   quality check the workflow
-   record outcomes, and
-   undertake corrective action, where required

QMOs must take extra care when quality checking this component to ensure
the correct outcomes are applied.
