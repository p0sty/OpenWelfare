This document outlines the TFES and how to claim TFES assistance.

Assistance for shippers

TFES was introduced on 1 July 1976 to address the sea freight cost
disadvantage experienced by Tasmanian industries. The Scheme assists
shippers who transport eligible goods by sea between Tasmania and the
Australian mainland. Shippers can make claims for TFES assistance
directly to Services Australia, after paying the freight costs.

Delivering government services

Services Australia administers TFES on behalf of the Department of
Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the
Arts. The Scheme operates under a set of Ministerial Directions approved
by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts.

Receipt of TFES form in a Service Centre

Service Officers in Service Centres who receives TFES forms must date,
scan the forms and email to the Tasmanian Transport Programs team on the
day they are received. Do not scan to the customer record.

team, Services Australia website and the Department of Infrastructure,
