|                                   | Tertiary study is divided into 5  |
|                                   | levels. The levels are treated    |
|                                   | separately and study in 1 level   |
|                                   | does not affect allowable time    |
|                                   | for study at another level.       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | As a general rule, most study has |
|                                   | a 'use-by-date'. After a period   |
|                                   | of time, the student will have    |
|                                   | forgotten much of what was taught |
|                                   | and in many fields the course     |
|                                   | content will also have become     |
|                                   | outdated. Most education          |
|                                   | providers will not count study    |
|                                   | completed more than 10 years ago  |
|                                   | towards the program requirements. |
|                                   | It would be unfair of Services    |
|                                   | Australia to count study that is  |
|                                   | no longer useful to the student,  |
|                                   | as this would prevent them from   |
|                                   | updating their qualifications.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: study undertaken more than  |
|                                   | 10 years ago is counted for       |
|                                   | Austudy and Pensioner Education   |
|                                   | Supplement (PES) if it was part   |
|                                   | of a program that was completed   |
|                                   | within the last 10 years. This is |
|                                   | because the student would have a  |
|                                   | qualification that is 10 years or |
|                                   | less old. 10 years is counted     |
|                                   | from the first day of the         |
|                                   | customer's current course, not    |
|                                   | their current year of study. The  |
|                                   | 10 years is counted from the day  |
|                                   | the student enrols in their       |
|                                   | current course, not their current |
|                                   | year of study. Once an allowable  |
|                                   | time assessment has been          |
|                                   | completed, it is not reassessed   |
|                                   | at a later date to allow previous |
|                                   | study to 'drop off' and produce a |
|                                   | different outcome regarding       |
|                                   | payability. ABSTUDY disregards    |
|                                   | studies undertaken more than 10   |
|                                   | years ago.                        |

|                                   | completion of another program.    |

|                                   | completed program Y.              |

|                                   | If a student cannot do X without  |
|                                   | having done Y it would be         |
|                                   | illogical to deny payment for the |
|                                   | later program because the student |
|                                   | has done the earlier one. It is   |
|                                   | possible that a course has a      |
|                                   | prerequisite of part of a course  |
|                                   | rather than a completed course.   |
|                                   | The Bachelor of Social Work has   |
|                                   | traditionally had a prerequisite  |
|                                   | of 2 years of undergraduate       |
|                                   | study. This incomplete            |
|                                   | prerequisite study should be      |
|                                   | disregarded under this provision. |
