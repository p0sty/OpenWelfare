Update an employee's pay cycle

Note: if updating a pay cycle for an employee that has Employer
Withholding with Arrears (EWA) in place, the payment arrangement will
need to be ended before updating the pay cycle, and re-keyed when the
employee is on the correct pay cycle. See Employer withholding (linking)
Cuba Process Help.
