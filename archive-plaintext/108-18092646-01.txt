The document is the main guide and starting point for coding
accommodation updates including Rent Assistance (RA).

RA profile reviews and Accommodation Circumstance Interventions

This procedure does not apply to customers responding to a Rent
Assistance (RA) profile review or Accommodation Circumstance
Intervention (ACI).

Income Management

Complete a priority needs assessment when an income managed customer
notifies a change that affects rent details. This includes a change of
address or a change to their living arrangements.

Accommodation changes

Update accommodation details when a customer tells the agency about a
change in:

-   their address
-   the amount of rent they pay, or
-   their living arrangements (for example, people moving in or out of
    the household)

Accommodation Details (AC) screen

The AC screen includes details of:

the address type (for example, the accommodation details are for a
temporary address)

the relevant date for the accommodation details

whether the accommodation details are for the:

-   customer only, or
-   customer and their partner

the type of ownership the customer has over the accommodation

the type of rent paid, if any

whether the customer is sharing the accommodation

rent payment information, this includes:

-   total rent paid for the property
-   the amount paid by the customer (or the customer and their partner),
    and
-   the frequency of rent payments

whether evidence of the rent paid is needed and/or has been received
along with the type of verification

if the accommodation is for a sub-tenant where the primary tenant pays
subsidised rent for public housing

the reason and date the customer vacated their principal home, if
relevant

a savings provision relating to RA, if relevant

Information recorded on the AC screen determines:

-   the asset test if the customer is receiving an asset tested payment
-   if RA is payable and at what rate

Quality On Line (QOL) tool step question options for the AC screen

Incorrect coding of Home ownership status or Net Rent details is a
critical error. The activity will be returned for correction.

Incorrect coding of the following AC screen fields will result in a
critical error when the coding impacts payment correctness:

-   Accommodation details field
-   Sharer Status field
-   Type of rent field
-   Rent verification field

For more details search QOL tool in the A-Z of Rent Assistance terms and
codes.

The Resources page contains information about reading the Assessment
Results (AR) screen following an RA update, understanding the date of
effect, determining the date of event when RA is included in a new
claim.
