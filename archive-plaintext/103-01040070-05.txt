| 1                                 | Sarah's regular expenses          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the Initial Assessment         |
|                                   | interview, Sarah was issued a     |
|                                   | BasicsCard which will be used to  |
|                                   | buy food each fortnight. Sarah    |
|                                   | also set up the following regular |
|                                   | expenses:                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Schools Meals Program $50.00  |
|                                   | -   Medical Expenses $10.00       |
|                                   | -   Rent $260                     |
|                                   | -   Utilities $30                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah usually has $65 credited to |
|                                   | the Income Management account     |
|                                   | each fortnight from their         |
|                                   | Parenting Payment Single (PPS)    |
|                                   | and Family Tax Benefit (FTB).     |
|                                   | Sarah has enough to cover all     |
|                                   | regular expenses incurred.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Sarah's BasicsCard allocation  |
|                                   | is by the Residual Payment        |
|                                   | method, $115 will automatically   |
|                                   | transfer to the BasicsCard after  |
|                                   | the expenses have been paid.      |

|                                   | Sarah starts casual work and      |
|                                   | their PPS payment is reduced so   |
|                                   | only $330 goes into the Income    |
|                                   | Management account this           |
|                                   | fortnight. The system will pay    |
|                                   | Sarah's expenses using the        |
|                                   | payment priority order.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the system does not make    |
|                                   | part payments and once it cannot  |
|                                   | pay an expense in full it stops   |
|                                   | going down the list.              |

|                                   | The following expenses will be    |
|                                   | paid for Sarah                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 1. Schools Meals Program of $50   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 2. Medical Expenses of $10        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | 3. Rent of $260                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This would leave $10 in Sarah's   |
|                                   | Income Management account. As     |
|                                   | there are insufficient funds      |
|                                   | available, the utilities of $30   |
|                                   | would not be paid. No funds would |
|                                   | be transferred to the BasicsCard, |
|                                   | as all regular expenses were not  |
|                                   | paid. If Sarah still wanted a     |
|                                   | payment to be made to the         |
|                                   | utilities company, Sarah would    |
|                                   | need to make arrangements to pay  |
|                                   | it from their discretionary       |
|                                   | funds.                            |
