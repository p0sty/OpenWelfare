The ABSTUDY Standard Hostels Agreement

The ABSTUDY Standard Hostels Agreement determines the conditions for
payment of ABSTUDY away from home rate of Living Allowance, Rent
Assistance and Remote Area Allowance for students residing in the
hostel.

The Agreement also determines the period of entitlement for away from
home rate payable to the hostel for a student who ceases study prior to
the end of a school term.

Payments made to hostels

ABSTUDY secondary school boarding students residing in hostel
accommodation, must have ABSTUDY payments directed to the hostel.

Hostels that are signatories to the ABSTUDY Standard Hostels Agreement,
are paid ABSTUDY boarding instalment lump sums for eligible ABSTUDY
secondary boarders. Payment of away from home rate will be made
fortnight-in-arrears to a hostel who is not a signatory to the ABSTUDY
Standard Hostels Agreement.

An ABSTUDY Standard Hostels Agreement is valid for up to a 3 year
period. The hostel must renew the Agreement each period to continue to
qualify for ABSTUDY boarding instalment payments.

The Resources page contains a list of all current hostel signatories to
the Agreement and its expiry date (including the Aboriginal Hostel
Limited (AHL) hostels that are subject to the national Agreement),
contact details for AHL and a link to the ABSTUDY Standard Hostels
Agreement.
