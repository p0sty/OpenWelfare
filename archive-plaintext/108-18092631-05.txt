|                                   | The changed address has no impact |
|                                   | on the customer's eligibility for |

|                                   | information is different from     |
|                                   | accompanying formal rental        |
|                                   | agreement                         |

|                                   | Ted provides a SU523HD and a      |
|                                   | formal rental agreement. The      |
|                                   | SU523HD lists the rent amount as  |
|                                   | $220 per week. This is the amount |
|                                   | Ted advised over the phone when   |
|                                   | the change of address was first   |
|                                   | notified. There are no changes to |
|                                   | the SU523HD, however the formal   |
|                                   | rental agreement has the rent     |
|                                   | amount as $250 per week.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Both amounts would result in the  |
|                                   | maximum rate of RA.               |

|                                   | As the formal rental agreement is |
|                                   | a legal document, the amount of   |
|                                   | $250 per week is accepted and     |
|                                   | updated as verified VEF -         |
