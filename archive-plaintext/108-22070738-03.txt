|                                   | reports, there may be times when  |

|                                   | pre-filled. The most common       |
|                                   | scenarios are where customers are |
|                                   | paid weekly, or fortnightly       |
|                                   | payroll which is reported by the  |
|                                   | employer to the ATO on the same   |

|                                   | Customers who are paid weekly by  |
|                                   | their STP employer, may have only |
|                                   | one pay event pre-filled at the   |
|                                   | time of their report. Even if an  |
|                                   | employer has reported their       |
|                                   | payroll data on the same day, the |
|                                   | STP data needs time to be         |
|                                   | prepared for it to pre-fill.      |

|                                   | The customer must add pay details |
|                                   | that haven’t pre-filled. In some  |
|                                   | cases, it may be appropriate to   |
|                                   | discuss with the customer about   |
