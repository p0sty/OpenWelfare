Single Touch Payroll (STP) Assessment of allowances paid with employment income

This information is for STP purposes only

If STP data shows that a customer has had an allowance paid, they will
be asked to check, confirm or change the pre-filled details. The
allowance type will indicate if the amount needs to be included as
assessable income for the reporting period.

Allowance data available through STP will have an indicator to show the
assessable components across all reporting channels. This will help
customers understand the income used in their fortnightly reporting
process.
