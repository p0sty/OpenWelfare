|                                   | requirements. In particular,      |
|                                   | components of labour market       |
|                                   | programs may be assessed under    |

|                                   | requirement. For example, the New |

|                                   | customer undertaking this         |
|                                   | activity may have it assessed as  |
|                                   | training (for that component of   |
|                                   | the course), followed by an       |
|                                   | assessment for work (setting up a |
|                                   | business). In this case, once the |
|                                   | training component was completed, |
|                                   | or the time limit exhausted, the  |
|                                   | customer would need to apply for  |

|                                   | for the work component.           |

|                                   | may meet the Study levels for     |

|                                   | activity instead of a work or     |
|                                   | training requirement. As study    |
|                                   | has a higher time limit than work |
|                                   | or training activities, the study |
|                                   | limit is applied as it is the     |
|                                   | most beneficial.                  |

|                                   | will decide which type of         |

|                                   | which time limit will apply to    |
