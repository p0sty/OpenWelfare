Create an ancillary provider organisation registration

Table 3: this table explains all ancillary provider applicants,
including individuals, must have an organisation registration created.
If a pharmacist makes an application and reports immunisation
information to the AIR, the application is not processed. Call the
applicant to advise them of this. They use a pharmacy (ancillary)
provider number.

The Resources page has a link to the Connecting Pharmacies to the AIR
infographic, to help pharmacies.
