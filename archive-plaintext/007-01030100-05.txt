P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios.

-   If a step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has been
    transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   If the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and
    they later separate. Care details for the child will not be
    transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh
    is requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, if FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on the
Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and the
customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation.

The workaround for P24845 must be re-applied to affected records every
time care is reassessed (if the workaround has previously been applied).

See Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family
Tax Benefit (FTB) for further information, including details of the
workaround and recording of Display on Access (DOA) DOCs.
