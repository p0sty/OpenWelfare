This document outlines procedures for Service Officers to follow when a
Medicare Claim form (MS014) is submitted incomplete or incorrect. Note:

Medicare claims made in person at a Service Centre.

Incomplete or incorrect details supplied on Medicare claim forms

Where a Medicare Claim form (MS014) is submitted and it is incomplete or
incorrect details have been supplied, Service Officers must adhere to
the policy and procedures detailed in this document.

A claim form is considered incomplete if:

-   claimant or patient cannot be uniquely identified and the Medicare
    number is missing or incorrect on the claim form
-   claimant details not provided
-   claimant signature is missing

A claim form is considered incorrect if:

-   patient is not enrolled on the Medicare number quoted
-   claimant signature provided is in wrong section

The Process page contains steps to follow when a Medicare form is
incomplete or incorrect

Contacting claimant to obtain necessary information

Where a Medicare claim form (MS014) is submitted and is either
incomplete or incorrect details have been supplied the Service Officer
needs to contact the claimant to process the claim. Service Officers
must attempt to contact the claimant at least once to obtain the
necessary information in order to process the claim.

The Process page provides situations where a claimant must be contacted
for incomplete or incorrect forms submitted.

If the claimant is unable to be contacted by phone, or the required
information is unable to be obtained, the claim must be sent back to the
claimant accompanied by the appropriate standard letter. Claimant
details such as their postal address, phone number, EFT details and
organ donor registration must be recorded before sending the claim back
to the claimant. Note: Service Officers must not update any details if
the claimant has not signed the Medicare claim form.

Service Officers must keep a copy of the MS014 form, account and
Standard Letter for their batch work where they have updated any
information in Consumer Directory Maintenance System (CDMS) including
adding a comment in the personal section under the claimant in CDMS that
they are returning the paperwork to the claimant.

The Resources page contains a link to the Standard Letter Templates
page.

Note: if at any time Service Officers are in doubt about the validity of
a claim being processed, they should escalate the matter to their
supervisor.
