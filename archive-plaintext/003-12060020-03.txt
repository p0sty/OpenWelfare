This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

|                                   | disability is claiming to care    |

|                                   | intellectual disability while the |
|                                   | adult child is claiming to care   |
|                                   | for their partner with a mental   |
|                                   | illness. In these situations it   |
|                                   | can be difficult for the service  |

|                                   | Carer referrals often relate to   |
|                                   | either a new claim or a customer  |
|                                   | already receiving a payment. It   |
|                                   | is important that the social      |
|                                   | worker make sufficient effort to  |
|                                   | gather the information needed to  |
|                                   | prevent overpayments or incorrect |
|                                   | decisions being made.             |

|                                   | the social worker is to send a    |

|                                   | another customer. This is         |
|                                   | particularly important if the     |
|                                   | care receiver has disclosed       |
|                                   | family violence or carer neglect  |

|                                   | record. In this instance, the     |
|                                   | social worker should create a DOC |
|                                   | on the carer’s record that refers |

|                                   | Most Carer Assessments will need  |
|                                   | a report to be written due to the |
|                                   | complexity of the care situation  |
|                                   | and the amount of information     |
|                                   | gathered from multiple parties.   |
|                                   | If the assessment is not complex  |
|                                   | or sensitive, the social worker   |
|                                   | can record the information on a   |
|                                   | DOC on the document list.         |
