This document outlines the processes for implementing the outcome of a
review of decision or appeal made under either the Targeted Compliance
Framework or the Job Seeker Compliance Framework.

Responsibility for implementing review outcomes

When a formal review of a job seeker compliance decision made under
social security law has been completed, this is returned to the:

-   Appeals Support Team if a priority review, or
-   Participation Solutions Team (PST) who conducted the quality check
    for implementation if not a priority review

The Review Decision workflow in the Participation Compliance workflow is
used to implement the decision. PST-skilled Service Officers with a
WNPPD security resource or Appeals Support Team Service Support Officers
with WNPPD security resource have access to this workflow for
implementing review outcomes.

When the outcome of a review is discussed with a customer and they
indicate their intention to lodge an appeal with the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal (AAT), the customer should be encouraged to make their
appeal directly to the AAT in person, by phone, via an application form
or online. If an AAT request for review form is lodged with Services
Australia, forward to the AAT immediately.

Implementing outcomes of Targeted Compliance Framework decisions

Targeted Compliance Framework decisions that Services Australia have
responsibility for implementing a review of decision include:

-   suspension decisions as a result of a mutual obligation failure or
    work refusal failure
-   application of a financial penalty as a result of a mutual
    obligation failure, including the amount of the financial penalty
-   cancellation of payment as a result of a mutual obligation failure,
    work refusal failure, unemployment failure or failure to re-engage
    with reconnection requirement within 29 days
-   application of an unemployment preclusion period or post
    cancellation non-payment period, including the start date and
    duration of this period

The outcome of the formal review of these decisions should be
implemented within 7 days of the review decision date.

Note: an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) decision must only be
implemented when directed by the FOI and Litigation Branch. The decision
must be implemented within 7 days, unless the job seeker faces immediate
implementation of an adverse decision without the opportunity to
consider further appeal options.

When a decision to apply a first or second mutual obligation failure is
set aside, the job seeker's financial penalty for any subsequent mutual
obligation failures in the same failure group will be adjusted
automatically by the system.

The 13 week favourable determination rules apply. When a request for a
review of decision has been received within 13 weeks of notification of
the decision, any adjustments to penalty amounts recovered as a result
of the decision must be returned to the job seeker. Financial penalties
for other mutual obligation failures that were not part of the failure
group are not adjusted.

When a failure decision, penalty period or financial penalty is changed,
the Employment Services System (ESS) is electronically notified. The ESS
automatically adjusts the job seeker's Targeted Compliance Framework
zone if required.

Services Australia do not have responsibility for implementing decisions
that are made by providers and have been recorded in the ESS. This
includes a decision to record an invalid reason for a mutual obligation
failure that occurred while a job seeker was in the green or warning
zone that resulted in the application of a demerit.

Job Seeker Compliance Framework decisions

Job Seeker Compliance Framework decisions that may require outcomes
implemented following formal review include:

-   the application of a connection failure, non-attendance failure,
    reconnection failure, No Show, No Pay failure, serious failure or
    Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP)
-   the amount of a non-attendance failure penalty, reconnection failure
    penalty or No Show, No Pay failure penalty
-   the date a penalty period applies from
-   the decision not to make payment under hardship provisions
-   participation payment suspensions applied for not attending an
    appointment or mutual obligation requirement following receipt of a
    Participation Report, Non-Attendance Report (NAR) or a Provider
    Appointment Report (PAR)
-   cancellation for not entering into a Job Plan
-   cancellation for not re-engaging or failing to accept a reconnection
    requirement following a participation payment suspension
-   cancellation when a job seeker has failed to contact their provider
    following submission of a NAR
-   the validity of a NAR and a PAR

Implementing outcomes of Non-Attendance Report (NAR), connection, non-attendance failure, reconnection and No Show, No Pay failure review and appeals

A PST-skilled Service Officer (WNPPD), or for priority reviews an
Appeals Support Team Service Support Officer (WNPPD), is responsible for
implementing the outcomes of NARs, connection, non-attendance failure,
reconnection and No Show, No Pay failure review and appeals.

Payment Pending Review (PPR) is not available for appeals relating to
NARs, connection, non-attendance failure, reconnection and No Show, No
Pay failures. The outcome of these appeals should be implemented within
7 days of the review/appeal decision date.

If the outcome of the review/appeal is to revoke:

-   a job search related connection failure, any subsequent reconnection
    failures and reconnection failure penalties that were applied in the
    sequence of re-engaging the job seeker must also be revoked
-   a NAR, connection failure, non-attendance failure or suspension
    failure as 'invalid', and this was the only valid compliance action
    in the failure sequences prior to a non-attendance failure being
    'applied' or a reconnection failure being 'applied with penalty',
    then any non-attendance failure penalty or reconnection failure
    penalty amount already recovered must be returned to the job seeker
    (provided the appeal was lodged within 13 weeks of the decision
    being notified to the job seeker)
    Note: the reconnection failure is not revoked, but instead becomes a
    connection failure
-   a No Show, No Pay failure, any No Show, No Pay penalty amounts
    already recovered must be returned to the job seeker (provided the
    appeal was lodged within 13 weeks of the decision being notified to
    the job seeker)
-   a reconnection failure and another 'applied with penalty'
    reconnection failure does not exist in the same failure sequence any
    reconnection penalty amounts already recovered must be returned to
    the job seeker (provided the appeal was lodged within 13 weeks of
    the decision being notified to the job seeker)

Implementing outcomes of UNPP or serious failure review and appeals

If the decision to apply an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) or
serious failure can be set aside (the outcome is fully favourable), the
Participation Solutions Team (PST), service centre Subject Matter Expert
(SME) or Appeals Support Team Service Support Officer (priority reviews)
is responsible for finalising the review within the Appeals (APL) system
and updating the failure status and reason. This includes ceasing
Payment Pending Review.

If the outcome of the review/appeal is to revoke the UNPP or serious
failure, the decision must be implemented within 7 days of receiving
implementation instructions. A decision made by the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal (AAT) must only be implemented as directed by the FOI
and Litigation Branch.

If the decision to apply the UNPP or serious failure is an affirmed
decision, and no party is taking further review and appeal action, or
the next stage of review is the AAT second review and a stay order has
not been issued, the UNPP or serious failure penalty period recommences
from the start date of the entitlement period following the one in which
the decision was affirmed provided it is recorded within 13 weeks of the
new decision being made.

A UNPP or serious failure penalty period also recommences from the start
date of the next entitlement period if the job seeker withdraws an
appeal or review, or the AAT dismisses the case without a decision (for
example, in cases when the job seeker does not appear at the hearing or
cannot be contacted).

If a decision to apply a UNPP is affirmed and the job seeker has already
'self-served' part of the UNPP prior to claiming, the job seeker will
only be required to serve the remaining balance of the non-payment
period. If they have not already self-served part of the UNPP, the job
seeker will be required to serve the full UNPP or serious failure
period. However, consideration should be given to eligibility under UNPP
hardship provisions.

If a serious failure period is reapplied following appeal, the PST SME
should discuss with the job seeker the option of attending a waiver
re-engagement appointment with their CDP provider. Job seekers who agree
to attend a waiver re-engagement appointment but do not have the
capacity to attend the appointment and will be in severe financial
hardship because of the serious failure period may be eligible for
payment under hardship provisions.

Implementing outcomes of decision not to pay under hardship provisions

The Participation Solutions Team (PST), service centre Subject Matter
Expert (SME) or Appeals Support Team Service Support Officer (priority
reviews) is responsible for implementing the outcome of decisions not to
make payments under hardship provisions.

If the decision not to make payment under hardship provisions is
revoked, payment should be reinstated from the date the job seeker
became eligible under hardship provisions (provided the appeal was
lodged within 13 weeks of the decision being notified to the job
seeker).

Implementing outcomes relating to participation suspensions

If the outcome of the review of decision is to restore payment when a
payment suspension (participation) exists then payment will be restored
back to the date of effect of the suspension.

Implementing outcomes of decision to cancel payments

When the outcome of the review of decision is to overturn a decision to
cancel a participation payment, payment will be reinstated from the date
of effect of the decision to cancel when the appeal was lodged within 13
weeks of the decision being notified to the job seeker.

This includes decisions to cancel payment as a result of:

-   a work refusal failure
-   an unemployment failure
-   a third mutual obligation failure in the financial penalty zone
-   failing to re-engage, either when the person has not re-engaged
    after being given a re-engagement requirement or the person has not
    made suitable arrangements to re-engage following a payment
    suspension (participation), or
-   failing to enter into a Job Plan or Participation Plan
