|                                   | A PNA only exists until a         |
|                                   | Notional assessment (NA) is made, |
|                                   | usually 23 days after the PNA     |
|                                   | generated, a customer can apply   |
|                                   | to vary the PNA during this       |
|                                   | period. Occasionally, the PNA     |
|                                   | will not become an NA for an      |
|                                   | extended period for example,      |
|                                   | whilst a variation such as a      |
|                                   | Change of Assessment is being     |
|                                   | finalised.                        |

|                                   | When the PNA becomes a NA, the    |
|                                   | parents’ FTB will be calculated   |
|                                   | on the NA, this is the amount of  |
|                                   | child support that would have     |
|                                   | been payable if the agreement was |
|                                   | not in place.                     |

|                                   | After the PNA becomes an NA, an   |
|                                   | NA letter and notice off          |
|                                   | assessment is sent to both        |

|                                   | Service Officers must check that  |

|                                   | possible by amending any details  |

|                                   | ask for a new PNA when their      |
|                                   | circumstances change and they     |
|                                   | want these reflected in the NA    |
|                                   | for FTB purposes, or as a means   |
|                                   | of ending their limited           |
|                                   | agreement, if they expect the new |
|                                   | NA will change by more than 15%   |
|                                   | from the previous NA.             |

|                                   | agreement before generating a new |
|                                   | PNA. If so, the recently issued   |
|                                   | NA may already meet their needs.  |
|                                   | For example, if that recent NA is |

|                                   | days ago, they may already be     |
|                                   | able to make a written election   |
|                                   | to end the limited agreement, and |
|                                   | they may not need another new     |

|                                   | A PNA will be calculated using    |

|                                   | reason, when a PNA is generated   |
|                                   | it is important to ensure that    |

|                                   | income in the Client Income       |

|                                   | window is $43 000. $43 000 x 85%  |
|                                   | = $36 550. Therefore, the         |

|                                   | taxable income must be $36 550 or |
