This document outlines how to process online claims, Assisted Customer
Claims (ACC) and paper CSHC claims. It includes instructions for Process
Direct, and for Customer First when required. It also explains how to
reassess a rejected or cancelled CSHC claim.

Verified income over the income limit but lower this financial year

If a customer's verified income is over the income limit but is likely
to be lower in the current financial year then an estimate of their
income may be taken.

An estimate can only be accepted when a change in circumstances:

-   has already occurred
-   can be satisfactorily demonstrated, and
-   is an acceptable condition for using an estimate of income for the
    CSHC income test
-   and details of verified income that is over the income limit from
    either of the last 2 financial years (reference tax years) has been
    provided and coded

An estimate is reasonable if:

-   the customer's explanation of how they calculated the estimate is
    consistent with the estimated amount, and
-   the reason for the revised income is reasonable and remains an
    acceptable condition for using an estimate of income for the CSHC
    income test (the reasons given are consistent with the reduction in
    income)

Note: when a customer provides an estimate, a superannuation withdrawal
under the First Home Super Saver (FHSS) Scheme is not counted towards
their taxable income.

Re-claim after CSHC rejected/ cancelled due to income estimate

A customer may lodge another claim or re-claim if their CSHC claim is
rejected or their CSHC is cancelled due to an estimate of income
provided for an acceptable condition for the current financial year,
plus any deemed income from account-based income streams.

The customer must provide a revised estimate of the current financial
year with details of why the estimate has changed.

Note: customers cannot lodge a claim or re-claim using income details
previous to the financial year already confirmed.

The revised estimate should only be accepted if it is considered
reasonable and remains an acceptable condition for using an estimate of
income for the CSHC income test.

Care assessment for CSHC claims

Customers advising in the claim of a child entering care need to provide
a completed 'Details of your child's care arrangement (FA012)' before
they can submit their claim.

Where an Assessment of Care Arrangements Referral is required the
assessment must be completed by a suitably skilled Families Service
Officer before the claim can be finalised.

After the care assessment has been completed, Commonwealth Seniors
Health Card processing staff will proceed to claim assessment and
finalisation.

Overseas absence from Australia

If the customer does reclaim CSHC upon their return to Australia, the
CSHC date of claim will be automatically taken as the immigration
advised date of return when:

-   the customer lodges a CSHC re-claim within 14 days of the date of
    return to Australia, and
-   the date of return is less than 26 weeks since their CSHC
    cancellation date

This will apply to CSHC online claims, customised claims, paper claims
and verbal re-claims. Where a customer’s CSHC has been cancelled for
more than 26 weeks they will need to complete a full new claim.

Customer has recently died after lodging a claim

Under some circumstances, claims lodged after the death of a customer
will still need to be determined.

(ATO) website.
