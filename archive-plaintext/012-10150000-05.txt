financial year. There are 4 payment tiers. Note: the maximum payment a
GP can receive in a financial year is $10,000.

If a provider enquires about whether they have met a QSL, escalate the
request to the Programme Support Officer. Do not ask the provider to
send patient information or supporting documents as evidence of their
eligible payment tier. Program Management will advise if further
information from the practice is required.
