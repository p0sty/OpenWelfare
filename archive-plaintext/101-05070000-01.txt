This document outlines information on the role of the CAO for Centrelink
services.

Role of the CAO

The CAO positions were created in 1991 in recognition of the need to
have policy officers who specialise in assessing complex income and
assets test cases, especially cases involving complex financial
arrangements and business structures.

The primary functions and objectives of the CAO are to:

-   undertake assessments of certain categories of cases upon referral.
    The Process page has more information
-   provide information, advice and recommendations to Service Officers,
    Financial Information Service Officers (FISOs), Authorised Review
    Officers (AROs) and Zone Office staff
-   enhance the level of expertise and ability of Service Officers in
    assessing sole trader cases, partnerships, income streams,
    apportionment and self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs)
-   assess training needs, conduct training and information sessions,
    and develop learning aids
-   provide information to accountants, financial advisors, solicitors
    and other third parties

CAO assessments

CAOs make assessments on varying categories of complex casework. They
have specific delegations and responsibilities in the following cases:

-   attribution of income and assets to a customer resulting from their
    involvement with a private company or trust on or after 1 January
    2002
-   approval or rejection of payment under assets hardship rules
-   assessment of Special Disability Trusts
-   assessment of the Home Equity Access Scheme

CAO assessment updates

A CAO assessment remains current until a customer notifies a change in
circumstances.

Undisclosed involvement in a Private Trust or Company

Where a CAO identifies suspected fraud during the course of their
regular duties, they must report the details using the Report Suspected
Fraud and Corruption System. See Report Suspected Fraud and Corruption.
