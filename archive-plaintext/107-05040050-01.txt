This document outlines how to action broken agency recovery
arrangements. The agents are the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA)
or a Ministry in New Zealand.

On this Page:

Debt recovery from DVA payments

Arrangement can be made to recover a debt from the customer's DVA
payments. Services Australia will receive payments electronically every
3 or 6 months. If the customer stops receiving a DVA payment, DVA will
advise the agency.

Debt recovery via Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in New Zealand

Similar arrangements are available for customers who live in New
Zealand. Under the Social Security Agreement between Australia and New
Zealand; MSD in New Zealand arranges the recovery. International
Services (CIS) are responsible for debt recovery requests and
reconciling transfer of funds between MSD and the agency.

Broken arrangements

A payment arrangement is broken if the payment is more than 21 days
late.

DVA management of Social Security payments

There are cases where DVA customers elect to receive their Social
Security payments through DVA instead of the agency. DVA manages
recovery of the customer's Social Security debts. The debts are
passed-on to DVA and become their responsibility. They are not agency
recoveries as described in this procedure.
