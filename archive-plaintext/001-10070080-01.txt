This document outlines the policy and procedures that apply when a job
seeker who is managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework fails to
attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity.

Requirement to attend and satisfactorily participate in compulsory activities

Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, receiving a
participation payment are required to attend and participate in
compulsory activities to help prepare them for the workforce.

The job seeker's Job/Participation Plan sets out the compulsory
activities they must attend and satisfactorily participate in.

Providers have responsibility for negotiating the compulsory activities
included in the Job/Participation Plan with the job seeker. As part of
this negotiation, job seekers should discuss with their provider any
circumstances that have the potential to impact on their ability to
participate.

When negotiating a Job/Participation Plan, the provider must ensure:

-   compulsory activities are consistent with relevant legislation and
    policies
-   compulsory activities do not exceed the maximum hourly limits set in
    social security law
-   the job seeker's circumstances and assessed capacity have been
    appropriately considered

Once the Job/Participation Plan is agreed to, the job seeker is expected
to:

-   attend the activity on the scheduled days
-   be on time, and remain until the completion of the activity
-   satisfactorily participate in the activity
-   record own attendance, where required, and
-   contact before the start time if they are unable to attend

Job seekers who need to arrive late or leave early from an activity on a
specific day should discuss this with their provider or the activity
coordinator beforehand. If the job seeker had a reasonable excuse but
failed to make prior contact to explain why they were unable to attend
an activity, compliance action may still apply.

Requirement to record own attendance

Most job seekers with Workforce Australia or Workforce Australia Online
are responsible for recording their own attendance at compulsory
activities and appointments. Job seekers who are experiencing
difficulties with recording their attendance should discuss this with
their provider. If the provider has determined the job seeker is not
capable of recording or reporting their own attendance, the provider is
responsible for monitoring and recording the job seeker's attendance on
a daily basis.

Where a job seeker who usually records their own attendance is unable to
do so on a particular occasion (for example, due to an internet outage),
they must contact their provider, or the Department Education, Skills
and Employment's Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC) if they are in
Workforce Australia Online, before close of business on the day of the
activity.

Attendance not scheduled on a specific day

When the job seeker fails to comply with a compulsory activity in the
Job/Participation Plan, which does not require attendance on a specific
day, a mutual obligation failure is committed at the end of that
fortnight. For example, when the job seeker does not undertake their
compulsory activity to do 20 hours of private study per fortnight a
mutual obligation failure is committed.

Inappropriate conduct while participating in a compulsory activity

Job seekers are required to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner
while participating in an activity.

When inappropriate conduct occurs while participating in a compulsory
activity, the job seeker will be managed using Targeted Compliance
Framework.

Misconduct or inappropriate conduct means failing to behave in
accordance with the standards that would be expected in a workplace.
This includes, but is not limited to:

-   not following reasonable instructions
-   being disruptive or uncooperative
-   behaving in a manner that is aggressive, violent or offensive
-   harassing other people
-   behaving in a manner that causes risk to the health and safety of
    themselves or other participants
-   being intoxicated or consuming intoxicants during the activity
-   behaving in a manner that may harm the reputation of the program

Generally, this type of behaviour is only considered inappropriate when
serious in nature, deliberate and within the job seeker's control.

If Services Australia establishes the behaviour was not in the job
seeker's control, free text is sent to the provider to ensure this can
be considered for future servicing.

Managing non-compliance when a job seeker fails to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity

When a job seeker fails to attend or satisfactorily participate in a
compulsory activity, a mutual obligation failure has been committed.
When a job seeker is required to record their own attendance but fails
to do so, including when they attend but forget to record, a mutual
obligation failure has also been committed.

Job seekers in the green or warning zone will accrue one demerit if the
provider is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason for failing
to attend or satisfactorily participate in a compulsory activity. When
the provider is able to establish that the job seeker attended but
failed to record their attendance, a demerit will not be applied.

Job seekers in the financial penalty zone will incur a financial
penalty, unless:

-   their provider closes the Non-Compliance Report (NCR) because they
    are satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason
-   Services Australia conducts a compliance investigation and
    establishes that the job seeker has a reasonable excuse and prior
    contact was made or was unable to be made. Participation Solutions
    Team (PST) skilled Service Officers are responsible for conducting
    these compliance investigations
