|                                   | will allocate funds according to  |
|                                   | their instructions, However, with |
|                                   | payments being made to an         |
|                                   | un-contracted TPO, there may be   |
|                                   | some risk associated with         |
|                                   | recovery of the payment if they   |
|                                   | do not spend all the funds being  |
|                                   | transferred for them, or if they  |
|                                   | change their mind about the       |
|                                   | purchase. Ensure the customer is  |
|                                   | certain of their request before   |
|                                   | proceeding.                       |
