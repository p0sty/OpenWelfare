|                                   | Answer: DAP is counted as         |
|                                   | ordinary income for calculating   |
|                                   | the rate of income support        |

|                                   | This means if the customer        |

|                                   | an ISP, the ISP rate will reduce  |
|                                   | during the DAP entitlement        |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | If the ISP reduces to a zero rate |
|                                   | due to DAP, the ISP will cancel.  |
|                                   | The customer must lodge a new     |
|                                   | claim if they wish to re test     |
|                                   | their eligibility for an ISP.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the DAP nominated start date   |
|                                   | is backdated to a date that falls |
|                                   | within a period for which an ISP  |
|                                   | has already been paid to the      |
|                                   | customer (and/or their partner),  |
|                                   | an ISP overpayment will be        |
|                                   | raised.                           |

|                                   | Darren has claimed and has been   |
|                                   | paid DAP and had a nominated      |

|                                   | advise of the requirement to      |
|                                   | travel interstate on 9 February   |
|                                   | as a relative was hospitalised.   |

|                                   | Darren's wife and new baby did    |

|                                   | queries whether eligibility will  |
