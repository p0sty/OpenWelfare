|                                   | 22 January 2018, Chris was paid   |
|                                   | annual leave of approximately 9   |
|                                   | days but was unsure if this was   |
|                                   | from leave prior to Workcover     |
|                                   | period or accrued leave whilst    |

|                                   | Melbourne returning to the        |
|                                   | parental home and the employer    |
|                                   | took this to mean Chris walked    |
|                                   | out of the apprenticeship. Chris  |
|                                   | wants to use the compensation     |
|                                   | amount to go towards being        |

|                                   | injury (or lack of sick leave     |
|                                   | entitlements) would have          |
|                                   | continued to work and be paid by  |
|                                   | the employer.                     |

|                                   | Centrelink will assess the value  |
|                                   | of the compensation payments as   |
|                                   | an entitlement arising from paid  |
|                                   | work, therefore it will be        |
|                                   | assessed as contributing towards  |
|                                   | the income amount required for    |
|                                   | independence under s1067A(10)(c)  |
