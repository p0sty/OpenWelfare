| 1                                 | Family Tax Benefit (FTB) lump sum |

|                                   | lump sum claim, they have not     |
|                                   | lodged a claim for FTB for the    |
|                                   | past 5 years. During coding of    |
|                                   | the claim it is noticed there is  |
|                                   | no percentage of care recorded    |
|                                   | for their son James who is in     |
|                                   | their care 100% of the time.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, care does not need  |
|                                   | to be coded for James unless      |
|                                   | there has been a change in care   |
|                                   | as advised by the customer or     |

|                                   | Sarah. This is the first time     |
|                                   | Peter has claimed FTB so Sarah is |
|                                   | added to the system. As Sarah is  |
|                                   | in the care of parents only, the  |
|                                   | FTB Shared Care (FSC) screen must |
|                                   | be coded to reflect 100% care.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, the care must be    |
|                                   | coded even though it is for 100%  |
|                                   | care.                             |

|                                   | The intent of this requirement is |
|                                   | to have a percentage of care for  |
|                                   | the child coded at all times. If  |
|                                   | the parents separate in the       |
|                                   | future, this means the percentage |
|                                   | must be reviewed when completing  |
|                                   | the separation updates instead of |
|                                   | allowing the system to assume     |

PPL ACS coding

An update may be required to the AC screen when processing a PPL only
claim and the customer has advised a change in marital status. If the AC
screen has previously been coded, a new line of AC coding will be
required. The update required to the AC screen depends on what is
already known on the record.
