Review of change of assessment (COA) application

Effective 16 December 2014, COA applications cannot be lodged on cases
where the assessment has ended for the child.

On 1 July 2015 the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) merged with
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to form the new AAT. Prior to
this date SSAT had the jurisdiction to review most child support
objection decisions. Reference to previous or pending AAT decisions in
this procedure includes previous reviews conducted by SSAT.
