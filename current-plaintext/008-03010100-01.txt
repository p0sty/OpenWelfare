This document explains how to stream a DSP new claim lodged via online
claim, Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) or paper claim form. Paper claims
include a Claim for DSP (SA466) or DSP Claim at age 16 (SA439).

Assessment of medical evidence by the Medical Assessment Team (MAT)

When a DSP online or ACC is submitted, or a paper claim is lodged and
scanned, a Work Item is created and allocated to the Medical Assessment
Team (MAT) for assessment of medical evidence.

The DSP new claim activity will automatically be placed ‘On Hold’
awaiting assessment of medical evidence and completion of the MAT
recommendation.

The MAT is responsible for checking and assessing all medical evidence
and providing a recommendation to Disability Processing staff. When a
claim is submitted without medical evidence, the MAT assessor will
exercise judgement and attempt to obtain medical evidence if the
customer is likely manifestly medically eligible or vulnerable. A
Contributing Assessor may be used to provide discipline specific input
to the assessment.

The MAT assesses medical evidence and recommends if:

-   the customer satisfies manifest medical eligibility criteria
-   the customer is manifestly medically ineligible
-   there is insufficient medical evidence to assess the functional
    impact of the customer's medical condition/s
-   there is a current and valid Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) that can
    be used to determine the claim, or
-   a JCA is required to assess medical eligibility

MAT will complete an assessment of Continuing Inability to Work (CITW)
in an initial referral if manifest eligibility is recommended.

Fast Note for DSP claims due to coronavirus (COVID-19) impacts

MAT will record a Fast Note > DSP health emergency impact:

-   where a customer's medical evidence indicates they are claiming
    because of the medical impacts of COVID-19
-   for data purposes only, no action required by staff

Streaming

When the DSP new claim, including SA494 Claims for Terminal Illness, is
allocated, the Service Officer must:

-   check if the MAT has completed an assessment of medical evidence
-   create a MAT referral if an assessment of medical evidence has not
    been completed
-   check the MAT recommendation to see if the claim can be finalised
    without further assessment. For example, an assessment of
    non-medical eligibility may not be required if the customer is
    assessed as manifestly medically ineligible and they, or their
    partner (if relevant), are not receiving another income support
    payment
-   review the customer's personal circumstances, claim and associated
    documents to make sure all appropriate information is available to
    progress the claim

When streaming the claim, contact is only required when:

-   there are complex issues
-   the customer is vulnerable or at risk and requires support to manage
    the claim process and more information is required
-   a SA495 (Verification of Terminal Illness) only is received and
    indicates the average life expectancy of a person with the condition
    is more than 3 months (or it is not clear)
-   the customer has indicated in their claim they, and/or their
    partner, have ceased work, are yet to receive their final pay and
    confirmation of details is required

Note: for customers in vulnerable circumstances, see Intent to claim and
vulnerable customers.

Immediately process claims that can be finalised at streaming.

If the customer has not provided all required information, run the
Request for Information guided procedure for paper claims to issue them
with a Requesting information (CLK) letter.

For online claims, use the Request and Manage Customer Tasks guided
procedure to request documents, see Circumstance Change Monitor (CCM).

If a customer has lodged a claim and there are outstanding tasks to
complete, or requested documents are not provided within the required
timeframe, reject the claim.

Hold to User

Refer to the Hold to User new claim criteria if the DSP customer is
vulnerable, identified as manifestly eligible or has complex
circumstances.

Customer Critical Response Team

If significant changes occur during the streaming or processing of the
claim, such as admission to psychiatric confinement or in prison, or
death of the customer, follow CCRT referral guidelines for appropriate
cases before referring the case to the Customer Critical Response Team
(CCRT) for management. Referrals must be made in consultation with a
Team Leader. To make referrals to the CCRT, see the Resources page.

Terminal illness

At any stage before finalisation of the DSP claim, a customer, nominee,
or the customer's Treating Health Professional (THP) may advise in
writing or over the phone their condition is terminal and their life
expectancy is less than 2 years. Staff who receive a Priority-Poss TRM
NCL in Prog work item or a MAT recommendation indicating a terminal
illness, must follow the required actions on the Process page.

Identity Confirmation

Identities with a confirmed status provide a higher level of confidence
in the claimed identity. Establishing a person’s identity increases
security and reduces identity fraud and privacy risks for the customer
and Services Australia.

Customers can get a Confirmed Identity by:

-   providing the required identity documents, and completing a facial
    comparison (linkage) in person with Services Australia, or
-   Centrelink accepting their IP3 Digital Identity, and it displays as
    confirmed in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard in Process Direct

In some cases, customers may require help to Confirm their Identity.
Customers who cannot confirm their identity must complete an Alternative
identity assessment:

-   in person, or
-   by phone if they cannot attend in person, when they have a valid
    reason

A nominee can provide the customer’s Identity documents on behalf of the
customer. They can do this:

-   in person
-   online, or
-   by phone

A nominee can also complete an Alternative Identity assessment for the
customer if they cannot do so and have a genuine reason. For example,
customer is profoundly disabled or incapacitated.

If a customer has an identity status of ‘Not Confirmed’ and the customer
has advised they can provide Identity Confirmation, consider if an
Identity Review Period can be applied. If an Identity Review Period has
been applied, do not delay referrals for a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA)
if all non-medical eligibility has been confirmed.

Cancellation of FTB and DOP - DSP claim lodged by young person

Staff must make sure Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Double Orphan Pension
(DOP) is cancelled for a child who is 16 to 19 years following the
lodgement of a claim for DSP if it is not granted or rejected
immediately.

On lodgement of a DSP claim, the system will auto cancel the FTB portion
for the child. If the FTB recipient is only receiving FTB for the child
claiming DSP, it will cause the FTB to cancel Dependant Receiving
Precluding Payment (DPP). If the FTB recipient is receiving FTB for
multiple children, the FTB part A portion for the child claiming payment
will cancel. When auto-cancellation does not occur, a Change of
Circumstances (CoC) work item will be created.

Services Australia has a responsibility under section 28B of the FA
(Admin) Act, to check that FTB is cancelled for a child who makes a
claim for a social security payment or pension. If FTB is not cancelled,
and DSP is subsequently granted at a later stage, an overpayment of FTB
and/or DOP may occur.

If the DSP customer is receiving Double Orphan Pension (DOP), FTB
cancellation will also cancel DOP. On cancellation of the DOP, a work
item is created and sent to region code DOP to notify of DOP
cancellation. If auto cancellation does not occur, a work item is
created and sent to DOP for follow up.

Start dates

Customers who are qualified and payable are generally granted from the
date they submit a complete claim with all relevant supporting
documentation. See Calculating the start day general rule.

Intent to claim provisions may apply to customers in vulnerable
circumstances, see Intent to claim and vulnerable customers. After
determining the date a claim was made, staff can assess if backdating
provisions apply.

Customers can lodge an early claim for DSP up to 13 weeks before the
first day of eligibility. Early claim provisions may apply to customers
who are turning 16, see Claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP). If an
early claim lodgement is accepted, the start date is the first day the
customer becomes qualified for the payment. See Early claims.

From 7 December 2020, employment income paid after the start date must
be assessed for the same period for which it is paid by the employer.
Where the income is too high for the customer to be payable, but the
customer will become payable within 13 weeks of the date they lodged the
claim, move the start date to the earliest Entitlement Period Start Date
from which the customer is payable.

Duplicate claims

A customer can lodge a claim for Disability Support Pension (DSP) at any
time. If a customer lodges a DSP claim within the qualification period
(for example, 13 weeks) of a previously submitted DSP claim, Service
Officers need to determine how each claim should be progressed. Service
Officers must attempt to contact the customer or nominee to establish
their reason or intent in lodging a second claim. Customer can choose to
pursue all submitted claims, but they can also choose to withdraw the
claim. See Cancel or Withdraw online claim and Withdrawal of claims. If
required, Service Officers can refer to Level 2 Policy Helpdesk for
appropriate policy clarification.

Impairment Table changes from 1 April 2023

From 1 April 2023, a new version of Impairment Tables was introduced.
The new Tables are used to assess a customer's medical eligibility for
all DSP claims lodged on or after this date. See The Impairment Tables.
