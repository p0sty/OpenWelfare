PDF version of Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) – residential aged care services

A PDF version of an Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) for a
residential care recipient is not currently available through the Aged
Care Provider Portal (ACPP) and Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP).

If a residential aged care service requires a PDF version of a care
recipient’s ACFI, Service Officers are to instruct the aged care service
provider:

-   open the relevant page from the ACFI summary screen for the relevant
    care recipient in ACPP
-   press the control and P buttons on the keyboard (Ctrl + P)
-   under the ‘printer’ dropdown (for Microsoft Edge) or ‘destination’
    dropdown (for Google Chrome, select ‘save as PDF’
-   select the ‘save’ button at the bottom of the popup screen
-   save the relevant page of the ACFI on the desktop or in a folder
    that is easy to access

Repeat the above steps for any other pages of the ACFI and/or for other
care recipients.
