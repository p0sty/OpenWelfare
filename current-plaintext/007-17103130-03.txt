|                                   | CCS customers may ask to cancel   |
|                                   | CCS to reduce the chance of an    |
|                                   | overpayment and claim any extra   |
|                                   | CCS after the end of the income   |
|                                   | year. These customers should be   |
|                                   | encouraged to increase their      |
|                                   | withholdings. There is no         |
|                                   | availability to claim CCS as a    |
|                                   | lump sum after the end of the     |

|                                   | CCS customers may also ask to     |
|                                   | cancel CCS for a child as they no |
|                                   | longer intend to use child care.  |
|                                   | The cancellation date is date of  |
|                                   | notification and is not to be     |

|                                   | be restored and a new claim must  |
