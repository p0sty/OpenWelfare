This document contains information to assist in determining eligibility
in Medicare for overseas enrolments.

Reciprocal health country

If the customer has come from Reciprocal Health Care Agreements (RHCA)
country, they may have access to Medicare. See Reciprocal Health Care
Agreements (RHCA) eligibility for Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits
Scheme (PBS) for a current list of countries.

To enrol in Medicare under an RHCA, the person must meet the RHCA
conditions for the country they were last residing in, before coming to
Australia. Exception applies to Italy and the Netherlands.

Note: a person's citizenship is not an indicator of their country of
residence.

permanent residency visa or permanent protection visa and:

have permission to work

-   are in a relationship with a parent, de facto, spouse or child who
    is an Australian or New Zealand citizen, or holds a permanent
    resident visa and resides in Australia
-   were residing in a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) country
    immediately before coming to Australia, and meet the criteria of
