This document outlines the roles and responsibilities of providers and
Services Australia in managing job seeker compliance with compulsory
requirements. Note: the term 'job seeker' in this file also refers to
Community Development Program (CDP) participants.

Introduction

The primary aim of both providers and Services Australia in managing job
seeker compliance with compulsory requirements is to keep job seekers
actively engaged with employment services and their compulsory
requirements.

In this topic, 'providers' refers to:

-   Workforce Australia providers
-   Workforce Australia Online
-   Community Development Program (CDP) providers
-   Disability Employment Services

The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has primary
responsibility for the legislation and policy that supports the job
seeker compliance system.

National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) is responsible for the
Community Development Program (CDP), which provides employment services
to job seekers in remote Australia.

The Department of Social Services is responsible for Disability
Employment Services (DES).

Provider responsibilities in managing compliance using the Targeted Compliance Framework

Most job seekers receiving a participation payment are managed under the
Targeted Compliance Framework, including job seekers who receive
employment services from:

-   Workforce Australia providers
-   Workforce Australia Online
-   Disability Employment Services (DES)

Providers have responsibility for:

-   ensuring that the job seeker's compulsory requirements are
    reasonable based on their individual circumstances and assessed
    capacity
-   ensuring job seekers are aware of the tools available to manage and
    record attendance at requirements and completion of tasks
-   monitoring compliance with compulsory requirements, recording mutual
    obligation failures and recording potential work refusal or
    unemployment failures
-   notifying reengagement requirements and recording when the job
    seeker complies, or is no longer required to comply with
    reengagement requirements
-   conducting Capability Interviews where a job seeker accrues either 3
    demerit points in 6 months or is fast tracked to the equivalent
    point

Provider responsibilities in managing compliance using the Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Job seekers in remote areas of Australia receive employment services
from Community Development Program (CDP) providers and are managed under
the Job Seeker Compliance Framework.

CDP providers have responsibility for:

-   negotiating individually tailored Job Plans/Participation Plans and
    ensuring job seekers receive proper notification of compulsory
    requirements
-   ensuring job seekers are aware of their obligations and the
    consequences of non-compliance, including advising payments may stop
    if they fail to comply with their requirements
-   considering whether or not compliance action is required
-   pursuing compliance action by submitting a Non-Attendance Report,
    Provider Appointment Report or a Participation Report to Services
    Australia
-   arranging waiver re-engagement appointments for the purpose of
    waiving all or part of a serious failure penalty

Services Australia responsibilities

The Services Australia system automatically suspends participation
payments when various suspension reports are received from providers.
This includes Non-Compliance Reports, Non-Attendance Reports and
Participation Reports. All of these reports are accepted through the
automatic validation processes.

For job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework,
Services Australia has responsibility for:

-   conducting Capability Assessments where a job seeker accrues either
    5 demerit points in 6 months or is fast tracked to the equivalent
    point
-   determining whether a work refusal failure or unemployment failure
    has been committed
-   investigating non-compliance when a job seeker in the financial
    penalty zone commits a mutual obligation failure
-   calculating and applying financial penalties where appropriate
-   determining payment start dates following an unemployment preclusion
    period

For job seekers managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework,
Services Australia has responsibility for:

investigating and decision making relating to:

-   connection failures
-   No-Show, No Pay failures
-   non-attendance failures
-   reconnection failures
-   serious failures, and
-   Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP)

conducting Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA)

calculating and recovering payment penalties, and

determining the eligibility for waiver and hardship provisions for
serious failure periods or UNPPs

Services Australia is also responsible for the review and appeals
process for decisions made under Social Security Legislation for both
compliance systems.
