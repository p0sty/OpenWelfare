This document outlines how to identify who is responsible for repaying
the PPL debt and to apportion Parental Leave Pay (PPL) debts between
employer and employee.

Debt liability

Overpaid amounts of PPL are recoverable. This includes amounts paid
resulting from administrative error.

A PPL debt may be raised against:

-   the employer
-   the employee, or
-   both employee and employer

If an employee gets PPL from their employer and they are no longer
eligible for PPL, if Services Australia is not informed, the employer
will continue to get the employee's PPL payments.

Whoever holds the PPL funds will be responsible for repaying the debt.
The:

-   employer will have a debt raised for any PPL they have not yet paid
    to the employee
-   employee will have a debt for any PPL they have received. Amounts
    deducted for Pay As You Go (PAYG) or other reasons will be included
    in the debt to the employee
