This document outlines introductory information about the BasicsCard,
including eligibility, issuing, use, replacement and online service
options.

BasicsCard purpose

The BasicsCard is a reusable card, which allows customers to use their
income managed funds to purchase goods and services at approved
BasicsCard merchants through the Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of
Sale (EFTPOS) network. The card has a Personal Identification Number
(PIN) for security.

The BasicsCard is another allocation method for income managed funds.
However, it will not replace the need to assess and review the priority
needs of income managed customers.

Eligibility for BasicsCard

All income managed customers are eligible to receive a BasicsCard to
access their income managed funds to purchase goods and services at
approved merchants.

Issuing BasicsCards

A BasicsCard can be issued by:

-   Service Officers at Centrelink service centres
-   remote service centres or by a Remote Servicing Team (RST)
-   calling the Income Management Line. It will be posted to the
    customer’s mailing address

For additional assistance in issuing a BasicsCard, Service Officers can
call the Technical Support Line.

How the BasicsCard works

The BasicsCard operates through the EFTPOS network at approved
BasicsCard merchants. The BasicsCard will not operate at an Automated
Teller Machine (ATM). The BasicsCard can only be used at an ATM for
balance-checking.

When making a purchase the customer will swipe the BasicsCard, press
'savings' and enter their PIN to complete the purchase.

Customers will receive a receipt once the transaction is finalised, no
cash out or cash refunds are allowed. All BasicsCard purchases or
refunds must be done through the EFTPOS network, no manual or offline
transactions are permitted if EFTPOS is down.

Where the BasicsCard can be used

The BasicsCard can only be used through registered EFTPOS facilities at
approved BasicsCard merchants. These are stores or businesses that have
applied and been approved to accept the BasicsCard.

BasicsCard merchants will display BasicsCard stickers and posters in
their window to assist customers to identify where their BasicsCard can
be used. The larger National BasicsCard merchants may not have these
window stickers and posters displayed. The Resources page contains a
list National Merchants who accept BasicsCard.

A search tool is available on the Services Australia website for
customers to search for approved BasicsCard merchants in a specified
area.

The Resources page contains a link to the Organisation Finder service
for customers. For information on how to use this search tool, see
Business and organisation search tools.

See BasicsCard merchant information, eligibility and approval to assist
merchants wishing to apply to be a BasicsCard merchant or to assist
existing merchants experiencing any issues.

Allocating funds to the BasicsCard

All customers will have funds transferred in to their BasicsCard account
in one of two models - the Residual Payment method or the Partial
Payment method.

Customers are able to change their BasicsCard allocation method by
contacting the agency.

Customers can also allocate funds to their BasicsCard through [] online
services or by contacting Services Australia. See Coding Income
Management Expenses for more information on allocating funds to the
BasicsCard.

Note: BasicsCard is not an available allocation method for school meals,
rent (except short-term accommodation) and utilities. These expenses
should continue to be paid via the direct deduction facility and Expense
Requests.

Conditions of use

The BasicsCard cannot be used to purchase the following excluded goods
and services:

-   alcohol, home brew concentrate, or home brew kits
-   tobacco products
-   pornography
-   gambling services or products

The BasicsCard cannot be used to obtain cash (either at point of sale or
via an ATM), cash refunds or gift cards or vouchers (which could result
in the purchase of one of the above excluded goods).

Lay-by purchases are available at BasicsCard merchants, but these must
be offered in accordance with the requirements of 'Approved Lay-Bys'
under the BasicsCard Merchant Terms and Conditions. These requirements
include the provision of a lay-by terms and conditions document and a
detailed lay-by docket by the merchant to the customer. The Resources
page contains a link to the BasicsCard Merchant Terms and Conditions.

Customers who are no longer on Income Management (IM) can still allocate
funds to their BasicsCard for up to 60 days. Any regular allocations to
the BasicsCard will continue to deliver during this period if the
customer has sufficient funds and an active card. After this time, the
BasicsCard account is closed and any remaining funds are recalled into
the customer's Income Management account to be disbursed.

Spend and balance limits for BasicsCard

There is a daily spend and maximum balance limit for the card:

-   Daily Spend Limit is automatically set at $1,500. A customer can
    request to set this limit between $20 and $1,500. If the BasicsCard
    daily spend limit is reached for a 24 hour period (midnight to
    midnight), the customer will be required to wait until midnight
    before the daily spend limit resets and additional purchases using
    their BasicsCard can be made
-   Maximum Card Balance is automatically set at $3,000. A customer can
    request to set this limit between $100 and $3,000. A customer may
    request to lower the daily spend or maximum card balance limits of
    their BasicsCard, however, if that customer is deemed as
    'vulnerable', appropriate referrals should be made. Service Officers
    should ensure a full assessment of the customer's circumstances is
    undertaken and any appropriate referrals made

For more information, see BasicsCard changing daily spend and maximum
card balance limits.

Customer is outside of their normal area

The BasicsCard is a useful method to access income managed funds when a
customer is travelling away from home. There are stores and businesses
across Australia where customers can use their BasicsCard. Customers can
search for approved merchants using the Express Plus Centrelink mobile
app on their mobile device or using the search tool on Services
Australia website.

As all Centrelink Service Centres now have BasicsCard stocks, customers
can attend any service centre to have a new or replacement BasicsCard
issued.

Nominees and the BasicsCard

A BasicsCard can be issued to a payment nominee on behalf of a customer.
A payment nominee can also control transfer to the card on behalf of the
customer.
