This document outlines the assessment process for Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) enrolment checks.

Enrolment checks

AIC students are subject to enrolment checks each term.

Details received from education providers may show one or more of the
following. The student:

-   is not enrolled at the recorded education provider
-   has ceased studies
-   did not start studies
-   started studies late
-   changed study load

Use the enrolment check to determine the student's eligibility during
their course of study.

Reassessment of AIC entitlement may occur at any time when additional
information is received by Services Australia.

Start of enrolment checks

The education provider that is recorded in the ‘Institution’ field on
the student's Customer Study Details (EDC) screen in Process Direct or
Education Details (EDC) screen in Customer First determines if AIC
enrolment checks will be issued electronically or as a manual paper
form.

AIC enrolment checks are issued:

Electronically, through the Integrated Review System (IRS) for:

-   SA Secondary government schools
-   QLD, WA, TAS and ACT Primary and Secondary government schools

Manual paper forms for:

-   NSW, VIC and NT Primary and Secondary government schools
-   SA Primary government schools
-   all non-government schools

Customer contact

Make 2 genuine contact attempts to contact the applicant to confirm the
student's circumstances when a discrepancy is identified in the
enrolment response.

Service Officers can re-assess AIC payment(s), where the applicant:

-   confirms the details in the enrolment check
-   can provide a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy, or
-   says the student was impacted by circumstances beyond their control

Verification documents are needed when the applicant does not meet one
of the above criteria.

If the applicant cannot be contacted by phone issue written notification
to the applicant.

AIC applicants have up to 29 days (14 days to respond plus 15 additional
delivery days for remote applicants) to contact from the date the
information is requested. If the applicant fails to contact Services
Australia within this period, their AIC payment for that student may be
stopped.

Verification

Where evidence is needed, issue a Request for Information (Q781) letter.
Ask the applicant to provide the documents within 14 days.

Third parties and applicants have an obligation to provide the
information under section 343 of the Student Assistance Act 1973.

Cancelling an Enrolment Check

Enrolment checks are non-discretionary reviews. Only AIC-skilled Service
Officers should cancel them.

Third party debts

AIC Scheme debts may be the responsibility of a third party. This could
be an educational institution, parent or guardian. Check to confirm
which party directly received the payment.
