This document outlines the information a customer in receipt of
Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP) must provide when they and/or their
partner commence or return to work, the effect their employment will
have on their payment, and additional assistance that may be available.

Reporting requirements

PPP customers and/or their partner who are commencing or returning to
full-time, part-time or casual work must notify within 14 days to avoid
being paid an incorrect amount.

The customer must be placed on statement reporting to ensure they are
paid the correct rate of PPP, where the customer and/or their partner
has commenced employment.

If the customer's partner reports using their online account or the
Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, the customer must ensure their own
employment income is included in their partner's report. The partner
will be returned to two weekly reporting if currently reporting less
frequently.

A customer with employment income must be directed to the Services
Australia website for more information about income and reporting. The
priority reporting line and the self service options for reporting must
be discussed.

Reporting requirements must be manually recorded if the customer and/or
their partner has employment income.

Self-service

[]PPP customers without ParentsNext requirements who have commenced or
returned to work, or have ceased employment are able to update their
employment status through their Centrelink online account or Express
Plus Centrelink mobile app. This will automatically place them onto or
turn off two weekly reporting requirement.

Eligible customers can also update their partner's employment status
when partner:

-   does not receive an income support payment
-   who receives an income support payment other than Disability Support
    Pension has given customer permission to enquire
-   receives Age Pension (Blind) or Disability Support Pension (Blind)
    with Rent Assistance

Return to work incentives

Customers can accrue Working Credits during fortnights of little or no
income and then use their Working Credit balance to increase the gross
amount they can be paid before PPP begins to reduce.

Once Working Credits are depleted, customers can be paid gross
employment income up to their income free area before their payments
start to reduce under the income test.

Assistance can continue during an employment income nil rate period,
including Family Tax Benefit (FTB), a Health Care Card (HCC)/Pensioner
Concession Card (PCC), and Telephone Allowance.

Cancellation of payments

The customer can request immediate cancellation of their income support
payment at any time.

Documenting details of employment income

All details of employment income - itemised weekly wage amounts,
calculations, and anything else concerning the advice must be documented
in full.

Full-time Australian Apprentice

Full-time Australian Apprentices may be eligible for ABSTUDY, Austudy or
Youth Allowance. This may be a more advantageous payment for the
customer as the student income and asset tests apply.

Family assistance

Check if the customer needs to revise their annual income estimate
and/or payment choice for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Subsidy
(CCS) to reduce the risk of an overpayment during the reconciliation
process.

Parents must also advise a return to work after a period caring for a
child to check their entitlement to the FTB Part B quarantine.

Work/training/study test details may need to be updated for the CCS
eligible hour limit.
