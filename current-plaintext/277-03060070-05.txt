|                                   |     Kate’s care has decreased so  |
|                                   |     it will take effect in the    |
|                                   |     assessment from 3 March 2021. |
|                                   |     As Suzie’s level of care has  |
|                                   |     increased and it was notified |
|                                   |     more than 28 days after the   |
|                                   |     event. Suzie’s increased care |
|                                   |     will be applied in the        |
|                                   |     assessment from 19 April 2021 |
|                                   | -   family assistance assessment  |
|                                   |     from 3 March 2021 being the   |

| 6                                 | Example 6                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mum and Dad equally share the     |
|                                   | care of 1 child (50% each). The   |
|                                   | child then moves into 100% care   |
|                                   | of an aunt, who is not a party to |
|                                   | the current assessment. This is a |
|                                   | terminating event for the current |
|                                   | child support assessment as both  |
|                                   | Mum and Dad cease to be eligible  |
|                                   | carers because their percentage   |
|                                   | of care has fallen to 0%.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a terminating event occurs,  |
|                                   | the assessment must change from   |
|                                   | the date of event even if the     |
|                                   | agency is notified after 28 days. |
|                                   | Mum and Dad would also lose their |
|                                   | entitlement to FTB for the child  |
|                                   | and the aunt will have the option |
|                                   | of making a claim.                |
