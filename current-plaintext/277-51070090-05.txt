|                                   | Wendy had a child in September    |
|                                   | 2015 and failed to take           |
|                                   | maintenance action for the child. |
|                                   | Over the years, Wendy was in      |
|                                   | contact with Services Australia   |
|                                   | many times advising of the wish   |
|                                   | to apply for a parentage unknown  |
|                                   | exemption. Wendy was not aware    |
|                                   | who the father was. On many       |
|                                   | occasions, Wendy even attended    |
|                                   | social worker appointments to     |
|                                   | request an exemption.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On each occasion, Wendy was       |
|                                   | advised of the need to provide    |
|                                   | the child's birth certificate to  |
|                                   | show that the father was not      |
|                                   | named. Wendy's FTB increased      |
|                                   | several times because of these    |
|                                   | discussions. This was due to      |
|                                   | Wendy advising the birth          |
|                                   | certificate would be supplied     |
|                                   | within the specified timeframe.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In November 2020, Wendy again     |
|                                   | contacted and requested an        |
|                                   | exemption. Wendy was again        |
|                                   | advised of the need to provide    |
|                                   | the child's birth certificate. In |
|                                   | December 2020, Wendy provided the |
|                                   | child's birth certificate showing |
|                                   | the father was not named.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The social worker assessing       |
|                                   | Wendy's case requested that the   |
|                                   | exemption be backdated to the     |
|                                   | child's date of birth in 2015.    |
|                                   | The reason is the identity of the |
|                                   | father had been unknown from      |
|                                   | then.                             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | established before the exemption  |
|                                   | can be backdated to the child's   |
|                                   | date of birth in 2015 because:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the exemption was requested   |
|                                   |     in the 2020-21 financial year |
|                                   |     and                           |
|                                   | -   the social worker is          |
|                                   |     recommending the exemption be |
|                                   |     backdated to September 2015,  |
|                                   |     which is before the start of  |
|                                   |     the previous financial year   |
|                                   |     (1 July 2019)                 |

|                                   | The case is referred to the       |

|                                   | when Ebony was granted a MAT      |
|                                   | exemption due to violence (VIO).  |
|                                   | Recently however Ebony's income   |
|                                   | has increased substantially,      |

|                                   | Note: As Carolyn does not have a  |

|                                   | $19,500pa was collected by Wendy. |

|                                   | advises that John has refused to  |
|                                   | pay the child support arrears     |
|                                   | privately and Wendy has changed   |
|                                   | to Child Support collect. The     |
|                                   | reason is John has refused to pay |
|                                   | the new assessment ongoing. Wendy |
|                                   | is advised that it may be best to |
|                                   | seek legal advice.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Wendy contacts a legal            |
|                                   | practitioner, and they advise     |
|                                   | that it would not be cost         |
|                                   | effective for them to help. John  |
|                                   | has declared bankruptcy.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Wendy obtains a letter from the   |
|                                   | legal practitioner, which         |
|                                   | confirms they cannot help. Wendy  |
|                                   | presents this letter to           |
|                                   | Centrelink. Wendy is referred to  |
|                                   | a Social Worker to apply for a    |
|                                   | partial exemption for the years   |
|                                   | 2014/2015-2017/2018. Reason is    |
|                                   | ‘other exceptional                |
|                                   | circumstances’. For Wendy, the    |
|                                   | exceptional circumstance is       |
|                                   | gaining legal assistance was      |
|                                   | attempted, however it is not cost |
|                                   | effective for the legal           |
|                                   | practitioner to pursue the        |
|                                   | arrears.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Social Worker grants a        |
