|                                   | Australia provider and has        |
|                                   | committed multiple mutual         |
|                                   | obligation failures in one        |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A first and a second mutual       |
|                                   | obligation failure (MOF) for      |
|                                   | non-compliance with a compulsory  |
|                                   | requirement may be applied in the |
|                                   | same instalment period for the    |
|                                   | job seeker. A third MOF however,  |
|                                   | cannot be applied in an           |
|                                   | instalment period where the       |
|                                   | second MOF has already been       |
|                                   | applied:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   The first applied mutual      |
|                                   |     obligation failure results in |
|                                   |     a payment reduction of 50%    |
|                                   |     and Zinnia must still meet    |
|                                   |     all of their compulsory       |
|                                   |     requirements                  |
|                                   | -   A second applied mutual       |
|                                   |     obligation failure results in |
|                                   |     a payment reduction of 100%.  |
|                                   |     Zinnia will not receive a     |
|                                   |     participation payment for     |
|                                   |     this fortnight, but must      |
|                                   |     still meet all of their       |
|                                   |     mutual obligation             |

|                                   | -   A third mutual obligation     |
|                                   |     failure cannot be applied for |
|                                   |     an instalment period where a  |
|                                   |     100% payment reduction has    |
|                                   |     already been applied          |
|                                   | -   Despite applied penalties,    |
|                                   |     Zinnia will still need to     |
|                                   |     meet their full monthly       |
|                                   |     points target and minimum job |
|                                   |     search requirements. Neither  |
|                                   |     the points target nor minimum |
|                                   |     job search requirement are    |
|                                   |     pro-rated for periods where a |
|                                   |     50% or 100% penalty have been |
|                                   |     applied                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system automatically removes  |
|                                   | subsequent mutual obligation      |
|                                   | failures with an event date in an |
|                                   | instalment period in which a      |
|                                   | second penalty has been applied.  |

| 2                                 | Alyce's third penalty for a       |
|                                   | mutual obligation failure is      |
|                                   | revoked + Read more ...           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alyce has committed 3 mutual      |
|                                   | obligation failures. Alyce's      |
|                                   | first, second and third penalty   |
|                                   | form a failure group. Alyce's     |
|                                   | payment was cancelled when the    |
|                                   | third penalty was applied.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Alyce applied for a formal review |
|                                   | of decision of the third          |
|                                   | financial penalty within 13       |
|                                   | weeks. This decision was set      |
|                                   | aside by the Authorised Review    |
|                                   | Officer (ARO). The failure is     |
|                                   | revoked and Alyce's payment is    |
|                                   | restored from the date of effect  |
|                                   | of the non-compliance             |
|                                   | cancellation.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system will, however,         |
|                                   | continue to maintain the 3        |
|                                   | penalties as a failure group.     |
|                                   | This means that if a subsequent   |
|                                   | financial penalty is applied, it  |
|                                   | will form a new failure group.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The grouping of penalties ensures |
|                                   | that where an outcome of a        |
|                                   | decision being reviewed is        |
|                                   | favourable, job seekers will not  |
|                                   | be adversely affected by rippling |
|                                   | changes to penalties triggering   |
|                                   | retrospective payment             |
|                                   | cancellation.                     |
