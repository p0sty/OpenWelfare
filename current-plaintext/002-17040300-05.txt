Historical information

For claims with a start date before 11 June 2020

-   Claims with a start date before 11 June 2020 were assessed under the
    FHA 2 tier assets test
-   If the customer was ineligible for payment under the Tier 1/Tier 2
    assets test, but was eligible for payment under the single FHA
    assets test, payment was granted from 11 June 2020
-   Non-farm assets exempted under the Non-farm Assets Amendment Rule
    2016 was not coded in this task
-   Due to the limitation of only one current line able to be coded in
    the Farm Assets Determination task, where Tier 1 and Tier 2 assets
    are owned by the customer at different percentages, an adjusted
    percentage was determined and coded. For example, if Tier 1 assets
    are 100% owned by the customer and Tier 2 assets are 100% owned by
    the partner, the task with the total Tier 1 and Tier 2 values and
    the ownership split 50/50 was coded
