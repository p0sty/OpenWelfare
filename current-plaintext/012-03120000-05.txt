The evidence of identity (EOI) supplied by organisations and providers
when applying for a Healthcare Identifier (HI) determines what type of
PKI certificate is issued.

Tier 3 reference list for generating PKI certificate policies for the HI Service

This table describes for Tier 3 Service Officers which EOI ratings
generate which PKI certificate policies according to the role of the PKI
applicant. NASH individual PKI certificates are no longer available, but
existing ones can still be used until they expire.
