This document outlines the use of codes for cancellation, rejection and
not effective decisions for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional
Child Care Subsidy (ACCS).

CCS and ACCS cannot be restored

-   There is no restoration function
-   If CCS/ACCS has been cancelled, rejected or made not effective,
    customers can lodge a new claim

Note: exceptions apply. Staff can process an Assisted Customer Claim
(ACC) on the customer’s behalf, without the customer having to submit a
new claim, or contacting the agency to make a claim. For example:

-   a multiple CRN fix, or
-   an incorrect immunisation cancellation

See Immunisation requirements for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and
Processing Child Care Subsidy (CCS) claims for more details.

Cancellation, rejection and not effective codes

Specific codes are used to record a decision to cancel, reject or assess
a claim as not effective for the following payments:

-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) Grandparent
-   Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) Temporary Financial Hardship
    (TFH)
-   Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) Transition to Work (TTW)

Note: Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) Child Wellbeing assessment
outcomes differ from those above. See Processing Additional Child Care
Subsidy (ACCS) (Child Wellbeing) applications.

The Process page contains a list of cancellation, rejection and not
effective reasons for these payments.
