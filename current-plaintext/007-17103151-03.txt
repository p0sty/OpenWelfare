|                                   | setting up a business. A customer |
|                                   | undertaking this activity may     |
|                                   | have them assessed as training    |
|                                   | (for that component of the        |
|                                   | course), followed by an           |
|                                   | assessment for work (setting up a |
|                                   | business). In this case, once the |
|                                   | training component was completed, |
|                                   | or the time limit exhausted, the  |

|                                   | has a higher time limit than work |
