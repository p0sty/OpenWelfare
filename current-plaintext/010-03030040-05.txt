Schools with limited programs

These schools cannot offer a full program at the year or grade in which
the student is qualified to enrol for AIC. A student may be approved to
bypass that school and attend another institution offering an
appropriate program. The student needs to be isolated from other state
schools at which the student is qualified to enrol.
