|                                   | Scanners must be cleaned          |
|                                   | regularly. This cleaning needs:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   wiping over the imaging       |
|                                   |     guides, sensors and rollers   |
|                                   | -   vacuuming the scanner to get  |
|                                   |     rid of dust that can fall     |
|                                   |     onto the mirrors inside the   |
|                                   |     machines                      |
|                                   | -   using he Cleaning Transfer    |
|                                   |     sheets to pick up any         |
|                                   |     leftover dust/loose dirt      |

|                                   | -   Wipe over guide with a dry    |
|                                   |     cloth. Look at the guides,    |
|                                   |     check for sticky material or  |
|                                   |     scratches that can create     |
|                                   |     lines                         |
|                                   | -   If sticky material on the     |
|                                   |     guide, use a wet wipe to      |
|                                   |     clean the guide. Allow to dry |
|                                   |     for a few seconds and then    |
|                                   |     buff clear with the dry       |
|                                   |     cloth. This reduces water     |
|                                   |     marks on the guide            |
|                                   | -   If deep scratch(s) on the     |
|                                   |     guide, check with Team Leader |
|                                   |     as the guide may need         |
|                                   |     replacement                   |

|                                   | Sensors - these are all through   |

|                                   | -   1 square sensor at the bottom |
|                                   |     of the feeding tray           |
|                                   | -   on the top and bottom of the  |
|                                   |     scanner near the rollers      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Vacuum all sensors to clear any   |
|                                   | build up dust. Vacuuming will     |
|                                   | remove the dust from out of the   |
|                                   | machine better than using a cloth |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Rollers - these are all       |
|                                   |     through the machine at the    |
|                                   |     top and bottom.               |
|                                   | -   Grey rollers - these grip the |
|                                   |     paper to feed through the     |
|                                   |     machine. If the rollers are   |
|                                   |     skipping, it could be due to  |
|                                   |     a bald spot on the roller or  |
|                                   |     the roller is worn out and    |
|                                   |     has no grip left. These can   |
|                                   |     be replaced - if replacing    |
|                                   |     the rollers; the powder must  |
|                                   |     be wiped off the roller       |
|                                   |     before fitting                |
|                                   | -   Orange rollers - these grip   |
|                                   |     the paper when it is inside   |
|                                   |     the machine. If the paper is  |
|                                   |     jamming or not feeding        |
|                                   |     correctly in the scanner, it  |
|                                   |     could be due to dust on the   |
|                                   |     roller or again a bald spot   |
|                                   |     on the roller. These cannot   |
|                                   |     be replaced by Services       |
|                                   |     Australia and need a          |
|                                   |     technician to attend the      |
|                                   |     site. Clean the rollers and   |
|                                   |     check for worn parts          |
