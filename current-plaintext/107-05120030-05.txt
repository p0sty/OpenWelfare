+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Age qualification                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Davdar is a young refugee     |
|                                   |     from Afghanistan              |
|                                   | -   Davdar was paid Youth         |
|                                   |     Allowance (YA) because his    |
|                                   |     visa stated he was 16 years   |
|                                   |     of age                        |
|                                   | -   Davdar did not know his exact |
|                                   |     age as he had led a tribal    |
|                                   |     existence before coming to    |
|                                   |     Australia                     |
|                                   | -   After getting actual birth    |
|                                   |     records, Davdar was only 14.  |
|                                   |     This means Davdar did not     |
|                                   |     qualify for YA                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Even though Davdar did not        |
|                                   | knowingly provide incorrect       |
|                                   | information or fail to comply     |
|                                   | with legislation, he did not      |
|                                   | qualify for YA. The full amount   |
|                                   | of YA paid to Davdar is a debt.   |
|                                   | Entitlement to another payment    |
|                                   | (known as notional entitlement),  |
|                                   | for example, Special Benefit      |
|                                   | (SpB) cannot be decided after the |
|                                   | fact (retrospectively). This      |
|                                   | means no equivalent amount of     |
|                                   | another payment can be used to    |
|                                   | offset the debt. In this case,    |
|                                   | recovering the debt would be      |
|                                   | unfair and unjust.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this example, special          |
|                                   | circumstances exist that justify  |
|                                   | waiving recovery.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Social Security Payments          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | No debt due to age qualification  |
|                                   | can be raised before the          |
|                                   | determination date when:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   there are no actual birth     |
|                                   |     records, and                  |
|                                   | -   an estimated Date of Birth    |
|                                   |     gets updated with what is     |
|                                   |     thought to be a more accurate |
|                                   |     estimate. For example through |
|                                   |     bone density testing          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the date of       |
|                                   | effect of the new decision would  |
|                                   | be under s118(13) of the Social   |
|                                   | Security Administration Act. This |
|                                   | legislation states, in part, the  |
|                                   | date of effect is the date of     |
|                                   | determination.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Family Assistance payments        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is a recoverable debt due to |
|                                   | age qualification. This is        |
|                                   | because the Family Assistance     |
|                                   | date of effect is the date of     |
|                                   | event for all non income related  |
|                                   | changes (s31 FA (Admin) Act).     |
|                                   | Consider a waiver under the       |
|                                   | special circumstances provisions  |
|                                   | for this example.                 |

| 2                                 | Waiver of compensation affected   |
|                                   | payments (CAP) made during a      |

|                                   | Consider waving a debt if:        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the debt is a result of a     |
|                                   |     compensation preclusion       |
|                                   |     period, and                   |
|                                   | -   the customer is subject to a  |
|                                   |     non-payment period under the  |
|                                   |     Victorian Transport Accident  |
|                                   |     Act 1986                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The definition of an 'earner'     |
|                                   | under the Victorian Transport     |
|                                   | Accident Act 1986, excludes some  |
|                                   | Centrelink customers from         |
|                                   | receiving compensation for the    |
|                                   | first 18 months, following their  |
|                                   | injury. If compensation is not    |
|                                   | paid for the above reason, the    |
|                                   | date of the accident/injury is    |
|                                   | still the date that the loss of   |
|                                   | earnings or loss of earning       |
|                                   | capacity begins. This means that  |
|                                   | this is the start date of the     |
|                                   | preclusion period under section   |
|                                   | 1165 of the Social Security Act   |
|                                   | 1991.                             |

|                                   | There is no 'double dipping' in   |
|                                   | the above circumstance. It would  |
|                                   | be inequitable in these           |
|                                   | circumstances to recover the part |
|                                   | of the debt representing CAPs     |
|                                   | paid during the Victorian         |

|                                   | arrangement is waived.            |

|                                   | delegate must decide if it meets  |
