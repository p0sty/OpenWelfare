This document outlines information and phone enquiry details for each
Written Authority Required medicine.

Written authority approval required

Some medicines used to treat chronic conditions require written
authority approval from Services Australia before they can be subsidised
under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

Due to the clinical use or other special features of these medicines,
applications for authority approval must be made in writing.

The medicine is not PBS-subsidised without authority approval, and
retrospective approval (often known as an 'owing' script) is not
allowable under the PBS.

Complex Drugs Programs portal

A team portal is available to agency staff trained in delivering
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Complex Drugs program services.

The portal provides easy access to commonly used sources, including
databases and letters.

To access the portal, go to the specialised drugs drive, open the
'portal folder' and select 'portal start up'.

Clean up reports

Clean up reports are required to be actioned before the end of each
calendar month for accuracy in statistical reporting.

The Resources page contains the Services Australia website and
information on each written Authority required drug administered by
Services Australia.
