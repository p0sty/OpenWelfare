This document outlines how a change of course of study will affect an
ABSTUDY student's payment and how to process the necessary changes.

Study requirements

ABSTUDY or ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) students need to
be studying an approved course and:

-   studying full-time
-   approved for a concessional study load, or
-   qualified for ABSTUDY under the Part-time Award

Change of course

If a student tells Services Australia they are changing courses, find
out if:

-   the new course and institution are approved
-   they are still within their reasonable time, and
-   they have not exceeded limits of assistance

If the student is changing to an unapproved course or institution, they
will only be eligible for ABSTUDY if they are undertaking an approved
Indigenous special course.

Note: if an ABSTUDY student or Australian Apprentice discontinues and
then subsequently starts to receive Living Allowance again, in either
the same course/apprenticeship or a different course/apprenticeship,
they remain entitled to ABSTUDY Living Allowance if the period between
is no greater than 28 days.

Online accounts

[] Students registered online can view their personal information
including study details by selecting My Details > Personal and contact
details > Manage study details menu option on their Centrelink online
account or on their mobile device using the Express Plus applications.

Students may notify the change to their study details by updating their
details online if the student provides a change to their study details,
the record may generate a DOC with details of the change for follow up
action to be undertaken by a Service Officer.

Grandfathered ABSTUDY PES

Students who receive ABSTUDY PES and transferred to JobSeeker Payment
(JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA), will stop being eligible for ABSTUDY PES
if they defer or withdraw before the end of their course if they:

-   are in the Disability Support Pension (DSP) transition group and
    assessed as having a partial capacity to work, or
-   stopped receiving Parenting Payment Single (PPS) due to their
    youngest child turning 14 years of age

If they subsequently resume the same course, they are still not eligible
for ABSTUDY PES except for ABSTUDY PES students who resume the same
course within 28 days.

Changing details of the course including Student Start or Student End
date on the following screens can also affect entitlement for Relocation
