This document outlines how to change the debt after being paid lump sum
compensation.

Special circumstances

When special circumstances exist, section 1184K allows the Compensation
Recovery Team (CRT) to treat all or part of a compensation payment as:

-   not having been made or
-   not liable to be paid

Recalculate the lump sum preclusion period and any debt.

Disregarded compensation

The CRT decides how much compensation is to be disregarded.

For consent settlements the new compensation part will be half of the
reduced lump sum amount.

For adjudicated awards consider how much economic loss will need to be
taken into account.

Code the amended economic loss value on the Compensation Management
System (CMS) once determined. The system then recalculates the debt on
the customer's social security pension or social security benefit.

Account (SF030).
