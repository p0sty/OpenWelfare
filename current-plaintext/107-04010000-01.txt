This document outlines a number of procedures for raising Centrelink
debts that are common to all payment types.

Raising Centrelink debts

Staff should:

-   raise a recoverable debt as quickly as possible
-   inform the customer of the debt as soon as it happens
-   process debts correctly to avoid Manual Follow-up (MFU) activities

Access requirements to action debt activities

Debt Staff have the required system access to perform debt related
functions, such as running the Debt Script.

Non-Debt Staff required to perform a debt related action need the
appropriate security access. See the Resources page for details.

After hours debt calls to customers

Outbound customer contact may occur outside of Monday to Friday 8:00am
to 5:00pm. Permitted outbound contact hours are Monday to Friday 8:00am
to 8:00pm local time where the customer lives.

If a customer asks why they are being contacted after hours, staff
should explain that they have tried to find the best time to discuss the
debt with the customer.

Debt Staff are to record all customer contacts on a DOC.

Customer service delivery staff

If a customer asks about an after hours call:

-   read the Customer Overview screen
-   confirm if the contact was legitimate

Process Direct

See Raising Child Care Subsidy (CCS) debts in Process Direct.

Customer record updates not generating debt shells

If a user makes an update that should be generating a debt shell, but
the system does not create one, see Create a new debt record manually on
the Debt Management and Information System (DMIS).

The Resources page contains information about tax adjustment and common
tax adjustment errors.
