|                                   | semester subjects. Jack has not   |
|                                   | met the minimum pass requirements |
|                                   | to continue the course.           |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | would need to update Jack's       |
|                                   | activities to determine whether   |
|                                   | Jack will remain eligible for     |

|                                   | semester subjects. Jill meets     |
|                                   | with the course provider and      |
|                                   | discusses options for semester    |
|                                   | two. Jill is advised that Jill    |

|                                   | continue to study in semester     |
|                                   | two, if Jill also participates in |

|                                   | participate in the course. At the |
|                                   | end of semester two, Jill has     |
|                                   | passed three of the four subjects |
|                                   | and is able to provide proof of   |

|                                   |     provider - this was provided  |
|                                   |     to Jill at the end of         |
|                                   |     semester one. It confirms the |
|                                   |     course provider's support for |
|                                   |     Jill's continued study which  |
|                                   |     was dependent on enrolment in |
|                                   |     the study support program.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jill continues to be eligible for |
|                                   | ACCS (Transition to Work).        |

Job Plan example

Julie has an employment contract, and an active Job Plan, for nine
months. After receiving ACCS (Transition to Work) for a work activity
for 26 weeks (six months), Julie applies for ACCS (Transition to Work)
for a study activity for 52 weeks.

Julie is required to provide evidence of the study activity, but as
Julie is continuing to work while studying and the Job Plan remains
active, no updates are required to the Job Plan. Julie will have to
update the Job Plan within the next three months before the employment
contract ends or the Job Plan will become inactive.

If the Job Plan expires while Julie is receiving ACCS (Transition to
Work), the ACCS will automatically cancel if a new Job Plan is not
negotiated before the start of Julie's next CCS fortnight.
