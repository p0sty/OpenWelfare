This document outlines how job seeker or participant reclaims payment
after a Targeted Compliance Framework cancellation.

Non-compliance cancellations

The Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) is used by Employment Services
providers to encourage job seekers to meet their mutual obligation
requirements.

A TCF non-compliance cancellation occurs when a job seeker:

-   fails to accept or commence suitable work
-   voluntarily leaves suitable work without reasonable excuse while in
    receipt of participation payment
-   is dismissed due to misconduct as a worker from suitable employment
    while in receipt of a participation payment, or
-   incurs a third financial penalty for persistently committing mutual
    obligation failures

When payment is cancelled, the job seeker enters a post cancellation
non-payment period of 4 weeks, or 6 weeks when an unemployment failure
related to a relocation job has been committed. Cancellation of payment
for these reasons will require the job seeker to re-claim payment.

Job seekers can reclaim payment at any stage during or following the
post cancellation non-payment period. The job seeker will generally be
subject to RapidConnect. The start date of a return to payment may be
affected by the post cancellation non-payment period end date.

Where a job seeker returns to payment following a post cancellation
non-payment period, the Job Plan that was in place prior to the
cancellation will remain in force until another Job Plan is created.

Failing to meet re-engagement requirements

Participation payments are cancelled if the job seeker fails to comply
with re-engagement requirements, issued by an employment services
provider. This includes job seekers who are required to contact Services
Australia to arrange a Capability Assessment. Job seekers issued with a
re-engagement requirement must do so within 29 days or payment will
cancel.

When a job seeker's payment is cancelled 'Customer failed to re-engage
(CDR)', they will generally need to reclaim. Further information is
available within Re-engaging job seekers – Targeted Compliance
Framework.

Job seeker's compliance zone when payment recommences

When a job seeker's participation payment re-commences, the Employment
Services System (ESS) will identify which TCF compliance zone the job
seeker will return to. They will generally return to the zone they were
in prior to the cancellation.

Job seekers, who reclaim payment immediately after a cancellation for
persistent non-compliance, will return to the penalty zone. When this
occurs, a new failure group commences, this means if a further mutual
obligation failure is applied a 50% payment reduction occurs, a second
mutual obligation failure will reduce payment by 100% and so on.

However, job seekers will return to the green zone when they were in
the:

-   financial penalty zone and their payment has been cancelled for 3
    active months or more, or
-   warning zone and their payment has been cancelled for 6 active
    months or more

Outstanding Capability Interview or Capability Assessment

When a Capability Interview or Capability Assessment was triggered but
not completed prior to cancellation, the Employment Services System
(ESS) will determine if the assessment is still required.

When a Capability Assessment is retriggered, the job seeker should be
referred to the Participation Solutions Team (PST) to have the
Capability Assessment conducted. The job seeker will not be able to
report until the Capability Assessment is completed.
