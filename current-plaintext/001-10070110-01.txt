This document outlines the processes that apply when a job seeker does
not meet their monthly points target or job search requirement. A
ParentsNext provider cannot report this type of non-compliance event.

Monthly points target and job search requirements

Job seekers who are receiving a participation payment are required to
actively seek and be willing to accept any offers of suitable work.

For job seekers with mutual obligation requirements, the Job Plan will
record what the job seeker must do to satisfy those requirements under
social security law.

The monthly points target only applies to job seekers who have a
Workforce Australia provider, including Workforce Australia Online.

Where appropriate, Community Development Program (CDP) and Disability
Employment Services (DES) Job Plans include a requirement to undertake
and report a specified number of job searches each month.

Workforce Australia job seekers - Requirement to meet a monthly points target

Workforce Australia Job Plans include a Points Based Activation System
(PBAS) requirement, which requires job seekers to meet a specified
monthly points target and, in most cases the point target includes, a
minimum job search requirement. The monthly points target and minimum
job search requirement is set by the provider, based on a participant's
individual circumstances and local labour market.

The job seeker's Job Plan will specify that the job seeker must meet
their monthly points target. It will not include the number of points
the job seeker is required to get or the number of job search efforts
required. The points target can be achieved through a variety of
work-related activities. By default, a job seeker's standard points
target is set at 100 points. Only Providers or the Digital Services
Contact Centre (DSCC) can tailor the points target, in consultation with
the job seeker.

Note: it will not be possible for job seekers with a minimum job search
requirement to meet their points target if they do not meet their
minimum job search requirements for the same points period.

CDP and DES participants - Compulsory job search requirements

Community Development Program (CDP) and Disability Employment Services
(DES) Job Plans cannot contain a requirement to meet a monthly points
target. Where appropriate, CDP and DES Job Plans include a requirement
to undertake and report a specified number of job searches each month.
The inclusion of job search requirements in a CDP Job Plan is dependent
on the strength of the local labour market.

A compulsory job search requirement includes the:

-   number of job searches that must be undertaken each month, and
-   the date each month the job seeker is required to provide evidence
    they have met this requirement

When setting the number of compulsory job searches the job seeker is
required to do per month, the provider considers:

-   social security law
-   guidelines provided by the Department of Employment and Workplace
    Relations
-   the job seeker's circumstances and assessed capacity, and
-   the strength of the local labour market (this is particularly
    relevant in CDP regions)

For job seekers with Workforce Australia, including Workforce Australia
Online, their minimum job search requirement displays on their Workforce
Australia homepage. They must record their job search efforts in the
Workforce Australia online account. They cannot meet their monthly
points target unless they also meet their minimum job search for the
same period.

For all other job seekers, their provider is responsible for notifying
them how and when they are to report their job search efforts to them.
Job seekers are required to provide evidence they have met their job
search requirement to their provider by the due date. If the date falls
on a weekend or public holiday, job seekers will have until close of
business the following working day.

Acting on a job referral or opportunity

All job seekers are required to act on a job referral or job
opportunity.

Their provider notifies specific job referrals or opportunities the job
seeker is required to act on. Notification includes the timeframe in
which the job seeker is required to act on the specific job referral or
opportunity.

If a job seeker is having difficulties following up a specific job
referral or opportunity the provider has notified, they must contact
their provider to discuss this as soon as possible.

Managing non-compliance with a monthly points target or job search requirement - Targeted Compliance Framework

Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, a mutual obligation failure has
been committed when:

-   a job seeker fails to meet their monthly points target (Workforce
    Australia job seekers)
-   job search efforts are unsatisfactory (Disability Employment
    Services (DES) job seekers)
-   the job seeker fails to act on a job referral or opportunity
    (Workforce Australia and DES job seekers)

Job seekers in the green or warning zone, will accrue the following
demerits if the provider is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid
reason:

-   one demerit for failing to meet a monthly points target (Workforce
    Australia job seekers)
-   one demerit for unsatisfactory job search (DES job seekers)
-   failing to satisfactorily act on a job referral or job opportunity
    will fast track the job seeker to the next assessment point
    (Capability Interview or Capability Assessment), regardless of the
    number of demerits they have accrued

If a job seeker is in the penalty zone, and their provider is not
satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason, the provider will generate
the following mutual obligation failure investigations:

-   Failure to comply with other requirement - for Workforce Australia
    job seekers who do not meet their points target.
    Note: the provider report will specify that the failure is for not
    meeting the monthly points target
-   Did not act on job referral - for Workforce Australia and DES job
    seekers who fail to act on a job referral
-   Failure to meet job search requirement - for DES job seekers who do
    not meet their job search requirement

A Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer will
investigate the compliance action and a failure will be applied if the
job seeker does not provide a reasonable excuse or misconduct has
occurred.

Consideration must be given to what constitutes a 'reasonable excuse'
where the failure covers a longer period, such as a failure for not
meeting their monthly points target or not meeting job search
requirements.

Examples of a reasonable excuse that may be applicable for extended
durations include, but are not limited to:

-   local natural disaster
-   bereavement
-   family or caring responsibilities
-   homelessness or unstable accommodation

See Mutual obligation failures under the Targeted Compliance Framework
for more information.

Managing non-compliance with a job search requirement - Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework, a Community Development
Program (CDP) provider may choose to manage failure to meet job search
by submitting a Participation Report to Services Australia.

On receipt of the Participation Report:

-   a connection failure will be generated, and
-   the CDP participant will be sent a notification advising them to
    contact the Participation Solutions Team (PST) as soon as possible
    to discuss the non-compliance event

A PST-skilled Service Officer will investigate the compliance action and
if the CDP participant does not provide a reasonable excuse for failing
to provide suitable job search efforts, a connection failure will be
applied.

Consideration must be given to what constitutes a 'reasonable excuse'
where the failure covers a longer period, such as a failure for not
meeting their job search requirements.

Examples of a reasonable excuse that may be applicable for extended
durations include, but are not limited to:

-   local natural disaster
-   bereavement
-   family or caring responsibilities
-   homelessness or unstable accommodation

See Investigating a connection failure for more information.
