|                                   | Samantha was eligible for FTB     |
|                                   | because of meeting the Australian |

|                                   | claimant because James was born   |
|                                   | before 1 July 2016 and Samantha   |
|                                   | was living on Norfolk Island at   |
|                                   | the time of birth. Samantha was   |

|                                   | On 5 October 2016, Samantha and   |
|                                   | partner Gill died in a car        |
|                                   | accident. James was immediately   |
|                                   | entrusted to the care of          |
|                                   | Samantha's sister Jane, who has   |
|                                   | always lived on Norfolk Island    |
|                                   | and is an Australian citizen. On  |
|                                   | 1 November 2016, Jane lodged a    |
|                                   | claim for PPL for James. Although |
|                                   | James was born before 1 July      |
|                                   | 2016, Jane is residentially       |
|                                   | qualified for PPL because James   |
|                                   | was entrusted to Jane's care in   |
|                                   | exceptional circumstances after 1 |

|                                   | Mira has lived in Australia since |

|                                   | Provisional Visa (PPV). On 3rd    |
|                                   | August 2016, Mira gave birth to   |
|                                   | child Isaac and claimed FTB and   |
|                                   | PPL on 1 September 2016. Both     |
|                                   | claims are granted and Mira       |
|                                   | elects to be paid PPL from the    |
|                                   | date of claim.                    |

|                                   | In October 2016 Mira, Mira's      |
|                                   | partner and Isaac travelled       |
|                                   | outside Australia for a 2 week    |
|                                   | holiday to visit Mira's country   |
|                                   | of birth and introduce Isaac to   |
|                                   | extended family. As Mira was on a |
|                                   | PPV at the time of departure, PPL |
|                                   | and FTB are only portable if the  |
|                                   | reason for travel is approved.    |
|                                   | Travel for holiday purposes is    |
|                                   | not an approved reason for        |
|                                   | travel; Mira was not entitled to  |
|                                   | PPL or FTB while outside          |
|                                   | Australia.                        |

|                                   | The system reinstated FTB on      |
|                                   | return to Australia, however as   |
|                                   | the qualifying residence rules    |
|                                   | for PPL are that primary          |
|                                   | claimants must qualify for each   |
|                                   | day starting from the date of     |
|                                   | birth of the child until the end  |
|                                   | of the PPL entitlement period,    |
|                                   | Mira lost qualification for PPL   |
|                                   | from the date of departure from   |
|                                   | Australia.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On the date Mira departed         |
|                                   | Australia, PPL entitlement was    |
|                                   | automatically cancelled 'NRQ'     |
|                                   | (Not Residentially Qualified).    |
|                                   | Any PPL payments issued from the  |
|                                   | date of Mira's departure must be  |
|                                   | raised as an overpayment. Mira    |
|                                   | was not able to re-claim PPL for  |
|                                   | Isaac on return to Australia.     |

|                                   | Marco proposes. The couple are    |
|                                   | married the next day in front of  |
|                                   | friends and family, including     |
|                                   | Kellie's 3 year old child Timmy,  |

|                                   | Marco adopted Timmy, Marco has an |

|                                   | able to claim PPL. The PPL start  |
|                                   | date selected is 24 December      |

|                                   | eligible for CP or CA. However    |
|                                   | this does not impact the          |

|                                   | because the PPL period had        |
|                                   | started, and Marco is therefore   |
|                                   | able to receive it for the full   |
|                                   | 18 week PPL period.               |

|                                   | PPL would only be impacted if     |
|                                   | Marco had not been eligible to    |
|                                   | receive CA and CP originally,     |
|                                   | such as a subsequent review being |
|                                   | conducted that found Kellie was   |
|                                   | never a valid care receiver.      |
