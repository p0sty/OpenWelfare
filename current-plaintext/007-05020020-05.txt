|                                   | Mira lost qualification for PPL   |
|                                   | from the date of departure from   |

|                                   | raised as an overpayment. Mira    |
|                                   | was not able to re-claim PPL for  |
|                                   | Isaac on return to Australia.     |

|                                   | adopted Timmy, Marco has an       |

|                                   | able to claim PPL. The PPL start  |
|                                   | date selected is 24 December      |
|                                   | 2019.                             |

|                                   | this does not impact the          |
|                                   | exemption from the NARWP for PPL  |
|                                   | because the PPL period had        |
|                                   | started, and Marco is therefore   |
|                                   | able to receive it for the full   |
|                                   | 18 week PPL period.               |

|                                   | PPL would only be impacted if     |
|                                   | Marco had not been eligible to    |
|                                   | receive CA and CP originally,     |
|                                   | such as a subsequent review being |
|                                   | conducted that found Kellie was   |
|                                   | never a valid care receiver.      |

|                                   | critically ill friend Alison. The |
|                                   | subclass 116 visa provides an     |
|                                   | automatic exemption for Allen     |
|                                   | from the NARWP for Carer Payment  |
|                                   | (CP) and Carer Allowance (CA).    |

|                                   | On 19 December 2023, Alison is    |
|                                   | given just weeks to live and      |
|                                   | Allen adopts Alison's 3 year old  |
|                                   | child Trevor.                     |

|                                   | Because Allen is in receipt of an |
|                                   | income support payment (ISP),     |
|                                   | when Trevor was adopted, Allen    |
|                                   | has an exemption from the NARWP   |
|                                   | and is able to claim PPL. Allen   |
|                                   | claims a continuous block of 20   |
|                                   | consecutive weekdays with the     |
|                                   | first PPL day nominated being 18  |
|                                   | December 2023.                    |

|                                   | On 15 January 2024, Alison passes |
|                                   | away and Allen is no longer       |
|                                   | eligible for CP or CA. Because    |
|                                   | Allen is receiving an ISP the day |
|                                   | before a continuous block of PPL  |
|                                   | days of at least 10 consecutive   |
|                                   | weekdays, Allen is exempt from    |
|                                   | the NARWP for the whole period,   |
|                                   | including weekend days in that    |
|                                   | period.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | PPL would only be impacted if     |
|                                   | Allen had not been eligible to    |
|                                   | receive CA and CP originally,     |
|                                   | such as a subsequent review being |
|                                   | conducted that found Alison was   |
|                                   | never a valid care receiver.      |
