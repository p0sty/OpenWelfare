| Item                              | Example                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | -   M and F are assessed for the  |
|                                   |     costs of the child A, who is  |
|                                   |     in the shared care of M and F |
|                                   | -   M notified Child Support on   |
|                                   |     13 August that the care of A  |
|                                   |     had changed on 1 August.      |
|                                   |     Child Support made a care     |
|                                   |     percentage decision on 26     |
|                                   |     August, deciding that a       |
|                                   |     change had occurred, that M   |
|                                   |     now had 40% care and F had    |
|                                   |     60% care                      |
|                                   | -   F objected to that decision   |
|                                   |     on 11 December, explaining    |
|                                   |     that they were not able to    |
|                                   |     lodge the objection earlier.  |
|                                   |     Child Support considered the  |
|                                   |     objection and decided on 6    |
|                                   |     February to allow the         |
|                                   |     objection, as M’s care        |
|                                   |     percentage is 36% and F’s     |
|                                   |     care percentage is 64%        |
|                                   | -   Child Support then considered |
|                                   |     if special circumstances      |
|                                   |     prevented F from lodging the  |
|                                   |     objection within 28 days.     |
|                                   |     Child Support is satisfied    |
|                                   |     that special circumstances    |
|                                   |     did exist. Child Support then |
|                                   |     considered if the discretion  |
|                                   |     to extend the period should   |
|                                   |     be exercised. Child Support   |
|                                   |     is satisfied that F did not   |
|                                   |     rest on their rights and that |
|                                   |     M would not be prejudiced by  |
|                                   |     a decision to extend the      |
|                                   |     period in which to lodge the  |
|                                   |     objection. Child Support      |
|                                   |     makes a determination under   |
|                                   |     s87AA(2) that the objection   |
|                                   |     was lodged within time        |
|                                   | -   The assessment is amended     |
|                                   |     from 1 August to use the      |
|                                   |     objection decision            |
|                                   |     percentages (M 36% and F 64%) |
|                                   |     to replace the original care  |
|                                   |     percentage decision           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If special circumstances exist,   |
|                                   | but it is not appropriate to      |
|                                   | extend the lodgement period to    |
|                                   | the date that the objection was   |
|                                   | lodged, do not exercise the       |
|                                   | discretion to extend the          |
|                                   | lodgement period. Process the     |
|                                   | decision as if there are no       |
|                                   | special circumstances.            |

|                                   | determination regarding the date  |
|                                   | of effect under s87AA(2).         |

Table 3: this table describes examples of care terminating events when
an objection is lodged.

|                                   | care change occurs and Kevin now  |
|                                   | has 100% care of Justin. Services |
|                                   | Australia is not notified of the  |
|                                   | change in care until 8 March 2019 |
|                                   | (more than 26 weeks after the     |
|                                   | care change occurred).            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Jodie's care reduces below 35% |
|                                   | care from 1 August 2018 (date of  |
|                                   | event) and Kevin's increase       |
|                                   | percentage of care cannot be used |
|                                   | in the assessment until 8 March   |
|                                   | 2019 (date of notification), a    |
|                                   | terminating event occurs on 1     |
|                                   | August 2018. Neither parent has a |
|                                   | care percentage of 35% or more.   |
|                                   | When Services Australia was       |
|                                   | advised of the change in care on  |
|                                   | 8 March 2019, a new application   |
|                                   | for child support is required if  |
|                                   | either parent wants to restart    |
|                                   | the case.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jodie lodges an objection on 1    |
|                                   | May 2019. The original care       |
|                                   | decision is reviewed and an       |
|                                   | objection decision is made. The   |
|                                   | decision is that from 1 August    |
|                                   | 2018 Jodie has 100% care of       |
|                                   | Justin. The new care              |
|                                   | determination applies from 1 May  |
|                                   | 2019, the date the objection was  |
|                                   | received. As the assessment was   |
|                                   | terminated, Jodie will need to    |
|                                   | make a new application for child  |
|                                   | support.                          |

| Multiple cases                    | An objection decision can have    |
|                                   | varying impacts where there are   |
|                                   | multiple cases. For example, if   |
|                                   | an objection is about an          |
|                                   | estimate, revoking an estimate on |
|                                   | one case would impact other cases |
|                                   | using the same estimate.          |

|                                   | Ensure you review any associated  |
|                                   | cases for potential impacts when  |
