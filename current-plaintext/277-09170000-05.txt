Example of objection lodged outside the 28/90 day timeframe

-   M and F are assessed for the costs of the child A, who is in the
    shared care of M and F
-   M notified Child Support on 13 August that the care of A had changed
    on 1 August. Child Support made a care percentage decision on 26
    August, deciding that a change had occurred, that M now had 40% care
    and F had 60% care
-   F objected to that decision on 11 December, explaining that they
    were not able to lodge the objection earlier. Child Support
    considered the objection and decided on 6 February to allow the
    objection, as M’s care percentage is 36% and F’s care percentage is
    64%
-   Child Support then considered if special circumstances prevented F
    from lodging the objection within 28 days. Child Support is
    satisfied that special circumstances did exist. Child Support then
    considered if the discretion to extend the period should be
    exercised. Child Support is satisfied that F did not rest on their
    rights and that M would not be prejudiced by a decision to extend
    the period in which to lodge the objection. Child Support makes a
    determination under s87AA(2) that the objection was lodged within
    time
-   The assessment is amended from 1 August to use the objection
    decision percentages (M 36% and F 64%) to replace the original care
    percentage decision

If special circumstances exist, but it is not appropriate to extend the
lodgement period to the date that the objection was lodged, do not
exercise the discretion to extend the lodgement period. Process the
decision as if there are no special circumstances. Go to Step 4.

Advise both customers they have appeal rights to the AAT on the
objection decision and on the determination regarding the date of effect
under s87AA(2).

The customer may lodge an application to have the objection decision,
the date of effect or both components of the objection reviewed by AAT.

If further assistance is required to determine whether special
circumstances exist, contact a Service Support Officer (SSO).

Update the special circumstances in the Objection Maintenance window and
record the outcome.

Note: if the applicant has applied for special circumstances and the
date of effect needs to be determined for the objection decision,
consideration of special circumstances must be finalised in time for the
objection to be processed within the legislated timeframes.

| 1                                 | -   M and F are assessed for the  |
|                                   |     costs of the child A, who is  |
|                                   |     in the shared care of M and F |
|                                   | -   M notified Child Support on   |
|                                   |     13 August that the care of A  |
|                                   |     had changed on 1 August.      |
|                                   |     Child Support made a care     |
|                                   |     percentage decision on 26     |
|                                   |     August, deciding that a       |
|                                   |     change had occurred, that M   |
|                                   |     now had 40% care and F had    |
|                                   |     60% care                      |
|                                   | -   F objected to that decision   |
|                                   |     on 11 December, explaining    |
|                                   |     that they were not able to    |
|                                   |     lodge the objection earlier.  |
|                                   |     Child Support considered the  |
|                                   |     objection and decided on 6    |
|                                   |     February to allow the         |
|                                   |     objection, as M’s care        |
|                                   |     percentage is 36% and F’s     |
|                                   |     care percentage is 64%        |
|                                   | -   Child Support then considered |
|                                   |     if special circumstances      |
|                                   |     prevented F from lodging the  |
|                                   |     objection within 28 days.     |
|                                   |     Child Support is satisfied    |
|                                   |     that special circumstances    |
|                                   |     did exist. Child Support then |
|                                   |     considered if the discretion  |
|                                   |     to extend the period should   |
|                                   |     be exercised. Child Support   |
|                                   |     is satisfied that F did not   |
|                                   |     rest on their rights and that |
|                                   |     M would not be prejudiced by  |
|                                   |     a decision to extend the      |
|                                   |     period in which to lodge the  |
|                                   |     objection. Child Support      |
|                                   |     makes a determination under   |
|                                   |     s87AA(2) that the objection   |
|                                   |     was lodged within time        |
|                                   | -   The assessment is amended     |
|                                   |     from 1 August to use the      |
|                                   |     objection decision            |
|                                   |     percentages (M 36% and F 64%) |
|                                   |     to replace the original care  |
|                                   |     percentage decision           |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | but it is not appropriate to      |

|                                   | the date that the objection was   |

|                                   | lodgement period. Process the     |
|                                   | decision as if there are no       |
|                                   | special circumstances. Go to Step |

|                                   | care change occurs and Kevin now  |
|                                   | has 100% care of Justin. Services |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Jodie's care reduces below 35% |
|                                   | care from 1 August 2018 (date of  |

|                                   | terminating event occurs on 1     |
|                                   | August 2018. Neither parent has a |
|                                   | care percentage of 35% or more.   |
|                                   | When Services Australia was       |
|                                   | advised of the change in care on  |
|                                   | 8 March 2019, a new application   |
|                                   | for child support is required if  |
|                                   | either parent wants to restart    |
|                                   | the case.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jodie lodges an objection on 1    |
|                                   | May 2019. The original care       |
|                                   | decision is reviewed and an       |
|                                   | objection decision is made. The   |
|                                   | decision is that from 1 August    |
|                                   | 2018 Jodie has 100% care of       |
|                                   | Justin. The new care              |
|                                   | determination applies from 1 May  |
|                                   | 2019, the date the objection was  |
|                                   | received. As the assessment was   |
|                                   | terminated, Jodie will need to    |
|                                   | make a new application for child  |
|                                   | support.                          |
