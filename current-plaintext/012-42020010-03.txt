Ahpra notifies the agency when an eligible medical practitioner obtains
acupuncture endorsement. The below process commences after the
information from Ahpra has been received through current workflow
arrangements.

Medical practitioners who have been endorsed with acupuncture through
the CMBA must apply to the agency to have the endorsement recorded.

Requests to cease acupuncture endorsement may be received from Ahpra.
