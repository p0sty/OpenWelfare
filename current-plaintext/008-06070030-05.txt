| 1                                 | Question: What happens if an      |
|                                   | Assessor contacts to advise the   |
|                                   | report they have submitted        |
|                                   | requires correction? + Read more  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: An Assessor can reopen a  |
|                                   | JCA report provided the status of |
|                                   | the report is still 'Submitted',  |
|                                   | and is not yet 'Finalised'.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When a report is reopened, the    |
|                                   | Assessor can only access certain  |
|                                   | parts of the report to edit. This |
|                                   | is sufficient for an Assessor to  |
|                                   | action a new referral, and        |
|                                   | protects those tabs that have     |
|                                   | implications on income support,   |
|                                   | participation requirements and    |
|                                   | mutual obligation requirements.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the error is with medical      |
|                                   | information such as work capacity |
|                                   | ratings and impairment ratings,   |
|                                   | the report should be returned     |
|                                   | (rejected) to enable the Assessor |
|                                   | to make these necessary           |
|                                   | amendments.                       |

|                                   | report requires correction and is |
|                                   | already accepted? + Read more ... |

|                                   | Answer: The referring team may    |
|                                   | initially accept a report but     |
|                                   | later decide that it should not   |
|                                   | have been accepted.               |

|                                   | If the report status is still     |
|                                   | 'submitted' and the referring     |
|                                   | team need to return the report to |
|                                   | the Assessor for amendment, an    |
|                                   | online incident reporting form    |
|                                   | needs to be completed. Once this  |
|                                   | has been actioned by the          |
|                                   | Applications Service Desk, the    |
|                                   | referring team should be able to  |
|                                   | return the report.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: this action should only be  |
|                                   | undertaken when the change to     |
|                                   | impairment ratings or work        |
|                                   | capacity is likely to have an     |
|                                   | impact on their participation     |
|                                   | requirements/mutual obligation    |
|                                   | requirements or payment           |
|                                   | eligibility.                      |

|                                   | If the report status is           |
|                                   | 'finalised' and it may affect     |
|                                   | determinations of impairment      |
|                                   | ratings or hours of work          |
|                                   | capacity, the customer will need  |
|                                   | to be re-referred for an ESAt/JCA |
|                                   | as a file assessment.             |

|                                   | The system allows Service         |
|                                   | Officers to override details that |

|                                   | This should generally only occur  |
|                                   | as a result of a Disability       |
|                                   | Medical Assessment (DMA) where    |
|                                   | the original JCA recommendations  |
|                                   | have not been changed, or as a    |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Service Officers can view |
|                                   | reports when they are finalised.  |

| 4                                 | Question: Is it correct that a    |
|                                   | customer cannot be referred for   |
|                                   | another JCA while there is an     |
|                                   | existing report and the status is |
|                                   | not yet 'Finalised'? + Read more  |
|                                   | ...                               |

|                                   | Answer: Yes. A new JCA referral   |
|                                   | cannot be made until the status   |
|                                   | of any previous referral is       |
|                                   | 'finalised'. Early finalisation   |
|                                   | of the previous report may be     |
|                                   | required in some circumstances,   |
|                                   | such as:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   A customer lodges a claim for |

|                                   |     (DSP) immediately after the   |
|                                   |     initial report has been       |
|                                   |     accepted, and a JCA is        |
|                                   |     required to assess the        |
|                                   |     customer's impairment rating  |
|                                   |     as the initial report did not |
|                                   |     indicate a rating             |
|                                   | -   A customer applies for a      |
|                                   |     formal review of a decision   |
|                                   |     and a new JCA is needed       |
|                                   | -   In these circumstances, a     |
|                                   |     staff member with relevant    |
|                                   |     access can request early      |
|                                   |     finalisation of the JCA       |
|                                   |     report, to allow a new JCA    |
|                                   |     referral to proceed           |
