This document outlines the assessment of the away from home rate of
Youth Allowance (YA) for customers where the parental home is isolated.
This criterion only applies to dependent YA customers undertaking
secondary study.

Definition of isolated

Dependent YA secondary students may be eligible for the higher away from
home rate of YA if their parental home is isolated.

The parental home is considered isolated if it is:

-   56 kilometres or more from an appropriate government school, or
-   at least 90 minutes travelling time 1 way, or
-   isolated because of impassable roads for 20 school days in a year

If the family would be eligible for assistance under the Assistance for
Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme, then the away from home rate of YA would
generally be payable to a customer living away from the parental home,
without the provision of reasons.

Students not physically attending classes

Students studying by correspondence, School of the Air etc. cannot be
paid the away from home rate of YA as they do not actually attend
classes. Even if the parental home is isolated, they still have access
to schooling. However, this does not mean that isolated customers should
be denied the away from home rate to attend a school because they could
study by other methods.
