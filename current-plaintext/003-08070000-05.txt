|                                   | SpB is a payment of last resort   |
|                                   | for people who have no others     |
|                                   | means of support. Any property    |
|                                   | holdings should be reviewed       |
|                                   | during SpB reviews.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | During the review, staff can      |
|                                   | investigate why the person is     |
|                                   | holding on to the property, and   |
|                                   | why they are not receiving rental |
|                                   | income, which could alleviate     |
|                                   | their hardship.                   |

|                                   | Generally, a person would only be |
|                                   | granted SpB in this situation if  |
|                                   | they provided evidence            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the property was on the       |
|                                   |     market, but they were unable  |
|                                   |     to sell it, or                |
|                                   | -   there was a legal issue       |
|                                   |     preventing the person from    |
|                                   |     being able to sell the        |
|                                   |     property                      |

|                                   | Family members living in the      |
|                                   | property is not a consideration   |
|                                   | for SpB purposes. SpB is not      |
|                                   | intended to indirectly support    |
|                                   | family members living overseas.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer sold the property |
|                                   | and gave some of the proceeds to  |
|                                   | the family members to help them   |
|                                   | secure accommodation, the gifting |
|                                   | provisions would then affect the  |
|                                   | customer.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | SpB is a discretionary payment.   |
|                                   | So, staff must use discretion in  |
|                                   | assessing qualification,          |
|                                   | payability and the rate of SpB.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the overseas property is       |
|                                   | assessed as an unrealisable asset |
|                                   | when granting SpB, consider at    |
|                                   | the first review if it would be   |
|                                   | realisable.                       |
