This document outlines the action to take when an Income Management
customer asks to commence, cease or vary a regular expense, or a one-off
payment using income managed funds.

Income Management expenses

A customer may contact asking for a change to their Income Management
expenses such as:

-   adding, varying, or cancelling a regular expense to a contracted or
    un-contracted Third Party Organisation (TPO)
-   asking for a one-off payment to a contracted or un-contracted TPO
-   adding, varying, or cancelling a regular BasicsCard expense (for
    BasicsCard Partial Payment method only)
-   transferring a Rent Deduction Scheme or Centrepay deduction to an
    Income Management expense
-   asking for a lump sum payment towards a Services Australia debt
    using income managed funds
-   asking for payment of a personal debt using income managed funds
    (for example, where priority needs have been met by the use of a
    personal credit card)
-   paying for travel for themselves or family members by air, rail, bus
    or another approved method
-   asking for a one-off purchase for a motor vehicle

Requests not covered in this procedure include customers:

-   accessing funds while travelling
-   paying court fines using Income Management funds, or
-   adding or varying Schools Meals Program expenses

Ranking of priority needs

Under Child Protection Income Management (CPIM) and Supporting People at
Risk (SPaR) measures, the referring authority may recommend where income
managed funds should be directed. Social workers who assess a customer
as Vulnerable for the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR) Income
Management can also recommend how income managed funds could be
directed.

Service Officers do not have to comply with the recommendation, but
should document how these needs will be met when conducting an
assessment of reviewing a customer's priority needs.

Reviewing priority needs

When commencing, varying or ending a regular expense, Service Officers
should make sure the customer's priority needs continue to be met. For
more information, see Changes to Income Management priority needs.

Any review of priority needs should include a review of voluntary
deductions (Centrepay and Rent Deduction Scheme payments). This will
identify whether any deductions can be changed to an Income Management
expense, or a duplication of payments.

To do these reviews, staff need to understand how to determine a
customer's priority needs.

Customer changes their EPED

Whenever a customer changes their Entitlement Period End Date (EPED),
staff should update regular expenses to align with the change, as this
does not happen automatically.

Payments from Income Management for a Consumer Lease Agreement

Payments to consumer lease providers can be paid from the Income
Management funds. However, before starting any deductions, tell the
customer about resources available to help them make a decision about
consumer leases and alternatives which include:

-   using the Rent vs buy calculator
-   layby
-   No Interest Loan (NILs)
-   applying for an advance payment (if eligible)
-   a StepUP Loan (low interest loan)

See the Resources page for links.

Income Management and nominees

A payment nominee is responsible for determining allocations from the
Income Management account of the person for whom they are a payment
nominee. A BasicsCard can be issued to the payment nominee, or the
payment nominee can decide to have the card issued to the customer.
Should the payment nominee consent to the card being assigned to the
customer, the customer needs to sign the BasicsCard receipt.

A correspondence nominee cannot be issued with a BasicsCard. A
correspondence nominee can, where there is no payment nominee, generally
act in place of, or on behalf of, the customer in the application of
Income Management.

    agencies that can help customers with consumer rights issues
