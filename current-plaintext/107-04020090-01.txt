This document outlines the circumstances where debts for overpayments of
Telephone Allowance (TAL) should be raised and recovered. It also
explains the different coding that must be used when a customer was the
holder of a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) prior to 20
September 2009 and receiving TAL.

TAL debts

TAL debts will be raised under Subsection 1223(1) of the Social Security
Act. Under this subsection, if a Social Security payment is made to a
customer who, for any reason, was not entitled to that payment is a debt
due to the Commonwealth by the person who obtained the benefit of that
payment.

Cases have occurred where customers have a Commonwealth Seniors Health
Card (CSHC) and are receiving Age Pension. Cancelling the CSHC does not
raise a debt shell for TAL, Seniors Concession Allowance (SCA) or the
One-off payment to older Australians, so they must be raised manually.
Debt Staff must investigate these cases following normal debt raising
procedures.

Note: TAL debts cannot be recovered by withholdings from TAL payments.
TAL debts can however be recovered by withholdings from other payments
that are paid under the Social Security Act and Family Assistance
(Administration) Act 1999.
