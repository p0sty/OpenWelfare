+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Supervisor travel appropriate due |
|                                   | to change of flight               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Nine secondary school students    |
|                                   | are travelling from their         |
|                                   | isolated community to their       |
|                                   | boarding school in the city. The  |
|                                   | only appropriate mode of          |
|                                   | transport is to take the journey  |
|                                   | in 2 legs. The first leg is by    |
|                                   | chartered light aircraft from     |
|                                   | home to a regional airport and    |
|                                   | the second leg from there to the  |
|                                   | city on a regular commercial      |
|                                   | flight. The only light aircraft   |
|                                   | that can use the local airstrip   |
|                                   | can carry no more than 4          |
|                                   | passengers.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   As the journey requires a     |
|                                   |     change of flight, supervision |
|                                   |     of the students would be      |
|                                   |     beneficial. Allowing one      |
|                                   |     supervisor for each 6         |
|                                   |     students, there would         |
|                                   |     normally be 2 supervisors     |
|                                   |     allowed for 9 students. In    |
|                                   |     this case, however, 3         |
|                                   |     supervisors would be required |
|                                   |     as there will be 3 aircraft   |
|                                   |     needed for the initial leg of |
|                                   |     the journey                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The local community can provide 2 |
|                                   | supervisors and the school will   |
|                                   | provide one of their teachers to  |
|                                   | be the other one.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA will cover return travel  |
|                                   |     for the teacher to travel     |
|                                   |     from the school to the        |
|                                   |     community (to meet up with    |
|                                   |     the children) and back again. |
|                                   |     The 2 community supervisors   |
|                                   |     will have their return travel |
|                                   |     from the community to the     |
|                                   |     school authorised             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is not possible to do the      |
|                                   | return journey in one day.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Additional costs associated   |
|                                   |     with travel will be approved  |
|                                   |     (to cover the supervisors'    |

|                                   | kilometres out of Katherine,      |
|                                   | there are 3 children aged between |
|                                   | 12 and 14 who undertake secondary |
|                                   | schooling via the Katherine       |
|                                   | School of the Air. The students   |

|                                   | transport these students to       |
|                                   | Katherine. ABSTUDY has been asked |
|                                   | to approve FAA for a supervisor   |
|                                   | to accompany these young students |
|                                   | on the charter flight.            |

|                                   | -   Given the age of the          |
|                                   |     students, it is desirable     |
|                                   |     that they be supervised on    |
|                                   |     the charter flight. FAA for a |
|                                   |     supervisor to accompany these |

|                                   |     flight to Katherine would be  |
|                                   |     approved. The supervisor may  |
|                                   |     be a parent, a community      |
|                                   |     representative or a           |

|                                   |     Katherine School of the Air.  |
|                                   |     The supervisor is entitled to |
|                                   |     a return journey              |

|                                   | Wongutha Christian Aboriginal     |
|                                   | School is a boarding school near  |
|                                   | Esperance in rural WA. At the end |
|                                   | of each term, many of the         |
|                                   | boarding students are entitled to |
|                                   | FAA for a flight from Esperance   |
|                                   | to Perth. A supervisor would not  |
|                                   | normally be necessary on this     |
|                                   | flight, as the students are       |
|                                   | familiar with this journey.       |
|                                   | However, last term there were     |
|                                   | some problems with the students'  |
|                                   | behaviour on the flight. For this |
|                                   | reason, Wongutha has requested    |
|                                   | that a supervisor from the school |
|                                   | travel with the students.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Due to the students' recent   |
|                                   |     behavioural problems while    |
|                                   |     undertaking this travel, it   |
|                                   |     is desirable that a           |
|                                   |     supervisor accompany the      |
|                                   |     students on the flight from   |
|                                   |     Esperance to Perth. A return  |
|                                   |     journey for a supervisor is   |
|                                   |     approved                      |

|                                   | Jody is attending Djarragun       |
|                                   | College in Cairns and has         |
|                                   | returned home to Aurukun for the  |
|                                   | vacation period. Jody has         |
|                                   | requested FAA to return to school |
|                                   | at the commencement of term 4.    |
|                                   | Jody has been attending Djarragun |
|                                   | College for the last 3 years and  |
|                                   | is familiar with the journey, so  |
|                                   | a supervisor would not normally   |
|                                   | be necessary. However, Jody has   |
|                                   | missed travel on 2 prior          |
|                                   | occasions this year without valid |
|                                   | reason.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Due to Jody's frequently      |
|                                   |     missed travel this year, a    |
|                                   |     supervisor is mandatory to    |
|                                   |     undertake further travel for  |
|                                   |     the remainder of the academic |
|                                   |     year. FAA would not be        |
|                                   |     authorised and booked in      |
|                                   |     advance until a supervisor is |

|                                   | decides to quit work and move the |
|                                   | whole family to Perth to support  |
|                                   | Peta's studies. Peta's partner    |

|                                   | course and find suitable          |

|                                   | Hedland for another 4 weeks and   |
|                                   | then seek FAA to assist them to   |

|                                   |     (LIC) and it is reasonable    |
|                                   |     that they travel to join Peta |
|                                   |     4 weeks later so that Peta's  |
|                                   |     partner could finish work,    |

|                                   |     for vacation travel. Even     |
|                                   |     though Peta is undertaking a  |

|                                   |     forfeited. This is because    |
|                                   |     there is no need for the      |
|                                   |     family to return home in      |
|                                   |     order to reunite the family   |
