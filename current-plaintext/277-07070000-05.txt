|                                   | assessment is registered with     |
|                                   | Child Support and the initial     |

|                                   | made later, can that parent's     |
|                                   | estimate be backdated to the date |
|                                   | of lodgement of the               |

|                                   | Answer: No, an estimate can only  |
|                                   | commence on the day that the      |
|                                   | person makes the election or the  |
|                                   | start or the new child support    |
|                                   | period whichever is the later. It |
|                                   | cannot be backdated to the date   |
|                                   | of lodgement of the initial       |
|                                   | registration application. If      |
|                                   | there are special circumstances   |
|                                   | in the case and the liable parent |
|                                   | has been significantly            |
|                                   | disadvantaged, it may be          |

| 2                                 | Question: If an estimate is in    |
|                                   | place and the payee advises that  |
|                                   | the payer's income circumstances  |
|                                   | have changed, can Child Support   |
|                                   | do anything? + Read more ...      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Yes. The estimate can be  |
|                                   | reviewed. See Child Support       |
|                                   | estimates review (Pre 1 July      |
|                                   | 2010) for details.                |

| 3                                 | Question: If the parent lodges    |
|                                   | another estimate within the 2     |
|                                   | month period can Child Support    |
|                                   | accept it? + Read more ...        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: No, but their existing    |
|                                   | estimate may be able to be        |
|                                   | reviewed. See Child Support       |
|                                   | estimates review (Pre 1 July      |
|                                   | 2010). Also encourage the parent  |
|                                   | to lodge a new estimate at the    |
|                                   | end of the 2 months.              |

| 4                                 | Question: Can the parent ask that |
|                                   | the estimate take effect from a   |
|                                   | future date? + Read more ...      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Sometimes. An estimate    |
|                                   | will commence from the date of    |
|                                   | the election except where the     |
|                                   | estimate is for a new child       |
|                                   | support period which has not yet  |
|                                   | commenced.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5                                 | Question: What should I do if a   |
|                                   | parent wishes to provide an       |
|                                   | estimate of zero income? + Read   |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: If a parent indicates     |
|                                   | that they wish to lodge a zero    |
|                                   | estimate use questioning to       |
|                                   | ascertain that there is no source |
|                                   | of income at all for the          |
|                                   | remainder of the estimate period. |
|                                   | An estimate can only be refused   |
|                                   | if the actual income over the     |
|                                   | estimate period is likely to be   |
|                                   | higher than the estimated income  |
|                                   | provided by the parent. If there  |
|                                   | are sufficient grounds to believe |
|                                   | that the actual income will be    |
|                                   | higher than the estimated income  |
|                                   | refuse the estimate.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Even if a parent's income is zero |
|                                   | at the time they make an estimate |
|                                   | election this is not sufficient   |
|                                   | reason to accept a nil estimate.  |
|                                   | Further questioning is necessary  |
|                                   | to establish whether the parent   |
|                                   | expects to earn any income before |
|                                   | the end of the child support      |
|                                   | period. For example, if a parent  |
|                                   | is no longer working but expects  |
|                                   | to receive a termination payment  |
|                                   | from their employer or a payment  |
|                                   | from their superannuation fund    |
|                                   | before the end of the child       |
|                                   | support period a nil estimate     |
|                                   | would not be accurate.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is important to pay particular |
|                                   | attention to parents who work on  |
|                                   | a contract basis for less than 12 |
|                                   | months a year. For example, a     |
|                                   | contract teacher may have a       |
|                                   | contract ceasing in November but  |
|                                   | re-negotiates their contract in   |
|                                   | February the following year.      |
|                                   | During the intervening period,    |
|                                   | that person may state that they   |
|                                   | have no income however in the     |
|                                   | remainder of the child support    |
|                                   | period they will generally earn   |
|                                   | income. Ensure the customer is    |
|                                   | aware that they must advise if at |
|                                   | any time their estimate becomes   |
|                                   | inaccurate.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An example of where an estimate   |
|                                   | of zero may be reasonable is      |
|                                   | where a parent is being fully     |
|                                   | supported by their spouse and     |
|                                   | expects this arrangement to       |
|                                   | continue until the end of the     |
|                                   | elected estimate period. In this  |
|                                   | situation if it can be            |
|                                   | established that the parent will  |
|                                   | have no other source of taxable   |
|                                   | income, the estimate should be    |
|                                   | accepted.                         |

| 6                                 | Question: Can an estimate be      |
|                                   | backdated to start on a date      |
|                                   | prior to notification? + Read     |

|                                   | Answer: No. New estimates are     |
|                                   | prospective and only take effect  |
|                                   | from the date of notification.    |
|                                   | This will be the date of the      |
|                                   | phone call or the date the form   |
|                                   | is received.                      |
