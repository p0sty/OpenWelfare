on or after 1 July 2020 and before 1 July 2023, PPL is made up of:

-   a PPL period of up to 12 weeks (60 payable days), plus

-   meet a work test
-   meet an income test
-   meet Australian residence requirements
-   not be working on a PPL day
-   make an effective claim
-   birth mothers do not need to claim PPL first, or at all, in order
    for the other parent or partner to get PPL. Either parent or their
    partner can claim PPL first. Note: birth mothers do need to meet the
    work test if their partner, the child's biological father, or the
    child's biological father's partner claims

For children that are born or adopted before 1 July 2023:

-   be the primary carer of a PPL child
-   meet a work test (exemptions may apply for secondary/tertiary
    claimants)

claim for their newborn or adopted child.
