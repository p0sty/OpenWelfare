PPL details for customers with children born or entering care both
before and on or after 1 July 2023.

This document outlines how to identify if a customer has lodged a
pre-birth/entry into care claim for Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Parental
Leave Pay (PPL) or Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) and how to check the status
of the claim. Note: DAP is not payable for children born or adopted on
or after 1 July 2023. Fathers and partners will need to claim PPL.

Pre-claim benefit status

Once an early claim is processed, the benefit status can be:

-   pending (excludes PPL claims) or assessed, for example waiting for
    proof of the child's birth before the claim can be finalised
-   rejected if initial eligibility criteria were not met
-   not effective if information required to assess the customer's
    initial eligibility was not provided as requested, or if the claim
    was lodged outside the allowable early claim period
