This document outlines an explanation of how parents can claim Parental
Leave Pay (PPL), and/or Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for a newborn child and
enrol the child in Medicare and the Medicare Safety Net, My Health
Record and the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).

How to claim for a newborn child

[] Encourage customers to make an early claim online. This provides
customers with a streamlined experience and is the preferred service
offer. Ensure customers have 'active' online account access before
directing them to claim online.

If a customer contacts and is deemed unable or unsuitable to complete an
online claim, a verbal claim for Paid Parental Leave and family
assistance may be appropriate. The Assisted Customer Claim (ACC)
workflow can be completed for these customers. See Online and Assisted
Customer Claims (ACC) for Family Assistance, Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). Other payments have their own procedures
for claimants who cannot claim online.

Families in crisis or remote Indigenous customers

For families in crisis who are experiencing difficulty in understanding
or complying with claim requirements, or that require a speedy outcome
to meet immediate financial needs, or remote Indigenous customers who
have language or literacy barriers affecting their capacity to use forms
or online claims, a verbal claim for Paid Parental Leave and family
assistance may be appropriate. These customers may also be eligible to
submit a verbal signature declaration.

See:

-   Helping customers in crisis or financial hardship claim family
    assistance, or
-   Assisting Indigenous customers to claim family assistance and/or
    Paid Parental Leave scheme payments

A separate procedure applies for claiming Dad and Partner Pay (DAP).

Nominees

Nominees do not have access to lodge online claims (with the exception
of claims for Approved Child Care Benefit lump sum claims and Child Care
Subsidy (CCS)). Therefore correspondence nominees are to be offered an
Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) if available when they want to apply for a
family’s payment on behalf of their principal. If they decline ACC or it
is not available, then a paper-based claim form will need to be issued.

Child adoptions and bereavements

Separate procedures apply for customers claiming:

-   for a child entering care as part of an adoption process or
    surrogacy arrangement
-   for a child leaving care as part of an adoption process or surrogacy
    arrangement
-   after a stillbirth
-   after the death of a child (including soon after birth)

Verification of birth

The Newborn Child Declaration (FA081) is not a claim form but can be
used to verify the birth of a child when applying for Paid Parental
Leave scheme payments (Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay),
family assistance, Medicare enrolment and a My Health Record.

Each FA081 has a unique serial number on the back page. The serial
number is recorded when the customer lodges the FA081 as proof of birth
for a newborn child.

[] If a pre-birth claim has been lodged and assessed as pending proof of
birth, customers can then use the ‘Add newborn child’ service online or
'Add child service' via Express Plus Centrelink mobile app to provide
the details of their newborn child and upload the Doctor/Midwife Proof
of Birth declaration.

Note: this will also appear as a ‘task' on the landing page on the
customer's online account and/or mobile app.

Customers who do not have the FA081 can provide alternate proof of birth
(for example birth certificate) to support their claim and/or Medicare
enrolment, but child details and a claim must still be provided.

-   Helping customers provide proof of a child's birth
-   Processing proof of a child's birth

The FA081 can be used across Centrelink and Medicare programmes as proof
of birth. Additional information may be required (for example, a claim
for payment), but do not ask for another proof of birth document if the
FA081 is already receipted on the customer record.

[] Electronic Proof of Birth (EPoB) provided by participating hospitals
as part of the Newborn Enrolment Trial.

Parents must confirm child information through the Add Newborn child
service online or via the Add child service in the Express Plus mobile
app to utilise the EPoB as valid proof of birth.

Once a customer has confirmed the EPoB information through the Add
Newborn child service, these activities will be allocated to pilot staff
and the EPoB can be used:

-   create a child record
-   as proof of birth of a child if the customer has lodged a pre-birth
    claim for FTB and/or PPL
-   complete Medicare enrolment and register child for a My Health
    Record

See Newborn Enrolment Trial for more information about the trial and how
to help customers with their enquiries.

Timeframes for claiming

[] Encourage customers to lodge an early claim for family assistance
and/or Parental Leave Pay (PPL) online. Claims can be lodged up to 97
days before the child’s expected date of birth or entrustment to care as
part of an adoption process.

Claims can be lodged up to 52 weeks after their child’s date of birth or
entrustment to care, but advise customers of the time limits for
claiming the maximum PPL period.

For Parental Leave Pay to be paid from the date of birth or entry into
care, the customer must lodge an effective claim with their child’s
proof of birth/entry into care details within 28 days of the birth/entry
into care.

The 28 day period commences the day after the date of birth/entry into
care. If the customer lodges their claim or provides the required
information after the 28 days, the earliest possible PPL period start
date is the date of claim.

Customer in crisis or in hardship

For a family in crisis requiring urgent family assistance claim
processing, only certain team leaders or specialists should contact the
Team Leader in the local processing team to facilitate urgent
processing.

For a family experiencing financial hardship requiring urgent family
assistance claim processing, ensure the claim can be actioned before
transferring the customer to the Families and Child Care Branch Claim
Enquiry line. The Smart Centre Service Officer will action the claim if
possible or assess the appropriateness of a priority referral to
Families Processing. If not trained in that claim type, the Smart Centre
Service Officer will use the Families Claim Escalation - Hardship Fast
Note to prioritise the claim. See, Helping customer in crisis or
financial hardship claim family assistance.

For all other urgent claim processing, staff must follow protocols for
claims under day 35 and over day 35 as set out on the Process page of
Child enters customer's care/custody.

Customers overseas

Claims lodged by customers who are overseas, or who will be going
overseas within 21 days of claiming, are transferred to Families
International Claims (FIC) to be finalised.

If the customer is overseas when they claim and the child was born
overseas, an FA100 is to be issued if the customer is not claiming
online. This includes FTB current customers claiming while overseas. The
FA100 can be downloaded online or mailed to the customer overseas.

Various documents can be accepted as proof of birth for children born
overseas.

Medicare enrolment

If the customer advises their family has not enrolled in Medicare, the
Medicare Safety Net, or My Health Record (where consent is provided),
tell them to contact Medicare to arrange this.

If the customer is already enrolled for Medicare but their newborn is
not yet enrolled, the child's information provided in the online claim,
'Add newborn child' service or on the completed FA081 can be used to
enrol the newborn child. This information will be transferred to
Medicare when provided via a Centrelink service.

The child’s Medicare details are used to establish a link with the
Australian Immunisation Register to receive their immunisation status
for FTB.

Flexible PPL

For children that are born or adopted on or after 1 July 2020, PPL
includes 30 Flexible PPL days. Customers will be assessed for these days
when they claim PPL. If the customer does not connect all of their
Flexible PPL days to their PPL period, they can access these at a later
time without the need to lodge a new claim for PPL. Claiming and
managing Flexible Paid Parental Leave (PPL) days.

The Resources page contains an example of the 28 day count for the start
date of the PPL period, links to contact details and Services Australia
website, relevant forms and publications, and resources including the
Newborn Supplement (NBS) maximum rate map and information about claim
signature requirements.
