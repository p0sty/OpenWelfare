Update an employee's pay cycle

Steps for updating a linked employee's pay cycle

This table describes how to relink an employee to the correct pay cycle
in Cuba.

Note: if you are updating a pay cycle for an employee that has Employer
Withholding with Arrears (EWA) in place, the payment arrangement will
need to be ended prior to updating the pay cycle, and re-keyed when the
employee is on the correct pay cycle. See Employer withholding (linking)
Cuba Process Help.
