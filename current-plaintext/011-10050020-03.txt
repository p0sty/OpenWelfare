Create an ancillary provider organisation registration

Table 3: all ancillary provider applicants, including individuals, must
have an organisation registration created. If a pharmacist makes an
application and reports immunisation information to the AIR, the
application is not processed. Call the applicant to advise them of this.
They use a pharmacy (ancillary) provider number.
