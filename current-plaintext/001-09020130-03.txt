|                                   |     This will present a barrier   |

|                                   |     if the job seeker applies for |

|                                   | is appropriate for these          |
|                                   | customers. Importantly, a 13 week |
|                                   | MPC exemption should only be      |
|                                   | granted when a customer's         |
|                                   | circumstances make it             |
|                                   | unreasonable for them to meet any |
|                                   | of their mutual obligation        |

|                                   | consideration should be given to  |
