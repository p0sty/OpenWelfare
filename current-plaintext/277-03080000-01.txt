This document outlines the process for dealing with applications to
extend child support for a child after their 18^(th) birthday.

Extending a child support assessment when a child turns 18

A carer entitled to child support for a child who is turning 18 years of
age can apply to have their child support assessment extended (including
an assessment based on a child support agreement) provided the child
will be in full-time secondary education on their eighteenth birthday.

The child support assessment can be extended until the last day of the
secondary school year in the calendar year in which the child turns 18.
This includes periods prescribed by the school to be a term, semester or
school holiday break, and where it is intended that the child will
continue their secondary education after the end of the holiday.

A parent who has a relevant dependent child who is turning 18 years of
age can apply to have this child taken into account in any applicable
administrative assessment provided the relevant dependent child will be
in full-time secondary education on their 18^(th) birthday, consistent
with that described for child support children turning 18.

A secondary school includes a school, TAFE College or any other
educational institution that provides full-time secondary education. A
secondary school also includes a school that caters for the needs of
children with learning difficulties and provides a form of education
that is not tertiary education.

The Resources page contains links to a table of Australian
state/territory Department of Education websites, additional resources
about extending a child support assessment for a child turning 18 years
of age and links to manual letters.
