|                                   | STA when Term 1 commences for the |
|                                   | year, because:                    |

|                                   | -   Sarah did commence for the    |

|                                   | on the first day of school,       |
|                                   | because Millie did attend school  |
|                                   | in Term 1, and the parent was in  |
|                                   | receipt of a qualifying payment   |
|                                   | within the term entitlement       |
|                                   | period, Millie remains eligible   |
|                                   | for STA for Term 1.               |

|                                   | Isaac is the child of separated   |
|                                   | parents Mary and Frank. Isaac was |
|                                   | living with Mary up until 10      |
|                                   | January when the care arrangement |
|                                   | changed and Isaac went to live    |
|                                   | with Frank.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On 12 January, Frank submitted a  |
|                                   | Schooling A claim for Isaac. As   |
|                                   | Isaac will be in Frank's care     |
|                                   | during the school term, Frank     |
|                                   | will have the entitlement to      |
|                                   | receive the STA for Term 1.       |
|                                   | However, because Mary had some    |
|                                   | care of Isaac during the term     |
|                                   | entitlement period for Term 1,    |
|                                   | the system determines Mary will   |
|                                   | receive the full Term 1 STA       |
|                                   | payment. This is incorrect. To    |
|                                   | ensure Frank receives the STA     |
|                                   | payment for the term, Mary's ABT  |
|                                   | claim must be cancelled or        |
|                                   | rejected.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The cancellation or rejection     |
|                                   | will be from the first day of the |
|                                   | relevant term entitlement period  |
|                                   | (in this case from 1 January).    |
|                                   | Frank's claim will then be        |
|                                   | granted from 1 January. Record a  |
