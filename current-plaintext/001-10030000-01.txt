This document outlines the types of compliance action that may be
initiated by Community Development Program (CDP) providers.

Types of compliance action

When a CDP job seeker does not meet their compulsory requirements, the
CDP provider may choose to use the CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework
to improve engagement and reinforce mutual obligation requirements.

The types of compliance actions that can be initiated by a CDP provider
include:

-   suspension of payment via the submission of a Non-Attendance Report
    (NAR)
-   No Show, No Pay, connection, and serious failure, or Unemployment
    Non-Payment Period (UNPP) investigations including in some cases
    suspension of payment via the submission of Participation Reports
-   non-attendance and reconnection failure investigations via the
    submission of Provider Appointment Reports (PAR), or
-   Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA) via the submission of
    Comprehensive Compliance Assessment Requests where there are
    indicators the CDP job seeker has unidentified barriers to
    compliance

All provider initiated compliance actions require appropriate
consideration before a decision is made to apply a failure or UNPP. Once
Services Australia have investigated and made a decision regarding the
provider initiated compliance action, the outcome will be electronically
forwarded to the provider.

Attending compulsory CDP provider appointments

CDP job seekers who are receiving participation payments are required
to:

-   attend appointments with their provider when notified of a
    requirement to do so, and
-   contact their provider prior to the scheduled appointment start time
    if they will be unable to attend a compulsory appointment to discuss
    their reasons for this

When a CDP provider accepts the reasons why a CDP job seeker will be
unable to attend, the provider may reschedule the appointment and issue
a new connection requirement without initiating compliance action.

When a CDP job seeker fails to attend a regular or reconnection
appointment, a CDP provider may submit either a Non-Attendance Report
(NAR) to trigger suspension of payment or both a NAR and a Provider
Attendance Report (PAR) to trigger a compliance investigation for
Services Australia to investigate and finalise. The PAR will be used
only after the provider has spoken to the CDP job seeker about the
reason for non-compliance and considers the imposition of a financial
penalty as the best way to ensure future compliance by that CDP job
seeker.

Non-Attendance Reports (NAR)

If the provider decides to submit a NAR they are responsible for:

-   reporting a CDP job seeker's non-attendance at the compulsory
    appointment to Services Australia within 2 working days of the event
    to suspend payment
-   notifying the CDP job seeker their payment is no longer payable due
    to the missed appointment
-   discussing with the CDP job seeker their reasons for non-attendance,
    and
-   reconnecting the CDP job seeker following the submission of a NAR

The formal notification issued to the CDP job seeker to attend the
appointment will be attached to the NAR, and will include the date, time
and location of the appointment.

When a NAR has been submitted, the Services Australia system will
automatically:

-   suspend the CDP job seeker's payment with reason 'Non-Attendance
    Report Received' (ANR)
-   prevent the CDP job seeker from finalising their reporting statement
    until the ANR suspension is lifted
-   send a letter to the CDP job seeker notifying the suspension
    decision and that they must contact their provider to discuss the
    NAR
-   display messaging via self service (IVR, mobile app and the online
    landing page) advising the CDP job seeker to contact their provider
    regarding the outstanding NAR

Generally suspension occurs from the start of the instalment period in
which the NAR is received or the day after the date paid or reported to
(whichever is the later) unless payment has already been suspended for
another reason. In these cases, the ANR suspension is automatically
applied once the other suspension is lifted.

CDP job seekers need to contact the provider to discuss the outstanding
NAR. During this contact, the provider is responsible for:

-   determining if the NAR is still required
-   determining if reconnection is required and negotiating a suitable
    re-engagement appointment within 2 days
-   notifying the CDP job seeker of the reconnection requirement,
    including providing them with the appropriate compliance warnings
-   recording the CDP job seeker's acceptance or refusal of the
    reconnection requirement, and
-   finalising the NAR so information will be electronically transmitted
    to the Services Australia system

The job seeker's payment will be automatically restored once the
provider finalises the NAR and:

-   updates the CDP job seeker's record to verify attendance at a
    re-engagement appointment for the submitted NAR, or
-   updates the NAR to advise the CDP job seeker is no longer required
    to attend the re-engagement appointment

In limited circumstances, PST-skilled Service Officers with WNPPD or
PFDEC security resources are able to manually finalise a NAR. See
Restoring payment where a payment suspension (participation) has been
imposed for Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers for further
details.

Provider Appointment Reports (PAR)

If the provider decides to submit a PAR for the CDP job seeker's
non-attendance at the compulsory appointment (including reconnection
appointments), the provider is responsible for:

-   reporting a CDP job seeker's non-attendance at the compulsory
    appointment via a NAR
-   notifying the CDP job seeker their participation payment is not
    payable due to the appointment they missed
-   discussing the reasons for non-attendance with the job seeker
-   reconnecting the CDP job seeker during the discussion, and
-   submitting a valid PAR for the same non-attendance event date as the
    NAR, triggering either a Non-Attendance Failure or a reconnection
    failure for Services Australia to investigate

Note: providers are unable to have a PAR withdrawn once it has been
submitted.

Providers can however supply additional evidence to Services Australia
to assist Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officers
determine whether:

-   the compliance action generated as a result of the PAR was invalid,
    or
-   the CDP job seeker had a reasonable excuse and a valid reason for
    not making prior contact (where applicable)

The type of failure generated from a PAR depends on the type of
appointment the CDP job seeker did not attend. Failure to attend:

-   a 'regular' appointment will result in a non-attendance failure
-   an appointment that was a reconnection requirement will result in a
    reconnection failure

The following provider re-engagement appointment type is booked by
Services Australia:

-   RAPRC - Re-engagement appointment booked for a connection or
    reconnection failure
-   RACOA - Re-engagement appointment booked for a serious failure
    waiver

Note: re-engagement appointments booked for a serious failure waiver
(RACOA) will trigger the re-application of the serious failure where
they are finalised with a 'Did not attend result - invalid (DNAI)' or
'Did not enter Job Plan (DNEP)'. A NAR and/or PAR are not used in these
circumstances.

Participation Reports for other types of non-compliance

When a CDP job seeker is non-compliant with a compulsory connection
requirement (other than non-attendance at a compulsory provider
appointment), the CDP provider may submit a Participation Report to
notify Services Australia they wish to pursue formal compliance action.

The provider may submit a Participation Report to trigger compliance
action as a result of:

-   non-attendance at a compulsory third party appointment the provider
    has arranged
-   refusal to enter a Job Plan
-   non-attendance at a job interview
-   failure to meet job search requirements
-   misconduct at an appointment
-   inappropriate behaviour at a job interview
-   refusal or failure to start suitable work
-   leaving a job voluntarily or dismissal due to misconduct

A Participation Report may result in the investigation of the following
types of compliance action:

-   a No Show, No Pay failure
-   a connection failure
-   a serious failure, or
-   an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP)

When a Participation Report is received for a connection failure the CDP
job seeker's payment may be suspended until they agree to re-engage
(with their provider) or it is determined re-engagement is no longer
required.

All provider generated investigations require consideration of the
circumstances relevant to the incident before a decision is made to
apply a failure or UNPP.

All Participation Reports submitted to Services Australia for
consideration must be in a valid format. A valid format includes:

-   details of the compliance action that requires investigation
-   details of the formal notification provided to the CDP job seeker
    regarding their requirement to attend an appointment, or details of
    the CDP job seeker's agreement to comply with a requirement
-   other relevant information which may assist Services Australia
    investigate the compliance action

Suspension of CDP job seeker payment

A CDP job seeker's payment may be automatically suspended following the
generation of a Non-Attendance Report (NAR) or a connection/reconnection
failure.

Where payment has been suspended following receipt of a:

-   NAR (suspension reason 'Non-Attendance Report Received' - ANR), the
    CDP job seeker will be prompted to contact their provider who is
    responsible for re-engaging the CDP job seeker and sending an
    electronic transaction that will automatically lift the suspension
-   connection failure (suspension reason 'did not attend participation
    appointment' - APA), the CDP job seeker will be prompted to contact
    Services Australia to discuss the compliance action. The
    Participation Solutions Team (PST) skilled Service Officer will book
    the re-engagement appointment and manually lift the suspension after
    the CDP job seeker accepts this

Financial penalties

The CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework focuses on encouraging CDP job
seekers receiving participation payments to remain engaged with their
CDP provider and to comply with their mutual obligation requirements.
Financial penalties are only imposed for failures within a CDP job
seeker's control, for example, as a result of deliberate or persistent
non-compliance.

A financial penalty may occur as a result of the following types of
compliance action:

-   No Show, No Pay failures
-   non-attendance failures
-   reconnection failures
-   serious failures
-   Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP)

CDP job seekers who incur a No Show, No Pay failure, connection failure,
non-attendance failure or reconnection failure are encouraged to
re-engage quickly to avoid or reduce financial penalties.

CDP job seekers who incur a serious failure are encouraged to attend a
waiver re-engagement appointment in lieu of serving some or all of the
serious failure period. CDP job seekers who do not have the capacity to
attend the waiver re-engagement appointment and are in severe financial
hardship may be eligible for payment under hardship provisions during
the serious failure penalty period. Hardship provisions may also be
considered where the CDP job seeker has a UNPP applied and is in a class
of persons as specified in the relative Legislative Instrument.

In some cases, a CDP job seeker demonstrating ongoing non-compliance may
have their participation payment cancelled due to loss of qualification.

Services Australia roles and responsibilities

Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers are
responsible for helping CDP job seekers:

-   by telling them to contact their CDP provider following the
    submission of a Non-Attendance Report (NAR), including giving them
    the CDP provider's contact details if needed, or
-   with the review and appeal process where the CDP job seeker has
    requested an explanation or applied for a formal review of the
    decision

Provider Appointment Reports (PAR) and Participation Reports

PST-skilled Service Officers with a PFDEC/WNPPD security resource are
responsible for investigating compliance action triggered by a PAR or
Participation Report. Contact will be established with the CDP job
seeker to provide opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to
non-compliance before a decision is made regarding compliance action.

PST-skilled Service Officers will not be required to re-engage the CDP
job seeker or restore payment for PARs. This is part of the NAR process
that the provider is responsible for completing.

managing compliance with compulsory requirements.
