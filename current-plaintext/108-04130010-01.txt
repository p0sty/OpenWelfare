This document outlines information on real estate that may have an asset
value and is subject to the assets test. This can be, but is not limited
to, an investment property, holiday home, timeshare, a business
conducted from the principal home. Property owned under a timeshare
arrangement is assessed differently from other real estate.

The principal home

The residence where a customer spends the greatest amount of time is
their principal home. The principal home and the private land
(curtilage) adjoining the home are usually not considered assets under
the assets test. A separate procedure explains how to assess house and
curtilage.

Customers who leave their principal home due to illness and have to
enter care may have their home exempted from the assets test.

Value of real estate

A customer may own or be paying off other real estate, including
overseas real estate (that is, holiday home, house, unit, flat, vacant
land or land not allowed as curtilage). To determine the assessable
asset value, consider:

-   the net market value of the property (and its contents)
-   the customer's share of ownership in the property
-   any outstanding loans secured against the property
-   any other encumbrance the property may be subject to, such as life
    interests

Damaged assets

When an asset is damaged, for example due to an emergency event such as
flood, fire or cyclone its current market value is affected. If the
customer advises the market value of the asset has reduced due to
significant damage, see Maintaining the value of real estate assets on
customer records. This current market value should be assessed
irrespective of any insurance that may be payable.

Encumbrances over property assets

The assessable market value of an asset is reduced by the amount of any
outstanding charge or encumbrance over the asset. However, a charge or
encumbrance cannot be deducted if:

-   it is for the benefit of a person other than the customer or the
    customer's partner
-   it is a collateral security
-   the asset it is secured against is an exempt asset

If a charge or encumbrance is secured against:

both an exempt asset and an assessable asset, the amount of the
outstanding charge or encumbrance is shared between the assets in
proportion to the asset values. To determine the amount of the loan to
be deducted as a liability:

-   (value of secured loan x value of assessable property)/value of all
    properties (assessable property + exempt property + any other
    properties covered by the secured loan).
    In most cases, the customer's estimated value of the exempt asset,
    for example, the principal home, is accepted. If it appears the
    value is completely unreasonable, normal valuation processes are
    followed

more than one assessable asset, the amount of the outstanding charge or
encumbrance is shared between the assets in proportion to the asset
values. To determine the amount of the loan to be deducted as a
liability against each assessable property:

-   (value of secured loan X value of assessable property)/value of all
    properties (the total of all assessable properties covered by the
    secured loan)

Tenants in common

Customers who own real estate as 'tenants in common', have their share
assessed based on the agreed ownership percentage. For example, if a
customer owns 40 per cent of the property, 40 per cent of the whole
property value is used. This differs from customers who own real estate
as 'joint tenants' with one or more people, in which case the property
is assessed in equal proportions. Any applicable home and curtilage is
exempt from the assets test in both these cases if the real estate is
considered as the principal home.

Partially constructed home

A partially constructed home is assessed as an asset if:

Before 1 January 2023:

-   the customer is building a new principal home from the proceeds of
    the sale of their former principal home and the allowable period of
    12 months has elapsed, and an extended exemption period of up to an
    additional 12 months has not been granted, or
-   the customer is building a new principal home because they
    demolished their former home and the temporary absence period of 12
    months has elapsed, and an extended exemption period of up to an
    additional 12 months has not been granted, or
-   the customer is building a home and neither the sale of home
    provisions nor the temporary absence provisions apply

From 1 January 2023:

-   the customer is building a new principal home from the proceeds of
    the sale of their former family home and the allowable period of 24
    months has elapsed, and an extended exemption period of up to an
    additional 12 months has not been granted, or
-   the customer is building a new principal home because they
    demolished their former home and the temporary absence period of 12
    months has elapsed, and an extended exemption period of up to an
    additional 12 months has not been granted, or
-   the customer is building a home and neither the sale of home
    provisions nor the temporary absence provisions apply

If the partially constructed home is to be assessed as an asset, an
estimate of the value of the property is needed from the customer.

If the customer advises they have made progress payments, the following
details are also needed:

-   amount and frequency of progress payments
-   amount of the progress payment which represents the labour costs
-   the customer's revised estimate of the property value
-   how long before the property will be fully constructed
-   if the property will become the customer's principal home
-   the source of the progress payments

If the property will not become the customer's principal home, a formal
valuation on completion may be needed to determine the value of the
fully constructed home.

Documents required for valuations

Information for assessing real estate is collected from the Real estate
details (MOD R) form and supporting documents. These may include:

-   evidence of any mortgage on the property
-   latest council rates/valuation notice
-   certificate of title or any other title document

Centrelink International Services (CIS) may accept alternative source
documents for overseas real estate instead of a valuation (for example,
Italian tax returns).

Real estate owned via shares in a private company

Real estate owned via shares in a private company is assessed via trust
and company rules.

Capital gains

If the customer makes a capital gain when they sell their property, no
income is assessed for income support payments. Capital gains may be
assessed when a private trust or private company makes a capital profit.
A capital gain in an unincorporated business, such as a partnership, is
not usually assessed, unless it forms part of the normal activity of the
business, for example, property development.

Property Options for Pensioners and Investors (POPI)

A homeowner (the seller) may enter into a call option agreement with a
buyer for the sale of their principal residence. The agreement sets out
the ultimate purchase price the buyer will pay, and is unique in that it
has no end date, allowing it to continue long term.

There are 2 trigger events that activate the option agreement:

-   death of the seller (or nominated resident for those couples where
    both are not on the title)
-   desire of the seller to sell

The option agreement is not triggered when the seller:

-   leaves the property
-   rents the property

The seller receives an upfront option fee on execution of the agreement.

The seller also receives an ongoing option fee. This ongoing option fee
is payable monthly by the buyer to the seller via a trust account for up
to a maximum of 20 years. These payments reduce every 5 years; for
example, a house with an initial value of $400,000 would receive around
$9,000 per year for the first 5 years.

If a trigger event occurs within the first 3 years, the buyer has the
option to request a full refund of all payments made without any
interest added.

Assessment for customers (the seller):

-   the amount received is not income
-   they are assessed as homeowners and the house is their asset until
    they have sold their home
-   there is no deprivation if they have entered into an arm's length
    commercial arrangement

This procedure does not apply to family assistance or Paid Parental
Leave (PPL) as they are not asset tested. However, the impact on the
customer's Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) should be checked.

Calculator.
