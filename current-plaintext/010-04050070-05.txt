Student Programme Resource Tool

The Student Programme Resource Tool contains useful reference
information and links. It includes:

-   Allowable Time Calculator
-   Distance Education & Private Provider Date Calculator
-   Long Term Income Support Calculator

The tool can only be used to assist with Allowable Time Assessments if
all study undertaken at the Institution is studied under the current
Term/Semester structure. If the student has studied at the same
institution under different structures the tool will not be able to
assist with the assessment for study within the previous structure. A
manual allowable time assessment is required.

|                                   | Students will not always maintain |
|                                   | a steady work load for the        |
|                                   | duration of a long course. A      |
|                                   | full-time student may choose to   |
|                                   | do some of the course on a        |
|                                   | part-time basis and vice versa.   |
|                                   | Each section of the course should |
|                                   | be looked at separately if        |
|                                   | possible.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Most courses are divided into     |
|                                   | academic periods. The standard    |
|                                   | divisions are:                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   whole years,                  |
|                                   | -   semesters (2 periods per      |
|                                   |     year), or                     |
|                                   | -   trimesters (3 periods per     |
|                                   |     year)                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is easy to look at each period |
|                                   | separately in these cases but     |
|                                   | some courses, particularly those  |
|                                   | offered by private providers, do  |
|                                   | not have any divisions. These     |
|                                   | types of courses often have a     |
|                                   | rolling start date (for example,  |
|                                   | the course starts any Monday) and |
|                                   | will finish a set number of weeks |
|                                   | later. In these cases the course  |
|                                   | is looked at as a whole.          |

|                                   | The general rule for Austudy is   |
|                                   | that a student can continue to be |
|                                   | paid up to the point at which     |
|                                   | they should have completed the    |
|                                   | course. For example, a student in |
|                                   | a three year bachelor degree who  |
|                                   | has already completed three and a |
|                                   | half years of study at that level |
|                                   | would be expected to have         |
|                                   | completed the course. The delay   |
|                                   | in completing the course is not   |
|                                   | always the fault of the student.  |
|                                   | For this reason, allowance is     |
|                                   | made to disregard some, or all,   |
|                                   | earlier study in certain          |
|                                   | circumstances.                    |

|                                   | The following periods can be      |
|                                   | disregarded:                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   A failed year (or part of a   |
|                                   |     year) if failure was due to   |
|                                   |     illness or other              |

|                                   |     has been permanently          |
|                                   |     discontinued because of       |

|                                   |     David's BA will be counted as |

|                                   | course is a 3 year degree and is  |
|                                   | comprised of semester based       |
|                                   | subjects (2 semesters per year).  |
|                                   | The maximum allowable time for    |
|                                   | this degree is 3.5 years.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As John has completed study at an |
|                                   | equivalent level within the past  |
|                                   | 10 years from the commencement of |
|                                   | John’s current course, all of the |
|                                   | previous study is taken into      |
|                                   | account at the commencement of    |
|                                   | the 2015 Bachelor of Business     |
|                                   | degree. This is because John’s    |
|                                   | previous study was not completed  |
|                                   | more than 10 years ago.           |

|                                   | John’s allowable time for his     |
|                                   | Bachelor of Business degree is    |
|                                   | 3.5 years. The normal amount of   |
|                                   | time for this Bachelor of Science |
|                                   | course is 3 years. This is        |
|                                   | subtracted from his allowable     |
|                                   | time for his current course. This |
|                                   | leaves John with 0.5 years of     |
|                                   | allowable time to complete his    |
|                                   | Bachelor of Business degree.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Once John has exceeded 0.5 years  |
|                                   | of allowable time, the decision   |
|                                   | cannot be reviewed at a later     |
|                                   | date to disregard the previous    |
|                                   | study. For example, if another    |
|                                   | claim is lodged while still       |
|                                   | undertaking the same course, the  |
|                                   | allowable time calculation cannot |
|                                   | be reset. This means John is      |
|                                   | payable up to the day before he   |
|                                   | commences semester 1, in 2016, as |
|                                   | John would not have exceeded his  |
|                                   | allowable time at the             |
|                                   | commencement of semester 2, 2015. |

|                                   | each period as a percentage of a  |
|                                   | whole academic year. Therefore,   |
|                                   | typically a semester's full-time  |
|                                   | study load would equal 50% of a   |
|                                   | year, a trimester's 33.3% and so  |
|                                   | on. If the study in a period was  |
|                                   | part-time then the appropriate    |
|                                   | fraction would be used (e.g. a    |
|                                   | student undertakes two subjects   |
|                                   | out of the usual four in a        |
|                                   | semester - this would equal 25%   |
|                                   | of a full years study). The study |
|                                   | load percentage for a specific    |
|                                   | study period may vary depending   |
|                                   | on how the institution structures |
|                                   | their enrolments. Therefore, it   |
|                                   | is important to check the         |

|                                   | but the third period is optional, |
|                                   | the full-time study load may be   |

|                                   | study calculations. For example a |

|                                   | five subjects in a semester is    |
|                                   | counted as 50% of the year's      |
|                                   | study load (not 40%). If a        |
|                                   | customer overloads in a semester  |
|                                   | or year, it is counted as 50%     |
|                                   | (0.5) or 100% (1.0) respectively, |
|                                   | and not the overload figure. For  |
|                                   | example, if a customer undertook  |

|                                   | now four times the minimum time   |

|                                   | three year course (one third of   |
|                                   | the total) becomes the equivalent |
|                                   | of four years of the allowable    |
|                                   | twelve (again one third of the    |
|                                   | total).                           |

|                                   | Therefore, six subjects taken     |
|                                   | over two years would be counted   |
|                                   | as one and a half four-subject    |
|                                   | semesters (or 75% of a full years |
