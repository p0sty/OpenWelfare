This document outlines special considerations when managing job seeker
compliance for job seekers affected by a natural disaster, declared
emergency or assisting with a recovery effort through a registered
organisation.

Where 'job seeker' is referenced, this includes Community Development
Program (CDP) participants.

Job seeker affected by a natural disaster or declared emergency

Service Officers assisting job seekers with outstanding compliance
action are expected to display an appropriate level of sensitivity and
discretion when a job seeker has been significantly affected by a
natural disaster or declared emergency and/or is assisting with a
recovery effort through a registered organisation.

A similar level of sensitivity is required when a location is affected
by a significant event, for example, severe weather, but a formal
emergency declaration has not been made.

Service Officers should consider a referral to external support services
and social work crisis intervention where appropriate.

Capacity to comply with compulsory requirements

Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, are required to meet
compulsory requirements in return for receiving a participation payment.

A natural disaster or declared emergency may affect a job seeker's
capacity to meet their compulsory requirements, including the
requirement for prior contact to advise of an inability to attend. An
exemption from mutual obligation requirements may be appropriate.

Service Officers can check whether the disaster or emergency is listed
as a current event. For more information, see Emergency management
events or the Resources page for a link to the Indigenous Community
Events page.

Contingency arrangements

The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and/or the
National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) may invoke contingency
arrangements for Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) and Community
Development Program (CDP) job seekers respectively when impacts are more
widely spread. When this occurs, Services Australia is notified of any
action taken.

When formal contingency arrangements have been invoked for a natural disaster or declared emergency

Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) job seekers

Where DEWR decides to invoke contingency, the following actions are
generally implemented:

Participation reports for non-compliance are automatically finalised, if
contact with the job seeker has not occurred

If a job seeker contacts Services Australia during the contingency
period and there is:

-   an active mutual obligation failure on their record, priority should
    be given to finalising these compliance investigations. Job seekers
    are unable to finalise reporting until a determination has been made
    about the active failure
-   an outstanding work refusal failure or unemployment failure on their
    record, it must be assessed in accordance with normal processes, or
    any advice for the specific event
-   an outstanding Capability Assessment on their record, it must be
    actioned via usual processes

Community Development Program (CDP) participants

Where the NIAA decides to invoke contingency, they will direct CDP
providers and Services Australia to undertake appropriate actions. These
generally include:

The NIAA instructs CDP providers in impacted regions or communities not
to submit any Provider Reports for non-compliance during the suspension
of mutual obligation requirements

CDP participants are not required to attend face-to-face appointments
with their provider (appointments may be conducted over the phone)

DEWR automatically lifts all outstanding Non-Attendance Reports (NAR),
which will restore suspended payments

If a job seeker contacts Services Australia during the contingency
period and there is:

-   an outstanding Comprehensive Compliance Assessment (CCA) on their
    record, it must be finalised without penalty
-   an outstanding failure on their record, it must be rejected,
    including, serious failures for refusing to accept or failing to
    commence a suitable job, and serious failures for persistent
    non-compliance

The following penalties that were previously applied and are currently
being served (or have a future start date) must be ended/waived:

-   serious failure periods
-   penalties applied due to a reconnection failure, or non-attendance
    failure

Note:

-   Unemployment Failures and Unemployment Non-Payment Periods (UNPP)
    are generally not impacted by contingency arrangements and are
    managed via usual processes, unless otherwise advised
-   When formal contingency arrangements have been invoked,
    Participation Solutions Team (PST) staff must refer to operational
    messaging and follow any task cards authorised by the Job Seeker
    Compliance Team associated with the relevant event

When formal contingency arrangements have not been invoked

PST staff investigating compliance action must use their discretion and
consider how the natural disaster, declared emergency or significant
event has affected the job seeker's capacity to meet their compulsory
requirements. Factors may include, but are not limited to:

-   how the job seeker was personally affected
-   impacts on their primary residence or action the job seeker needed
    to take to make their property safe
-   transport and accessibility issues in the area
-   impacts on care arrangements for children
-   impacts on communication networks
-   involvement in a recovery effort through a registered organisation,
    or
-   effect of the disaster/emergency on their provider or the location
    of a requirement

In some cases, a serious event may be localised or still developing and
may not be listed on Emergency management events or Indigenous Community
Events (see the Resources page for a link).

If a job seeker claims to have been affected by a natural disaster or
local emergency event that is not listed, staff are expected to use
their discretion to:

-   decide how much weight to give to the customer's statement. Staff
    may use other sources to verify the customer's statements. For
    example, local knowledge, or contacting the provider. The source
    needs to be documented if it is used to make a decision
-   consider how the natural disaster or declared emergency has affected
    the job seeker's capacity to meet their compulsory requirements
