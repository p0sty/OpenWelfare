|                                   | YA. On the day the claim is       |
|                                   | lodged (1 December 2015), Ross is |
|                                   | aged 21. However, Ross has asked  |
|                                   | to delay the start day/payability |
|                                   | of YA until turning 22 years of   |

|                                   | Ross started an approved course   |
|                                   | on a full-time basis on 1 March   |
|                                   | 2015. However, Ross only          |
|                                   | undertook one subject as a        |

|                                   | to resume full-time study on 29   |
|                                   | February 2016. The claim and      |
|                                   | supporting documents confirm that |

|                                   | In Ross' case, requalification    |
|                                   | occurs from the day Ross is       |

|                                   | who starts year 12 in February.   |
|                                   | The YA claim states Nicola has    |
|                                   | $6,200 in savings (from part-time |
|                                   | work). When Nicola turns 18 on 18 |
|                                   | May, a claim for YA is lodged.    |
|                                   | However, while qualified for YA,  |
|                                   | the YA payment is precluded until |

|                                   | right after the LAWP ends.        |

For information about liquid assets, how they affect payments, the LAWP
and exemptions from the waiting period, see the Services Australia
website, Liquid assets waiting period.

Impact of coronavirus (COVID-19)

From 25 March 2020 to 24 September 2020 inclusive, new claims had the
LAWP automatically waived.

This included:

-   new claims
-   customers who were serving a LAWP (for example, their waiting period
    ended on 30 May 2020). The LAWP was manually waived from the date
    the waiting period started
-   customers who served their waiting period and started to receive
    payment (for example, their waiting period ended on 26 March 2020)

Customers did not need to show financial hardship for these waiting
periods to be waived.

The LAWP was reinstated from 25 September 2020. The system will continue
to waive the LAWP when it is determined to be appropriate. This includes
when claims are backdated to start before 25 September 2020.

If the claim was backdated to before 25 September 2020, the LAWP
continued to be waived due to COVID-19.

If the claim is being backdated to before 25 September 2020, code a
manual claim date on the NSA Start Date Calculator (NDC) screen that
equals the start date.

This will make sure the LAWP is correctly waived.
