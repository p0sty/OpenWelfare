Severe facial lipoatrophy and listing dates

Severe facial lipoatrophy is a rare condition described by the
disappearance of facial subcutaneous fat. Polylactic acid is an
injectable liquid used to add volume to areas of the face to create a
soft, natural, more youthful re-contouring of the face from severe
facial lipoatrophy caused by therapy for HIV infection only. It builds
the body's own collagen while it gradually disappears.

Listing dates:
