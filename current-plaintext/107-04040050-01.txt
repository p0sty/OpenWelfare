This document outlines information on the special arrangements for
recovering debts raised through the International Data Exchange
Programme (DEX).

Identified recoverable debt

Once information is exchanged, debts may arise where a customer has
either not declared that they receive a payment from the other country
or have underdeclared the rate of payment received. Once a debt has been
identified as recoverable, the debt is raised in accordance with normal
debt raising procedures. See Debt raising.

Non-standard withholdings for DEX

For debts raised under the International Data Exchange Programme, the
special negotiated recovery option is a maximum of $50 per fortnight.
The $50 repayment rate is not to be reviewed or changed for the period
of the debt.

Customers should not be asked for cash or lump sum payments and no
enforcement action, that is, legal recovery, garnishee etc., is to be
pursued.

Note: customers may request to repay the debt at a higher rate and
reduced withholdings can be negotiated as usual by the customer if they
are having difficulty repaying the debt.

and Centrelink International Services (CIS).
