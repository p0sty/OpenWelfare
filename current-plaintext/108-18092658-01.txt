Description

RA is a supplementary payment made to eligible customers receiving:

-   a pension
-   a benefit
-   ABSTUDY, or
-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB)

RA may also be paid when the customer does not qualify for FTB because
they have a Regular Care Child.

The customer must be paying rent for their principal home above a set
threshold amount based on their family circumstances.

The Process page has an A-Z listing of Rent Assistance (RA) terms,
screens and coding options.

The Resources page contains examples of common AC screen coding errors
that do not impact payment correctness.
