If a child is in immediate danger or risk of harm you must act, and a
delegate must call 000.

This document explains the service social workers provide to the
Payments and Integrity Group. Social workers provide support and
professional consultation to Payments and Integrity staff in their
engagement with customers.

Child safe framework

Services Australia has a zero tolerance approach to child abuse.

A staff member must act when they see or hear behaviour that raises
concern about a child or young person’s safety.

Follow the agency’s Risk Identification and Reporting model when
identifying and responding to child safety concerns. See Risk
identification and management of threats to the safety or welfare of a
child.

Customer needs social work assistance

Social work priorities

Social workers are focused on providing support to customers with highly
complex needs. Priority is given to:

-   people who are at risk of suicide or self-harm
-   young people without adequate support
-   people affected by family and domestic violence
-   people impacted by disasters and emergencies

Consultation

Service Officers can consult with social workers about how to
effectively interact with people experiencing significant
vulnerabilities. Social workers can provide help with internal and
external options of support for vulnerable customers.

Social work recommendations

All social workers can provide professional recommendations about:

-   special circumstances debt waivers, and
-   compensation preclusion periods

A social worker can provide information to help a delegate make a
decision about a:

-   special circumstances waiver, or
-   compensation preclusion period

In these cases, the social worker will assess a person's circumstances
and provide a recommendation. See the Process page for further
information.

Online Document Recording (ODR) may be used if the:

-   matter is not complex, and
-   total debt for consideration for a waiver is under $1,000

Consult a Payment and Integrity Group social worker if the case is
complex or involves a large debt over $10,000. See the Resources page
for contact details.

Customers talking about suicide or self-harm

Customer talking about suicide or self-harm

If a customer talks about suicide or self-harm refer direct referral is
needed via the following avenues:

If there is no social worker locally available, contact the Social Work
Line

-   Choose 'option 1' from the IVR list for priority access to a social
    worker. The call will be answered by the next available social
    worker

If a social worker is unavailable, notify a Team Leader/Manager
immediately

For more information see Customers talking about suicide or self-harm

These referrals are prioritised. It is mandatory for staff to refer
customers who may be at risk of suicide or self-harm.

Note: staff must not use the Social Work guided procedure to refer
customers who are at risk of suicide or self-harm.

Payment Assurance Service Officers

If a customer presents talking about suicide or self-harm to a Payment
Assurance Service Officer:

-   Attempt to contact a Payment and Integrity Group (P&I) social
    worker. Use the contacts list on Office Locator (code BSW)
-   If there is no P&I social worker available, contact the social work
    line and choose option 1 from the IVR
-   If a social worker is unavailable, notify a Team Leader/Manager
    immediately

The Payments and Integrity social work team

The Payments and Integrity Social Work team is a 'virtual' team of
social workers located across Payments and Integrity sites. They deliver
a service across the Divisions in the Payments and Integrity Group.

A Social Work Support Manager in the Payments and Integrity Social Work
team can provide professional recommendations about:

-   vulnerability reports prior to the execution of search warrants
-   vulnerability reports for fraud investigation cases prior to
    referral to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution

Internal Fraud Control Investigation referrals and support

Direct social work support, if required, is provided by telephone.
Social work staff do not attend the execution of warrants.

Fraud Investigations branch – search warrants

Guidelines state that before the execution of the search warrant, social
work review is mandatory.

A file assessment completed by a Payments and Integrity Social Work
Support Manager (SWSM) is conducted and a summary of risks provided to
the Fraud Investigations Branch.

Under no circumstances does the social worker contact the customer
before the execution of a search warrant.

The Payments and Integrity SWSM role in warrant execution is to support
the investigation team and if the circumstances require, provide
outbound telephone support to customers who are suicidal or at risk of
harm

Fraud Investigations branch- requests from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)

This process outlines a request for social work authored documents or
call recordings for release to the DPP.

Staff should follow the agreed process:

Fraud Investigations Branch requests social work authored documents
directly from Payments and Integrity (P&I) Social Work Support Manager
(SWSM).This is required as part of an investigation

P&I SWSM collects these documents (in PDF format) and completes a file
assessment of the customer's record. They will review the content of the
documents to be released and identify any:

-   sensitivities or risks to the customer and third parties, or
-   other concerns based on customer circumstances

The P&I SWSM provides the documents and any considerations regarding the
use of the social work authored content, to both Fraud Investigations
Branch and social work referrals via email concurrently

If a P&I SWSM is unavailable, the Fraud Investigations Branch can email
social work referrals directly to request:

-   completion of a file assessment, and
-   the provision of the required social work authored documents

Social work call recordings (if available) that are required, as part of
an investigation must be collected by the Fraud Investigations Branch.
They must be included in a request email sent directly to social work
referrals mailbox. The Professional Service Delivery Operations Team
(PSDO) in the Social Work Services Branch have oversight of these
requests, and provide guidance to social workers on the correct
processes for the external release of social work authored documents.

The Resources page contains a link to contact details for social work
referrals.
