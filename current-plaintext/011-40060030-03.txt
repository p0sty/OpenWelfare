Set a return mail indicator

Table 11: this table describes how to set a return mail indicator on a
CDMS customer record. When mail is returned to Medicare marked as ‘Not
at this address’ or ‘Return to sender’ it is necessary to set an
indicator on the customer’s record to alert the system not
correspondence or cards to that address until the address has been
updated.
