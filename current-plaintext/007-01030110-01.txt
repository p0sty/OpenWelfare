This document outlines how Service officers in Indigenous Smart Centre
Call and service centres dealing with Indigenous customers from remote
communities can help them claim family assistance and Paid Parental
Leave scheme payments.

Claim assistance for Indigenous customers

Service Officers can help Indigenous customers living in remote
communities who have language or literacy barriers affecting their
capacity to complete an online claim or use forms.

Service Officers can help these customers claim one or more of the
following payments:

-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB), which can include Newborn Supplement (NBS)
    and Newborn Upfront Payment (NBU) if the customer is not eligible
    for Parental Leave Pay for a newborn or adopted child
-   Parental Leave Pay (PPL)
-   Dad and Partner Pay (DAP). Note: DAP is not payable for children
    born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023. Fathers and partners will
    need to claim PPL
-   Stillborn Baby Payment (SBP)

A customer must meet the following criteria for this assistance to be
available:

-   reside in a remote Indigenous community whose access to Services
    Australia is normally via an agent, Remote Service Centre or
    telephone
-   identify as Indigenous
-   have language or literacy barriers

Claims for Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy
(ACCS)

If a customer needs help with claiming CCS/ACCS, Service Officers must
complete an Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) if the customer:

-   does not have access to a suitable device and/or the internet
-   is not eligible to register for self service, or
-   is deemed unable or unsuitable to complete an online claim

Customers are not required to meet the additional criteria noted above
for Service Officers to complete an assisted claim. See Claiming Child
Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS).

Verbal claim

Assisted Customer Claim (ACC) can be run with Indigenous customers who
have language or literacy barriers affecting their capacity to complete
an online claim or use forms.

Before starting ACC, update the customer's personal details using the
Change in Contact Details workflow as these questions are no longer
asked in the ACC. If ACC has started before the workflow being run, the
claim can be saved and updates made outside of the claim before
submitting it.

If a customer cannot lodge their claim online, before the claim can be
submitted, the customer will need to make a verbal signature declaration
or sign and return a Families Declaration form (FDF).

Claim procedures where eligibility for assistance is not met

For customers not eligible for this assistance, separate procedures
apply. See:

-   claiming family assistance and Parental Leave Pay (PPL) for a
    newborn child
-   claiming Dad and Partner Pay (DAP)
-   initial contact after a stillbirth
-   claiming FTB as a lump sum for a previous financial year

entry hub and contact details for the Bereavement/Double Orphan Pension
Helpdesk.
