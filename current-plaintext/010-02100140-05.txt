|                                   | George is a full time student in  |
|                                   | the second year of a law degree.  |
|                                   | George receives ABSTUDY and is    |
|                                   | eligible for FAA.                 |

|                                   | In March, George’s grandparent    |
|                                   | gets pneumonia. George asks for   |
|                                   | compassionate travel to visit, as |
|                                   | the condition is critical.        |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | George's grandparent recovers and |
|                                   | George returns to study. In May,  |
|                                   | George's sibling is seriously     |
|                                   | injured in a car accident. George |
|                                   | again asks for compassionate      |
|                                   | travel.                           |

|                                   | In August, George's parent dies   |
|                                   | suddenly. George applies for      |
|                                   | compassionate travel to attend    |
|                                   | the funeral.                      |

|                                   |     have already used the limit   |
|                                   |     of 2 compassionate trips and  |
|                                   |     should escalate to DSS to     |
|                                   |     seek approval.                |

|                                   | Alice was granted compassionate   |
|                                   | travel earlier this year and      |
|                                   | claims again to visit a sick      |
|                                   | parent. Compassionate travel is   |
|                                   | granted but Alice is told to      |
|                                   | provide proof of the parent's     |
|                                   | illness to confirm entitlement    |
|                                   | for the claim. Upon return to     |
|                                   | study, Alice provides a medical   |
|                                   | certificate stating Alice's       |
|                                   | parent had the flu and was not    |
|                                   | considered critically ill.        |

|                                   | -   As Alice has not provided     |
|                                   |     proof the parent was          |
|                                   |     critically ill, Alice was not |
|                                   |     eligible for compassionate    |
|                                   |     travel. An overpayment is     |
|                                   |     raised against Alice for the  |
|                                   |     full cost                     |

|                                   | Alice's sibling dies and Alice    |
|                                   | claims compassionate travel to    |
|                                   | attend the funeral.               |

|                                   | -   Compassionate travel is       |
|                                   |     approved. Although Alice was  |
|                                   |     granted compassionate travel  |
|                                   |     twice previously, one of the  |
|                                   |     claims was later rejected.    |
|                                   |     Alice has only had one valid  |
|                                   |     claim this year and so may    |
|                                   |     claim again                   |

|                                   | Angelene received FAA to start    |
|                                   | study. The FAA included travel    |
|                                   | for Angelene’s partner and 2      |
|                                   | children to accompany Angelene    |
|                                   | from her home community in Weipa  |
|                                   | to Brisbane.                      |

|                                   | Shortly after study started,      |
|                                   | Angelene's parent has a heart     |
|                                   | attack and is in hospital in      |
|                                   | Rockhampton in a critical         |
|                                   | condition. Angelene applies for   |
|                                   | compassionate travel from         |
|                                   | Brisbane to Rockhampton.          |

|                                   | Compassionate travel is approved  |
|                                   | for Angelene, their partner and   |
|                                   | children to travel between        |
|                                   | Brisbane and Rockhampton.         |
|                                   | Although compassionate travel is  |
|                                   | usually only available between    |
|                                   | the term address and permanent    |
|                                   | home address, approval can be     |
|                                   | given to start or end a journey   |
|                                   | along the usual route where it is |
|                                   | more convenient or appropriate    |
|                                   | for the traveller/s. In this      |
|                                   | case, Rockhampton is along the    |
|                                   | route between Brisbane and Weipa, |
|                                   | and Brisbane to Rockhampton is a  |
|                                   | less expensive trip. Rockhampton  |
|                                   | is therefore approved as the end  |
|                                   | point of the travel.              |
