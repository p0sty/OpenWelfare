Rent Assistance (RA)

RA is an add-on payment. Customers can only get RA when they receive
another payment. The RA start day for new claims will generally be the
same as the start day for the primary payment. Rent and accommodation
details are recorded on the Accommodation Details (AC) screen.

An A-Z of all Rent Assistance terms and codes is in Rent Assistance
(RA).

RA qualifications

For RA, rent means amounts paid or payable:

-   on a regular basis
-   by the customer, or their partner
-   as a condition of occupying their principal home in Australia

RA is payable to a qualifying customer (or their partner) who:

-   is receiving an income support payment (including Austudy from 1
    January 2008)
-   is receiving more than base rate Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A
-   would receive FTB Part A except that they have care of a Regular
    Care Child
-   is receiving ABSTUDY Schooling B and Tertiary Awards

RA not payable

RA is not payable to customers who:

pay less than the rent threshold according to their family circumstances

pay government rent to a state or territory housing authority. The
exception is defence force housing. View the definition for Government
rent to see a list of the state housing authorities.

Government initiative but it is not government rent. Non-government
organisations own and manage these properties

due to:

-   non-payment of FTB instalment payments to zero entitlement customers
-   prohibition of FTB instalment payments (PIP)
-   RA can be paid with the customer's income support payment if
    non-payment of FTB instalment payments to zero entitlement customer
    applies. See Customers receiving Rent Assistance (RA) with their
    primary payment instead of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)

are in a payment preclusion period

Calculation rate

RA is paid at the rate of 75 cents for every $1 of rent paid over the
rent threshold, up to the maximum RA rate relevant to the customer's
circumstances. That is, subtract the threshold from the rent amount and
multiply by 0.75. Include cents. Round the total up to the nearest cent
and compare with the maximum RA rate.

When a customer pays for board and lodgings, if the amount for lodging
cannot be identified, two-thirds of the total amount is considered to be
for rent.

If the customer shares their accommodation, the rate can be reduced.

Means testing

The income and assets test that applies to the primary payment also
applies to RA.

When RA is paid with an income support payment, the hierarchy of
reductions is applied reducing the basic pension or benefit first under
the means test, then other components including RA.

When a customer has excess income or maintenance income affecting their
rate of FTB Part A, each component (including RA) is reduced
proportionately. For more information, see Apportionment of
income/maintenance reduction for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A.

Rental relief schemes and subsidies

Assistance offered through rent relief schemes can impact on payability
of RA. Generally, RA is payable only on the amount of rent paid or
payable by the RA recipient (and/or their partner) net of any subsidies
or payments from other tenants.

There are a few exceptions to this for specified rental relief schemes
where the RA recipient (and or their partner) will qualify for RA on the
amount of rent nominated on their lease and any subsidy they are
provided is disregarded. However, if part of the rent is covered by
payments from other tenants, these amounts are not disregarded.

See the Process page for more information.

Community housing organisations

Customers paying rent to a community housing organisation are entitled
to RA. For more information about community housing organisations,
search Community housing and OHO in the A-Z of Rent Assistance terms and
codes. Community housing organisations include (but are not limited to):

-   Transitional housing programs - generally short term housing for
    people who are homeless
-   Housing co-operatives
-   Disability housing
-   Aboriginal housing organisations

Note: customers in Victoria who have a lease with the Transitional
Housing Management (THM) program are paying government rent and are not
entitled to receive RA.

Temporary accommodation

RA may be payable, in certain circumstances, to customers who live in
temporary accommodation.

RA reviews

In general, all customers who receive RA may now be selected for a Rent
Assistance (RA) Profile review.

Ineligible homeowner

A homeowner who is not eligible for RA is known as an ineligible
homeowner. Some exemptions apply.
