This document outlines factors to consider when assessing independence
for YA customers.

Independence

A young person's independence affects their eligibility and/or rate of
YA. Young people:

-   aged 22 years or older are considered independent
-   under 22 need to meet 1 of the criteria below to be considered
    independent

Customers not meeting requirements

A young person may consider themselves to be independent because they do
not receive any support from, or have not lived with, a parent or carer
for a period of time.

If a YA customer does not meet the requirements of any of the
independence criteria, they will be assessed as dependent and subject to
the Parental Means Test.

Customers not meeting the Independence criteria may be eligible for the
away from home rate for Youth Allowance (YA) customers.

Criteria for independence

A YA customer is regarded as independent if:

-   they are, or have been married or a member of a YA couple
-   they have, or have had a dependent child
-   they have been self-supporting through full-time paid employment
-   they have been self-supporting through paid employment from a
    regional or remote area (full-time students only)
-   they are
    an orphan
-   they are a refugee. Note: a refugee is only considered independent
    under this criterion where their parents are not in Australia and
    they are not substantially dependent on another person on a long
    term basis
-   they are in State care, provided they are not living with a parent
-   their parents cannot exercise responsibilities
-   they have a partial capacity to work (YA job seeker only)
-   it is unreasonable for the customer to live at home (UTLAH)
-   they are specially disadvantaged with respect to employment
-   they are 22 years of age or older

Specific verification may be required in some cases.

A customer who meets 1 of the above criteria and is 15 years of age can
be paid if they:

-   are also over the minimum school leaving age for the state or
    territory in which they reside, or
-   have a formal exemption from attending school if they are under the
    minimum school leaving age for the state or territory in which they
    reside

Customers under 15 or under the school leaving age may need to be
assessed for Special Benefit (SpB).

Note: customers may have previously established their independence with
a non-reviewable category. This must be taken into account when
assessing YA claims.

Independence when a student has undertaken approved agricultural work

From 1 March 2021, independence when a student has undertaken approved
agricultural work may apply for YA, ABSTUDY or SpB customers where they:

-   have been deemed to have claimed independence under this criterion
    prior to the claiming cut-off date of 2 March 2023
-   earned at least $15,000 gross income from approved agricultural work
    anytime between 30 November 2020 and 31 December 2021
-   were undertaking full-time studies, or an approved concessional
    study load, in an approved course, and
-   had a combined parental income below $160,000, plus $10,000 for each
    additional child included in the Family Unit Regional (FUR), for
    either the 2018/2019 or 2019/2020 tax years

COVID-19 concession period for YA customers

The COVID-19 concession period could apply between 25 March to 24
September 2020 (inclusive) to customers claiming independence under
workforce criteria between 1 January 2021 and 24 September 2022.

Check independence through work history tool

The Check independence through work history online tool is available on
the Services Australia website. It helps customers aged under 22 years
check if they meet the independence criteria based on their work
history.

Verifying employment independence eligibility

In addition to calculating income to verify earnings, a customer may
still be required to supply their payslips within 14 days to verify
their independence claim. Before completing the independence assessment
Service Officers need to verify the customer's evidence of employment.
The customer can post the evidence, upload it online or take it to their
local service centre within 14 days.

When the customer provides evidence, to verify they meet independence by
self-supporting through full-time paid employment, use the Independence
Assessment Tool on the Resources page to calculate verified hours.

The Resources page contains links to the Independence Assessment Tool,
the Services Australia website and relevant forms.
