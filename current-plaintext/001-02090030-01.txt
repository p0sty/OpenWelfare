This document outlines information about job seekers participating in
Skills for Education and Employment (SEE). When a job seeker starts SEE,
participation is documented on their record automatically. Job seekers
may undertake SEE on a part-time basis (10 to 19 hours per week), or a
full-time basis (20-25 hours per week).

Placement in SEE

Job seekers who agree to participate in SEE are referred to an
Employment Services Provider to update their Job Plan.

Centrelink managed job seekers may also participate in SEE. An update to
their Job Plan is not required as the job seeker will already be fully
meeting requirements via another approved activity. SEE participation
alone is not usually enough to meet the criteria to be Centrelink
managed.

From 01 January 2022, job seekers can complete a mainstream VET
qualification up to and including Certificate III or a foundation skills
qualification up to and including Certificate IV level. See:

-   Eligibility for Skills for Education and Employment (SEE), and
-   Referral to Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)

Participation in SEE

Most job seekers are still required to undertake some job search or
another approved activity, while participating in SEE. Part-time or full
time SEE participation may not fully satisfy their mutual obligation
requirements.

Job search activities are not required for SEE participants who are:

-   a principal carer parent, participating for 15 to 19 hours per week
    in SEE
-   a job seeker with a partial capacity to work, when the number of SEE
    hours meets their mutual obligation requirements, or
-   Early School Leavers claiming Youth Allowance (job seeker), who are
    participating in SEE on a full time basis. This meets their mutual
    obligation requirements, when it is recorded by their provider as an
    approved activity in their Job Plan

Provider notifications

SEE program providers:

monitor the participant's attendance, and

take appropriate action to withdraw a participant, where:

-   they are not participating adequately, and
-   are not expected to satisfactorily complete SEE

The provider's notification that a job seeker has been withdrawn:

-   is sent to Services Australia electronically, and
-   updates the job seeker's record automatically
