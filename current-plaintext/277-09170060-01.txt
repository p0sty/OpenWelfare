This document outlines the process for dealing with objection
applications received out of the allowed timeframes. It outlines how a
customer can request an extension of time (EOT) and the circumstances an
extension may be approved. The procedure is for Child Support Objections
Officers at all levels (APS4 – APS6).

Lodging an EOT

A customer can ask for an extension of time to lodge an objection:

-   verbally, or
-   in writing

They can do this when they lodge the objection or after the objection is
made.

EOT for objections to care decisions

Objections to care percentage decisions with date of event on or after 1
July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA ex-nups) are not subject to the extension
of time rules that apply to all other objections. See Creating an
objection record table for information about recording a ‘special
circumstances’ application.

Child Support can determine that special circumstances prevented the
customer from lodging an objection or requesting a review with
Centrelink within the relevant timeframe.

Examples of special circumstances may include that the parent:

-   was seriously ill or had an accident that stopped them from lodging
    an objection
-   suffered a personal trauma such as a death in the family or a
    natural disaster that caused damage to the parent’s property
-   had communication difficulties because of, or including, isolation,
    illiteracy or poor English-language skills
-   reasonably relied upon inaccurate or misleading information
