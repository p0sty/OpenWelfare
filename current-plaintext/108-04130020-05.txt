+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Rental income was only received   |
|                                   | for part of the previous          |
|                                   | financial year                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The income tax return (ITR) shows |
|                                   | how many weeks the property was   |
|                                   | tenanted. If this is not for the  |
|                                   | full year, the income is to be    |
|                                   | adjusted. If the customer advises |
|                                   | of a rental rate that applied     |
|                                   | during or after the period of the |
|                                   | ITR, these details are coded for  |
|                                   | the rental income. If they have   |
|                                   | not advised a new rental rate,    |
|                                   | the rental income shown on the    |
|                                   | ITR must be prorated.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Bill provides the 2019-20 ITR,    |
|                                   | showing the property was only     |
|                                   | occupied for 46 weeks. There were |
|                                   | 6 weeks between tenants in the    |
|                                   | middle of the financial year.     |
|                                   | Bill did not advise a new rate    |
|                                   | when the new tenants moved in, so |
|                                   | for this period assume the rent   |
|                                   | was unchanged.                    |

|                                   | The ITR shows Total Gross Income  |
|                                   | of $7,300.                        |

|                                   | The taxable income will be        |
|                                   | $2,300.                           |

|                                   | ($7,300/46X52).                   |

|                                   | $3,000 and Interest Expense of    |
|                                   | $2,000 are not changed, as these  |
|                                   | are usually constant whether or   |
|                                   | not the property is occupied.     |

|                                   | is $3,252.                        |

|                                   | The same applies when the         |
|                                   | property was purchased less than  |
|                                   | a year ago. A profit and loss     |

|                                   | ITR details do not represent the  |
|                                   | current income. The income and    |
|                                   | expense figures will need to be   |

|                                   | change in rental income that      |
|                                   | occurred before the end of the    |
|                                   | income tax return (ITR) period    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In the above example, had Bill    |
|                                   | advised the new tenants were      |
|                                   | paying rent of $10,200 per annum, |
|                                   | do not use the ITR to change this |
|                                   | figure. However, use the figure   |
|                                   | to update the expenses so the     |
|                                   | assessable income would become    |
|                                   | $5,200 ($10,200 - $5,000).        |
