|                                   | An application for collection     |
|                                   | (AFC) can be made verbally or in  |
|                                   | writing (AFC form) by a payee. If |
|                                   | the payee resides overseas, they  |
|                                   | can lodge an AFC personally or it |
|                                   | can be lodged on their behalf by  |
|                                   | an overseas authority of the      |
|                                   | reciprocating jurisdiction.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: the particulars of an AFC   |
|                                   | can vary until the AFC is         |
|                                   | 'Accepted', that is, processed in |
|                                   | Cuba and letters issued to        |
|                                   | customers. For example, if the    |
|                                   | payee claimed $400 of arrears and |
|                                   | through discussions with both     |
|                                   | parents it was agreed $100 was    |
|                                   | also paid to the payee for child  |
|                                   | support during, or specifically   |
|                                   | for, the claimed opt in arrears   |
|                                   | period, the total claimed arrears |
|                                   | would be adjusted to $300.        |

|                                   | Occasionally a payee may request  |
|                                   | collection of child support for   |

|                                   | payee must be offered the option  |

|                                   | January to 15 February. A future  |
