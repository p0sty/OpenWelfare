QSL targets, payments and enquiries

GP ACAI payments are based on a GP providing a required number of
eligible MBS services in residential aged care facilities (RACF) in a
financial year. There are 4 payment tiers. Note: the maximum payment a
GP can receive in a financial year is $10,000.

Table 1: Qualifying Service Levels (QSL) GP)s must provide in
Commonwealth-funded RACFs in a financial year to be eligible to receive

If a provider enquires about whether they have met a QSL, escalate the
request to Local Peer Support (LPS). Do not ask the provider to send
patient information or supporting documents as evidence of their
eligible payment tier. Program Management will advise if further
information from the practice is required.
