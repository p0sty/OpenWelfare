Council rates notice and Lands Title reference coding examples

-   If the customer has provided a Lands Title reference use this on the
    RE screen. If not, a rates notice may contain details that will help
    with the exact location and identification of the property
-   The information on a council rates notice varies from council to
    council across each state and territory. Not all notices have a
    lands title number or property reference
-   Some rates notices will have a property or valuation number. Do not
    mistake this for the lands title reference number. Generally these
    numbers are an internal number the council assign to the property
    for billing purposes. (TAS and SA are the exception)
