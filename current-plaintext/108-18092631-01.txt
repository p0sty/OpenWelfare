This document explains what code to use in the Verification field after
verification of rent has been received.

Coronavirus (COVID 19) rent verification waiver

From 25 September 2020 onwards, the COVID-19 rent verification waiver
ended. For more information see Determining proof of rent for the
Verification field on the Accommodation Details (AC) screen.

Formal verification

This is when a customer provides a formal rental agreement document for
their accommodation. It may be provided:

to support a new claim for payment that included enough accommodation
details

with a Rent Certificate

after a customer updates accommodation circumstances online and rent
verification code was:

-   UPL - RA Paying - Rent Verification to be uploaded, or
-   RVL - Upload Rent Verification Required

A formal rental agreement is a legally binding written agreement. It is
usually called a Residential Tenancy Agreement (lease), however the name
may vary depending on the state.

If the customer provides a formal rental agreement as part of rent
verification, it must contain:

-   Name of tenant(s) - must include the customer (and/or their current
    partner) claiming RA
-   Premises the agreement relates to - that is, the rental address
-   Name and address of the landlord/managing agent
-   Amount of the rent liability - must include details of any rebated
    amount

A formal rental agreement provided for rent verification does not need
to be signed by the:

-   customer
-   partner
-   landlord/managing agent

This supports the changes to documents managed digitally allowing all
parties to undertake everything in the transaction electronically.

The formal rental agreement is an acceptable form of verification if it
is:

for a fixed time, for example, 12 months, and:

-   still within that period of time, or
-   the fixed period has passed and the agreement has become a
    'continuing' or 'month to month' agreement. The details of the
    continuing agreement will be in a clause in the agreement, or

not for a fixed period

Informal verification

This is when a customer provides one of the following for their current
accommodation:

a signed Rent Certificate (SU523HD) (no other Rent Certificates are
acceptable), or

a signed Rent Declaration (SU336M), along with further documentary proof
of rent paid if possible such as:

-   rent receipts
-   bank deposit slips
-   bank statements

Accept a SU336M when the customer is:

a traveller who moves regularly, or

unable to get their landlord's signature on the SU523HD, for example,
the landlord:

-   cannot be contacted
-   will not sign the SU523HD

Note: electronic/digital signatures are acceptable.

Who can sign the SU523HD landlord or authorised representative declaration

If an acceptable formal rental agreement has not been provided, the
landlord or authorised representative declaration on the SU523HD must be
signed.

The landlord or real estate agent must sign the SU523HD form when the
customer is:

-   a primary tenant (a person named on the lease), or
-   the person who has entered into a verbal rental agreement with a
    landlord

The homeowner, primary tenant or the person who has entered into a
verbal rental agreement with a landlord must sign the form when the
customer:

-   lives with them, and
-   has a rental agreement (generally verbal) with them (that is,
    customer pays them board and/or lodging)

State government authorities or private legal firms (for example,
trustees) who manage a customer's business with Services Australia
cannot sign the SU523HD as the landlord or authorised representative.

Customer with a home based business

A customer must provide specific verification documents if:

-   they run a business from their home
-   the formal rental agreement is in the business name, and
-   they pay rent to the business for private use

Documents to verify rent must include all of the following:

a copy of the formal rental agreement document(s)

a copy of the business tax return or profit and loss statement, and

either:

-   a Rent Certificate (SU523HD) (no other Rent Certificates are
    acceptable) signed by a business partner as the landlord. This is as
    long as this person is not the customer or their partner, or
-   a Rent Declaration (SU336M), as the customer (including their
    partner) cannot sign their own SU523HD

If the formal rental agreement is in the customer's name, confirmation
of the amount claimed as a business expense is needed. This is to
determine the amount of rent assessable for calculation of RA. Documents
to verify rent must include:

-   the business tax return, or
-   a profit and loss statement
