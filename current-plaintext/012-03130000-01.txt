This document outlines the new evidence of identity (EOI) documentation
required for both individual and site Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
applications including the selections to make from the eHealth Program
(EHP) system when a primary and secondary document is received.

Evidence of identity (EOI)

New EOI documentation is required for both individual and site PKI
applications. Which means that EOI and the processing of EOI for HI
Service has changed (see Process page).

For an individual application if the applicant is not a known customer
to Services Australia, they will need to supply one certified document
from the primary list and one certified document from the secondary
list.

The new requirements for EOI are effective from 28 November 2016. See
Apply for Public Key Infrastructure list for new EOI.

Receiving two primary or two secondary documents

There are some documents in the recent Gatekeeper Framework changes that
have moved from Primary to Secondary, and from Secondary to Primary (for
example, Drivers Licence has moved from Secondary to Primary).

If the applicant provides either two primary or two secondary documents
with the application as a result of the Gatekeeper changes, escalate to
the HI Service Enquiry Line.

The Resources page contains a link to contact details.
