Unreasonable estimated property values

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Parmesh has a 2 bedroom unit in   |
|                                   | an outer suburb. On the new       |
|                                   | claim, the estimated property     |
|                                   | value has been provided as        |
|                                   | $45,000. It is likely that this   |
|                                   | was a typing error and perhaps    |
|                                   | meant to be $450,000.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is considered unreasonable   |
|                                   | and a valuation should be         |
|                                   | requested before granting the     |
|                                   | claim.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2                                 | Mackenzie has provided an         |

|                                   | $350,000. The rates notice also   |
|                                   | provided shows that the local     |
|                                   | council are assessing a land      |
|                                   | value of $325,000. Based on the   |
|                                   | rates notice amount, it is likely |
|                                   | the whole property may be worth   |
|                                   | more than the estimate provided.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is considered unreasonable   |
|                                   | and a valuation should be         |
|                                   | requested before granting the     |
|                                   | claim.                            |

|                                   | It is unlikely the 48 hectares of |

|                                   | in a rural town. Wendy has        |
|                                   | provided an estimated value of    |
|                                   | $25,000 for the block. Wendy also |

|                                   | increase the block’s value enough |
