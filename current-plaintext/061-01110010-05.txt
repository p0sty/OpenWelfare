Examples of unsatisfactory reasons for granting portability for restricted payments

may still travel, but they will not receive any payment based on any of
the following conditions.

| 1                                 | Herbal treatment                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Customers may seek to travel      |
|                                   | overseas to receive intensive     |
|                                   | herbal treatment. Current policy  |
|                                   | is that herbal treatments do not  |
|                                   | allow payment to continue even    |
|                                   | where the customer's doctor has   |
|                                   | recommended the treatment and it  |
|                                   | is not available in Australia.    |

| 2                                 | Travel outside Australia to rest  |
|                                   | and be with family                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is common for a customer's     |
|                                   | doctor or psychiatrist to         |
|                                   | recommend rest and/or time with   |
|                                   | family and friends as a treatment |
|                                   | for some conditions. While this   |
|                                   | may be beneficial, current policy |
|                                   | is that this is not an acceptable |
|                                   | reason under the eligible medical |
|                                   | treatment criteria as it is not   |
|                                   | medical treatment.                |

|                                   | Ayurvedic treatment is a system   |
|                                   | of traditional medicine native to |
|                                   | the Indian subcontinent and       |

|                                   | is mainly available as a          |
|                                   | complementary and alternative     |
|                                   | medicine. Treatment may be, but   |
|                                   | is not limited to, dietary        |
|                                   | recommendations, massage, yoga,   |
|                                   | herbal treatments.                |

|                                   | however the traditional intensive |
|                                   | treatment is mainly available in  |
|                                   | India.                            |

|                                   | Current policy is that Ayurvedic  |
|                                   | treatment outside Australia is    |
|                                   | not an eligible medical           |
|                                   | treatment.                        |

|                                   | customer in their native language |

|                                   | skills. There are a number of     |

|                                   | Australia who have language       |

|                                   | Some customers wish to travel and |
|                                   | have the support of their doctor  |
|                                   | to do so, where the climate is    |
|                                   | believed to help with their       |
|                                   | condition. In some cases, it may  |
|                                   | be recommended that warmer        |
|                                   | weather will help alleviate       |
|                                   | symptoms and customers wish to    |
|                                   | leave Australia’s winter. Current |
|                                   | policy is that travelling for a   |
|                                   | better climate is not an eligible |
|                                   | medical treatment.                |

|                                   | policy is that, generally,        |
|                                   | travelling for treatment overseas |
|                                   | would not be approved, as it      |
|                                   | would not meet the requirement to |
|                                   | be travelling for medical         |

|                                   | As medical research develops this |
|                                   | situation may change, so any      |
|                                   | assessment must consider all      |
|                                   | available information and refer   |
|                                   | to the Health Professional        |

|                                   | Often customers wish to travel    |
|                                   | overseas as they can get          |
|                                   | treatment more quickly/cheaply    |
|                                   | than in Australia where they may  |
|                                   | be on a waiting list. Current     |
|                                   | policy is that this reason does   |
