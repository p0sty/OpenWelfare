|                                   | Where the job seeker has a        |
|                                   | current exemption which ends more |
|                                   | than 3 days in the future there   |
|                                   | is no requirement to select an    |
|                                   | appointment based on availability |
|                                   | as the appointment is always      |
|                                   | going to be after 3 days in the   |
|                                   | future. This option should only   |
|                                   | be used where the exemption ends  |
|                                   | between 3 days' time and 6 weeks  |
|                                   | in the future and a referral is   |
|                                   | needed. An appointment should be  |
|                                   | selected for exemption end date   |
|                                   | plus one day unless the Service   |
|                                   | Officer thinks the exemption is   |
|                                   | likely to be extended. The        |
|                                   | Exemption End date is transmitted |
|                                   | to the Department of Employment   |
|                                   | and Workplace Relations.          |

|                                   | still applies. Customer choice    |
|                                   | may be governed by factors such   |
|                                   | as personal preferences.          |

|                                   | advised that selecting a later    |
|                                   | appointment may delay their       |

|                                   | appointment needs to be more than |
|                                   | 3 days in the future, because the |
|                                   | interpreter must be arranged by   |
|                                   | Workforce Australia. Ensure an    |
|                                   | interpreter flag is recorded in   |
