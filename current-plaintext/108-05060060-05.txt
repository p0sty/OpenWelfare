|                                   | In this example, the              |
|                                   | superannuation offset is $611.32. |
|                                   | At 60%, this offset was generated |
|                                   | from $1,018.86 per week           |
|                                   | superannuation. $611.32 x10 / 6 = |

|                                   | However in this example, $611.32  |
|                                   | was not required to reduce the    |
|                                   | SRDP payment to nil. After        |

|                                   | $237.82), only $483.78 was used   |
|                                   | to offset the SRDP to 0.00. Which |
|                                   | at 60%, required only $806.30 per |
|                                   | week of the superannuation. i.e.  |
|                                   | ($483.78 x 10/6 = $806.30).       |

|                                   | back to fortnightly.              |
