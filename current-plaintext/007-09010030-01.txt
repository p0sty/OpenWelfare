PPL details for customers with children born or entering care both
before and on or after 1 July 2023.

This document explains the responsibilities of employers for the
delivery of Parental Leave Pay (PPL).

Employer role in PPL

It is mandatory for employers to provide PPL to their eligible
employees.

Employers are required to deliver PPL:

for children born or adopted before 1 July 2023, the PPL period, plus
any Flexible PPL days that are connected to it

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023, where the customer
has nominated in their claim:

-   a continuous pattern of at least 8 weeks that falls before the
    child’s first birth date/anniversary of care, and
-   The pattern consists of 5 PPL days per week for every weekday (i.e.
    Monday to Friday only and does not include weekends)

If the customer is not an eligible employee, or if PPL cannot be
delivered by the employer, for example, if the employer is not required
to have an Australian Business Number (ABN) it will be delivered by
Services Australia.

PPL claims where the customer receives an income support payment

If the employee is receiving an income support payment (ISP) at the time
of the initial PPL claim determination (including where the ISP will
cancel due to PPL payments) Services Australia will be the default PPL
paymaster. No employer determination will be made.

Employees already in receipt of PPL who have had an employer
determination made (either the PPL payment has commenced or has been
scheduled to commence) and who are granted an ISP will have the
paymaster role automatically transferred from the employer to the
agency. The date of effect for the transfer will be the PPL date paid
to + 1 day to ensure there is no overpayment raised against the
employer.

Once the agency is appointed as the paymaster, future reassessments will
not change the paymaster role, unless:

-   the employee makes a subsequent request to change the paymaster
    role, and
-   the employee is no longer receiving an ISP

This automatic paymaster role transfer does not apply where an ISP is
granted to the PPL customer's partner. It only applies if the PPL
customer themselves are granted an ISP.

PPL funds

Services Australia will provide PPL funds to the employer who will
provide PPL to the employee through their existing payroll cycle.

PPL days

For children that were born or entered care on or after 1 July 2020 and
before 1 July 2023:

PPL will include up to 30 Flexible PPL days

Employers will only be responsible for delivering any Flexible PPL day
that is:

-   connected to the PPL period, and
-   scheduled on a day that is before the child’s first
    birthday/anniversary of entry into care

If there is a break in eligibility during the PPL period or connected
Flexible PPL days:

-   the employer role will cease, and
-   any remaining Flexible PPL days will be delivered by Services
    Australia

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023, employers will
provide PPL where:

-   the customer nominates an 8 week (40 consecutive weekdays) minimum
    block of continuous PPL days (Monday to Friday only), that falls
    before the child turns one/anniversary of care. Note: the continuous
    period can start on any week day
-   the block of PPL days are the customers first paid PPL days since
    birth/entry to care

Any subsequent PPL days, (including periods of 8 weeks or longer)
separated from the first period, will be paid by Services Australia.

Note: where an employer determination has been made for a pre-birth PPL
claim and customer adds one or more days before the employer paid period
before PPL becomes current:

-   ,the initial employer paid period will continue to be paid by the
    employer, and
-   the new days will be paid by Services Australia

The employer determination will be revoked if the customer:

-   removes a day from the continuous period to create a gap (including
    where they are ineligible on a day), or
-   adds a weekend day during the continuous period

Employer responsibilities

The employer must undertake the following:

-   provide details to advance the employer PPL funding amounts
-   withhold tax from the PPL under the usual PAYG withholding
    arrangements and include PPL in the total amounts on the employee's
    annual or part-year payment summary (statements produced and given
    to the employee for tax purposes)
-   provide the employee with access to a record of their PPL by
    providing payslips
-   keep written financial records of the receipt of PPL funds received
    from the agency and the PPL provided to an employee
-   notify their employee and employer change in circumstances

The Resources page has a table of processes for revoking employer
determination or transferring the provider role to the agency, suggested
text for use in letters seeking additional information from employees,
contact details for the Paid Parental Leave Employer Processing Team
(PPLEPT), and a link to contact details for the New Parent Programmes
Team.
