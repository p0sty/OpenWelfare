|                                   | garnishee, due to being           |

|                                   |     medical/hospital coverage     |
|                                   | -   has an 8 year old child with  |
|                                   |     a critical medical condition  |
|                                   |     which has just been diagnosed |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In this case, a decision to       |
|                                   | refund part or all of the         |
|                                   | garnishee amount could occur.     |
|                                   | This is because of the child's    |
|                                   | health problem, and the           |
|                                   | associated costs. This is an      |
|                                   | unforeseen and exceptional        |
|                                   | circumstance. The customer's      |
|                                   | financial situation on its own    |
|                                   | would not be grounds for          |
|                                   | refunding the garnishee amount.   |
