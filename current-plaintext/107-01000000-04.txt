Agreements and arrangements

Services Australia relationships with other government departments are
bound by a high-level multilateral strategic partnership document. There
are several detailed Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA), each
between the agency and individual departments.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services to be provided by Services Australia
and conditions applying to their provision. They improve assurance and
provide greater transparency of the agency's performance in meeting:

-   service delivery outcomes
-   risk management and
-   accuracy targets

See Department of Social Services (DSS) Relationship Team.
