| 1                                 | Question: Will FTB Part B         |
|                                   | automatically stop when PPL       |

|                                   | Answer: The FTB system will read  |
|                                   | the PPL payment dates and apply   |
|                                   | the appropriate rules - FTB Part  |
|                                   | B cannot be paid on any days that |
|                                   | the customer gets PPL.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a pre-birth/adoption PPL claim |
|                                   | is assessed pending proof of      |
|                                   | birth/entry into care, FTB Part B |
|                                   | will cease from the expected date |
|                                   | of birth/entry into care to       |
|                                   | reduce possible risk of           |
|                                   | overpayment. Once proof of birth  |
|                                   | is provided, any adjustments to   |
|                                   | FTB Part B are made within the    |
|                                   | PPL claim assessment and any Part |
|                                   | B debt is raised as a             |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | FTB quarantine coding will be     |
|                                   | separate to PPL. Therefore staff  |
|                                   | will need to code a return to     |
|                                   | work for both PPL and FTB Part B  |
|                                   | using separate workflows.         |
