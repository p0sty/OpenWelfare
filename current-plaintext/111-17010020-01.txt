This document outlines the storage requirements for documents scanned to
a customer record.

Documents for new claims

Documents from a customer or third party may be received with a
claim/reclaim or as a separate document. They may confirm a customer's
entitlement or notify a change of circumstances.

Unless a scannable document exception exists, all documents that need to
be processed at another location should be scanned where they are
received.

If processing documents at first point of contact, staff must use the
relevant Operational Blueprint for that transaction to determine if
documents should be scanned to a customer's record using the 'Scan to
Store' function on the Multi-Function Device (MFD). This prevents
unnecessary work item creation.

Documents should be scanned on the same day they are received. If this
is not possible (for example, due to a scanning contingency), the date
of receipt on the MFD should be changed.

Scanned documents

Any documents scanned at a service centre should be:

-   placed in a scan batch on site, and
-   destroyed with the batch header on site in the secure waste
    container, 70 calendar days after being scanned

The Resources page contains a link to the Batch Header Sheet.
