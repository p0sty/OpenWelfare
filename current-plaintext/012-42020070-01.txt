Eligibility

The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) recommended that this
procedure be restricted to cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons
who:

-   have undergone specialist training in the procedure
-   participate in an audit program administered by the Cardiac Society
    of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)

The Lead Extraction Advisory Committee of the CSANZ assesses eligibility
for the recognition of training in this procedure and advises Services
Australia via email of eligible specialists.

The specialist's Medicare provider number details are updated to show
eligibility and the effective start date specified by the Committee.

Services Australia notifies the medical practitioner to advise that the
Committee notice has been received and their provider number details
have been updated to record eligibility and the effective date.

Access to Medicare benefits

Eligibility enables payment of Medicare benefits for the Medicare
Benefits Schedule (MBS) item for the extraction of pacing leads. Further
information about the item and rules can be found in the Medicare
Benefits Schedule. See the Resources page for a link to MBS Online.

Payment of Medicare benefits is also subject to the medical practitioner
being registered with the Medical Board of Australia and satisfying any
other legislative provisions that may apply at the date of service.
