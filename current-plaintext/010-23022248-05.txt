Transfer of excess SFA (Group 2)

Secondary school student's total annual entitlement is a combination of
Living Allowance, Rent Assistance and Remote Area Allowance. If the
total amount is insufficient to meet the board charge of the school or
hostel, any excess SFA (Group 2), up to the maximum available, is
transferred across to top-up the shortfall.

Terminology and formula used

Table 1: This table describes the terminology and formula used by the
system from the coding on the School Fees and Boarding Details (EYSB)
screen to calculate a top-up from the SFA (Group 2) for payment to cover
the shortfall in boarding expenses

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

TSFA minus SFC = available excess of SFA (Group 2)

BC minus TBE = shortfall in boarding entitlements

Top-up = the lower of the available excess SFA (Group 2) and the
shortfall in boarding entitlements.

Scenarios - Excess SFA (Group 2) and available top-up calculations

Table 2: This table provides scenarios where an excess SFA (Group 2) is
calculated for the shortfall in boarding entitlements
