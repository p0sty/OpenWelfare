This document outlines how to identify and determine the amount of
income and assets to consider when assessing private companies and
private trusts. It also looks at the issues that should be considered in
relation to income support payments and concessions. On 1 January 2002,
the way private companies and private trusts are treated under the
Income and Assets Tests changed.

Special Disability Trust rules

Different rules apply to an approved Special Disability Trust (SDT). An
SDT's income is exempt from the income test. The SDT's assets are exempt
from the Assets Test as long as the assets are not over the concessional
asset limit. A separate procedure covers SDTs.

Rules for the treatment of private companies and trusts

The rules changed to align the social security Assets Test treatment of
customers who hold assets in private trusts and private companies with
that of individuals who hold similar levels of assets personally, or via
public companies or in fixed trusts.

This means that where a customer controls or has contributed to a
private company or private trust, the income and assets of that entity
may be taken into account (attributed to the customer) when assessing
entitlement to income support payments and concessions. Overseas
companies not registered under Australian corporations law may still be
assessed under trust and company rules if they are considered to be
designated and controlled private companies.

These rules have no effect on customers who only own shares in public
companies or units in publicly listed trusts. Nor do they affect
complying superannuation funds (including do it yourself (DIY) funds) or
most court-ordered statutory trusts. The assets owned by sole trader and
partnership businesses are already assessable for customers who own or
have an interest in these businesses

Attribution decisions are made by the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO)
based on information provided on the Private Trust MOD PT or Private
Company MOD PC and accompanying documents. Refer all assessments of a
private company or private trust to a Complex Assessment Officer (CAO).
