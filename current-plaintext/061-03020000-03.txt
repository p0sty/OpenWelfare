|                                   | A concession card will generally  |
|                                   | remain current for up to 6 weeks  |
|                                   | if a customer temporarily leaves  |
|                                   | Australia. If the concession card |
|                                   | is still current, a new card does |
|                                   | not need to be reissued.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer has lost          |
|                                   | entitlement to their card because |
|                                   | they have been absent for more    |
|                                   | than their maximum portability    |
|                                   | period for the card, but payment  |
|                                   | is restored when they return to   |
|                                   | Australia, any concession card    |
|                                   | associated with the payment will  |
|                                   | be automatically reinstated. For  |
|                                   | example, if PPS entitlement is    |
|                                   | lost but then regained within 13  |
|                                   | weeks of suspension, the PCC is   |
|                                   | reinstated automatically. A new   |
|                                   | PCC will not be issued unless it  |
|                                   | reached its expiry date while the |
|                                   | customer was overseas. If the     |
|                                   | customer requires a concession    |
|                                   | card before the replacement card  |
|                                   | arrives, they should contact      |
|                                   | their nearest Centrelink Service  |

|                                   | If the customer is the holder of  |
|                                   | a non-income tested PCC the card  |
|                                   | will automatically reissue if the |
|                                   | customer returns to Australia     |
|                                   | within 13 weeks of cancellation.  |
|                                   | If the return is outside the 13   |
|                                   | weeks of cancellation the card    |
|                                   | has to be reissued manually.      |
