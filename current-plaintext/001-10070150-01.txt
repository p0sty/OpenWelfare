This document outlines the policy and procedures that apply when a job
seeker fails to attend or does not satisfactorily participate in a
compulsory appointment notified by their Employment Services Provider or
ParentsNext provider.

Requirement to attend and satisfactorily participate in compulsory provider managed appointments

Job seekers, including ParentsNext participants, receiving a
participation payment are expected to attend and participate in
compulsory appointments arranged by their provider.

This expectation applies to both provider appointments and third party
appointments arranged by the provider.

The provider has responsibility for ensuring the job seeker receives
proper notification and reasonable notice of compulsory appointments.

Attending a compulsory appointment includes the following requirements:

-   be punctual for the appointment and remain until the completion of
    the appointment
-   satisfactorily participate during the appointment

When a job seeker fails to attend a compulsory appointment or act in an
appropriate manner while at a compulsory appointment, this is managed
using the relevant job seeker compliance system.

Prior contact

Job seekers who are unable to attend an appointment are required to
notify their provider, wherever possible, why they are unable to attend
prior to the scheduled appointment start time.

When the job seeker fails to comply with the requirement to make prior
contact, a financial penalty may apply even if the job seeker had a
reasonable excuse for their non-attendance.

Inappropriate conduct while attending an appointment

Job seekers are required to behave in an appropriate manner while
attending an appointment. When inappropriate behaviour occurs while
attending an appointment, this is managed using the relevant job seeker
compliance system.

Behaving inappropriately means failing to behave in accordance with the
standards that would be commonly expected. This includes, but is not
limited to:

-   not following reasonable instructions
-   being disruptive or uncooperative
-   behaving in a manner that is aggressive, violent or offensive
-   harassing other people on the premises
-   behaving in a manner that causes risk to the health and safety of
    themselves or others
-   being intoxicated or consuming intoxicants during the appointment

Generally, this type of behaviour is only considered inappropriate when
serious in nature, deliberate and within the job seeker's control.

When a provider reports inappropriate conduct, and Services Australia
establish during a compliance investigation that the behaviour was not
in the job seeker's control, free text is sent to the provider to ensure
this can be considered for future servicing.

Managing non-compliance for job seekers - Targeted Compliance Framework

Under the Targeted Compliance Framework, when a job seeker fails to
attend, is not punctual or behaves inappropriately at a compulsory
appointment, a mutual obligation failure has been committed.

When a job seeker has been notified that they are required to record
their attendance at a third party appointment and does not do so, a
mutual obligation failure has been committed.

When providers report that a mutual obligation failure has been
committed, the job seeker's participation payments may be suspended.
Where payment is suspended, Services Australia will lift the payment
suspension when the provider electronically notifies that the conditions
for lifting the suspension have been met. Participation payments are
cancelled if the reconnection requirement is not met within four weeks.

Job seekers in the warning zone will accrue a demerit if the provider:

-   is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason for failing to
    attend, and
-   is not satisfied the job seeker has a valid reason for not making
    prior contact, or
-   determines that misconduct has occurred and the behaviour was within
    the job seeker's control

Job seekers in the financial penalty zone will incur a financial penalty
unless:

their provider closes the Non-Compliance Report on contact with the job
seeker to discuss their non-attendance because they are satisfied the
job seeker has a valid reason, or

the job seeker satisfies Services Australia during a compliance
investigation that:

-   they had reasonable excuse for failing to attend and for failing to
    make prior contact, or
-   the inappropriate behaviour was not within their control

Managing non-compliance for CDP participants - Job Seeker Compliance Framework

Under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework, non-attendance at an
appointment arranged with or by a Community Development Program (CDP)
provider is managed in various ways. The action taken is based on agreed
processes, policy, and legislation for each type of appointment.

Appointment is with the CDP provider

When a CDP participant does not attend an appointment with their CDP
provider, or contact prior to explain why they are unable to attend,
their provider may submit:

-   a Non-Attendance Report (NAR), or
-   a NAR and a Provider Appointment Report (PAR)

A valid NAR will result in the suspension of the CDP participant's
payment 'Non-attendance report received' (ANR). Payment will remain
suspended until the CDP participant:

-   attends a re-engagement appointment, or
-   the provider determines the CDP participant is not required to
    re-engage

A valid PAR will result in a compliance failure for investigation by
Services Australia. The type of failure generated from a PAR will depend
on the type of appointment the CDP participant did not attend:

-   failure to attend a 'regular' appointment will result in a
    non-attendance failure
-   failure to attend an appointment that was a reconnection requirement
    will result in a reconnection failure

Appointment is with a third party

Under the CDP Job Seeker Compliance Framework, a provider may choose to
manage failure to attend a compulsory appointment they have arranged for
a CDP participant with a third party by submitting a Participation
Report to Services Australia.

Upon receipt of the Participation Report:

-   a connection failure will be generated, and
-   the CDP participant will be sent a notification advising them to
    contact the Participation Solutions Team (PST) as soon as possible
    to discuss the non-compliance event

A PST-skilled Service Officer will investigate the compliance action and
if the CDP participant does not provide a reasonable excuse for failing
to attend a third party appointment, a connection failure will be
applied.
