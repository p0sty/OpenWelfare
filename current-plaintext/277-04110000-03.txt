|                                   | Before processing any debt offset |
|                                   | all assessments and the debt must |
|                                   | be correct. Ensure that:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   there are no outstanding      |
|                                   |     NAPs, see Non Agency Payments |
|                                   |     (NAPs) (CS)). If there is a   |
|                                   |     prescribed NAP credit the     |
|                                   |     offset must be carefully      |
|                                   |     considered so that neither    |
|                                   |     customer is disadvantaged. A  |
|                                   |     debt offset is treated as a   |
|                                   |     payment collected and paid to |
|                                   |     the payee for the purpose of  |
|                                   |     prescribed NAPs - and allows  |
|                                   |     a prescribed NAP credit to be |
|                                   |     applied if the other          |
|                                   |     prescribed NAP rules are met  |

|                                   | possible. Debt offset may also be |
|                                   | raised when speaking to the       |
|                                   | customer about other issues.      |

|                                   | will be calculated as if they     |

|                                   | cash. It is important to advise   |
|                                   | customers in receipt of FTB that  |

|                                   | be appropriate to negotiate an    |
|                                   | offset percentage which allows a  |
|                                   | portion of the ongoing liability  |

|                                   | reducing the maintenance debt.    |

|                                   | payer must be advised the         |

|                                   | arrangement at any time. A new    |
|                                   | decision may be made by the       |
