This document explains the process to obtain a Tax File Number (TFN)
from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for a newly arrived refugee
customer. The process differs depending on whether a refugee customer is
claiming an income support payment (ISP) or family tax benefit (FTB).

TFN and new claims

Customers who live in Australia and their partners must give a valid TFN
to get a Centrelink payment.

An exemption from providing TFN may be granted in limited circumstances.

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is not payable without a TFN. This requirement
impacts newly arrived refugees and can cause delays in their access to
FTB payments and services.

In limited circumstances a customer may be exempted from providing their
partner's TFN details.
See Provision of Tax File Number for family assistance and Paid Parental
Leave scheme payments.

Privacy requirements

To ensure this process meets privacy and other requirements of both
agencies, a TFN application must be lodged online in the name of the
customer through the ATO Online Individual Auto Registration (IAR) tool.
If the customer has a Department of Home Affairs issued ImmiCard, see
Process for coding information.
