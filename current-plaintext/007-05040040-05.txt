|                                   | provision simply ensures that an  |

|                                   | for PPL will remain open, as they |

|                                   | 'keeping in touch' if they        |
|                                   | participate in paid work for the  |
|                                   | purpose of assisting their return |

|                                   | If an employee 'returns to work'  |
|                                   | before the end of their PPL       |
|                                   | period their PPL will stop from   |
|                                   | that day.                         |

|                                   | Once the employee has returned to |
|                                   | work they cannot access ‘keeping  |
|                                   | in touch days’, even if they have |
|                                   | not used all 10 days.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | How does an employee access a     |
|                                   | 'keeping in touch' day?           |

|                                   | It is important to note there is  |
|                                   | no requirement for either an      |

|                                   | to a 'keeping in touch' day.      |
