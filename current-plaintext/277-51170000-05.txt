|                                   | received) MFU on their record for |
|                                   | an FTB child. MFU details show    |
|                                   | DOV 1 October 2020 86% care and   |
|                                   | the greater than 100% care (>100) |

|                                   | Checking the CHC and FSC screens  |
|                                   | show In Customer Care with 100%   |

|                                   | 2020 from the MFU matched the     |
|                                   | date the customer separated. The  |
|                                   | MS screen shows that the customer |
