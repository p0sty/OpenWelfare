This page outlines the process of reconciliation that determines a
customer's correct Child Care Benefit (CCB) entitlement for the relevant
financial year based on the customer’s circumstances. The system
displays CCB for approved care as the term CCF (Child Care Formal).

Results of approved CCF reconciliation or lump sum claims should not be
discussed with the child care service. Advise the service to ask the
customer to contact Services Australia.
