This document outlines customer options for voluntary participation
while a principal carer of a dependent child. These customers may choose
to participate in activities which may assist their return to the paid
workforce.

Principal carers mutual obligation requirements

Some customers who are the principal carer of a dependent child will
have part-time mutual obligation requirements once their youngest child
reaches a certain age. This age depends on the type of payment received
by the customer:

-   Parenting Payment Single (PPS) principal carers whose youngest child
    is aged 6 and younger than 14
-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA) job seeker principal
    carers have part time mutual obligation requirements from the start
    date of their payment, and their youngest child must be under the
    age of 16
-   Special Benefit (SpB) under JSP conditions principal carers whose
    youngest child is aged 6 or older

Note: for PP and SpB customers, the customer can participate voluntarily
if they wish while their youngest child is below this age.

Loss of PP qualification due to age of child

Partnered customers whose youngest child is aged 6 or more and single
customers whose youngest child is aged 14 or more are no longer eligible
to receive PP and must claim either JSP or YA (job seeker) as a
principal carer of a dependent child.

Voluntary participation

Customers who do not have mutual obligation requirements may choose to
volunteer to participate in employment services.

For some activities, the customer may also be eligible for Additional
Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) (Transition to Work).
