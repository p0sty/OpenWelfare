Cancel Review reasons

This table explains each Cancel Review Reason to help identify the
correct code to use. Use the most appropriate reason. For example, it is
not appropriate to use CMB (Combined) when the review is not being
combined with another review.

The Cancel Review Reason applied to Service Updates and Host Reviews is
the Cancel Review Reason passed by the Service Profiling or Host System.
If no Cancel Review Reason is passed, IRS will apply NRP (No Reason
Provided). This cannot be manually applied to any Service Update or
Review.
