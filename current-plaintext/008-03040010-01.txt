This document explains the assessment of Continuing Inability to Work
(CITW) for customers claiming or granted Disability Support Pension
(DSP) on or after 1 July 2006.

Determining qualification for DSP

Assessing CITW helps determine if the customer is medically qualified
for DSP.

To qualify for DSP, a person must have:

-   a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 points or
    more under the Impairment Tables, and
-   a CITW and for some people the assessment of a CITW also includes
    meeting Program of Support (POS) requirements

The assessment of an impairment rating and CITW are 2 separate
assessments based on different criteria. They are of equal importance
when determining eligibility for DSP.

Assessing where CITW occurred (for residence)

The assessment of CITW and determining ‘where the customer's CITW
occurred’ are separate.

To determine if the customer satisfies the residency requirements, the
assessment of where the customer's CITW occurred is required if the
customer does not have:

-   10 years qualifying Australian residence, or
-   A qualifying residence exemption (QRE)

The assessment of where the customer's CITW occurred is made by
Assessment Services. The process is included in Streaming a new claim
for Disability Support Pension (DSP).

When an assessment of CITW is not required

An assessment of CITW is not required if the customer is:

-   participating in the Supported Wage System (SWS), or
-   meets medical manifest eligibility for DSP

Note: the assessment of where CITW occurred for residence purposes may
still be required.

CITW criteria

A customer has a CITW if their impairment alone prevents them from
undertaking both of the following:

-   work for 15 or more hours per week where wages are at or above the
    relevant minimum wage, for at least 2 years
-   educational, pre-vocational, vocational, or work related training
    (including on-the job training) is unlikely (because of the
    customer's impairment) to allow the customer to do any work for 15
    or more hours per week where wages are at or above the relevant
    minimum wage, within 2 years independently of a POS

A DSP Grandfathered recipient meets CITW criteria because of an
impairment if they have an inability to:

-   undertake work of 30 hours or more per week within the next 2 years
-   undertake educational, vocational or on-the-job training to prepare
    for work within the next 2 years, or
-   such training is unlikely, because of their impairment/s, to allow
    the customer to work for 30 hours or more per week within the next 2
    years

Program of Support (POS)

A customer must have actively participated in a POS to meet CITW
requirements when claiming DSP from 3 September 2011 who:

-   is not manifestly eligible, or
-   does not have a severe impairment

Satisfying POS

A customer is considered to have met POS if they have participated in a
POS in the 3 years before their DSP claim. They must have complied with
the requirements of the program, and:

-   participated in the program for at least 18 months (78 weeks)
-   completed a program that was less than 18 months
-   the program was terminated because the customer was unable, solely
    because of their impairment, to improve their work capacity through
    continued participation in that program, or
-   they are still participating in the program but solely because of
    their impairment cannot improve their work capacity through
    continued participation in that program

Assessment process

A JCA assesses the impact of the customer's medical conditions on their
abililty to work. Where required, the JCA considers if the customer has
actively participated in a Program of Support. The Assessor's
recommendations help determines if the customer has a CITW.

The customer's ability to perform their usual work or work for which
they are currently skilled is assessed initially. If this indicates an
inability to work, the possibility of undertaking a training activity to
perform any type of work within the next 2 years is then considered.

Other factors in determining CITW

Other factors affecting CITW to consider include:

physical and intellectual characteristics required to perform the work

the customer's ability to demonstrate those characteristics, both
current, and within the next 2 years

the ability to:

-   regularly report to work
-   persist at work tasks
-   understand and follow work instructions
-   communicate with others in the workplace
-   travel to/from work, and move around at work
-   attend to their personal care needs in the workplace
-   manipulate objects at work
-   exhibit appropriate work behaviour
-   undertake a variety of tasks and to alternate between tasks
-   lift, carry and move objects at work

if a customer requires a moderate to high level of ongoing assistance to
maintain the employment

the impact of a customer's impairment on their ability to do training
activities. This includes mainstream training programs and programs
designed specifically for people with physical, intellectual or
psychiatric impairments

if training is likely to allow the customer to do any work within the
next 2 years

if attendance at medical appointments/treatments interferes with their
ability to work

if the customer is fit for any work, either skilled or unskilled,
without needing preparatory training, other than on-the-job training.
This may involve consideration of:

-   the customer's work history
-   the customer's level and type of education and training history
-   work which would be suited to the customer's work skills

Factors not considered in determining CITW

The following factors are not considered in the assessment:

-   the availability of the customer's usual work in the locally
    accessible labour market
-   the availability of any work the customer could do or be trained
    for, within the locally accessible labour market
-   the availability to the customer of a training activity that would
    help in developing work skills
-   the availability to the customer of any kind of transport (public or
    private) to travel to and from work
-   the customer's motivation to work, except when medical evidence
    indicates the lack of motivation is direct result of the impairment
-   difficulties with literacy, numeracy or language which are not
    directly due to a medical condition
-   the customer's preferences regarding the type of work or training
-   the customer's potential attractiveness to an employer in a
    particular area of work
-   employer preferences and discriminatory practices that exist in the
    open labour market

Training activities

When assessing CITW, the possibility of undertaking training must be
considered. Training for the purposes of these provisions include:

All mainstream training (that is, programs not restricted to people with
disabilities), for example TAFE courses. This includes programs that
accommodate people with disabilities through the provision of aids such
as;

-   audio recorders
-   monitors
-   other equipment or environmental modifications, or
-   make concessions such as allowing unscheduled breaks or allowing the
    course to be completed at participant's own pace

Training which is designed specifically for people with impairments,
that is, where it is a prerequisite for acceptance into the course that
the customer has a disability

Training programs that provide additional assistance to people as part
of the program, solely because of their medical impairments, for example
Disability Employment Services (DES)

Mainstream labour market programs. An understanding of the educational
and vocational training available is essential

The concept of training extends to the types of work in which the
customer has potential to perform.

If the customer cannot participate in such training because of their
impairment, they would satisfy the CITW criteria for DSP qualification.

Factors not considered

The following factors are not considered when deciding if the customer
can undertake training or benefit from it:

-   the availability of suitable training in the local area
-   the availability of suitable work in the locally accessible labour
    market following completion of the training
-   if training will improve the customer's employability
-   the customer's level of motivation except when medical evidence
    indicates the lack of motivation is directly attributable to the
    impairment
-   the customer's preferences regarding the type of training
-   the customer's potential attractiveness to an employer

Customer can undertake training

The customer is considered to have a continuous inability to work or
train, not only if their impairment prevents them from training, but
also if:

-   their impairment allows them to undertake training, but
-   the training is unlikely to equip them with the necessary skills to
    undertake work within the next 2 years

In assessing if a customer can be trained for work within the next 2
years, the following factors are considered:

-   if the customer has the necessary prerequisite skills
-   the length of time it would usually take to complete the training,
    and
-   the nature of the training being dependent on the type of work the
    customer is potentially capable of performing

Currently studying/training

In some circumstances, a customer who is studying or training may still
qualify for DSP. To determine if the customer may satisfy the CITW
criteria the following points are considered:

-   if the customer would be able to benefit from such study or training
    within 2 years
-   if the study or training is full-time

If the answer is 'no' to these points, this may indicate the customer
meets the CITW criteria and therefore may qualify for DSP.

DSP recipients who commence study and remain entitled to DSP may be
entitled to an Education Entry Payment (EdEP).

Impairment Table changes from 1 April 2023

From 1 April 2023, a new version of Impairment Tables was introduced.
The new Tables are used to assess a customer's medical eligibility for
all DSP claims lodged on or after this date. See The Impairment Tables.

The Resources page contains links to online disability forms and pay
scales for determining minimum wage.
