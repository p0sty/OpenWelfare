Treatment specifics

Treatment cycles

A patient currently receiving PBS-subsidised treatment as of 1 April
2021 is considered to have started a cycle of treatment.

Treatment failures and breaks

-    Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail,
    or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine
    more than once
-    Once a patient has either failed to achieve or sustain a response
    to treatment 4 times, they are deemed to have completed a single
    treatment cycle. They must have at least a 12-month break in
    PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible
    to start a new treatment cycle
-    There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may
    have in their lifetime

Treatment with dupilumab 200mg or 300mg

-    swapping from 200mg to 300mg strength is not permitted within the
    continuing phase of the treatment. This is because the respective
    strengths are PBS approved for different patient cohorts
-    patients on 300mg can lower the dose to 200mg as continuing
    treatment
