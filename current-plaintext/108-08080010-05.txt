|                                   | be backdated to 1 July 2017. This |
|                                   | is because the change of          |

|                                   | rent payments to their landlord.  |
|                                   | Is RA still payable and why? +    |

|                                   | Answer: Yes, RA is payable. To    |
|                                   | qualify for RA a customer has to  |
|                                   | be liable to pay, or paying rent. |
|                                   | As the customer is still liable   |
|                                   | to pay rent, even though they may |
|                                   | not actually be paying rent, they |
|                                   | are still eligible for RA.        |
|                                   | However, if the person lives in   |
|                                   | informal rental arrangements,     |
|                                   | they will still be required to    |
|                                   | get their landlord to sign their  |
|                                   | Rent Certificate, verifying the   |
|                                   | amount of rent they pay.          |

|                                   | Answer: RA is paid to customers   |
|                                   | to help them meet the costs       |
|                                   | associated with renting their     |
|                                   | accommodation. If a customer has  |
|                                   | a rent liability and their        |
|                                   | circumstances allow them to       |
|                                   | qualify for payment, then RA will |
|                                   | be paid. The agency has no        |
|                                   | authority or ability to ensure    |
|                                   | that customers meet their         |
|                                   | financial obligations.            |

|                                   | If a landlord wants to know if a  |
|                                   | customer is receiving RA, the     |
|                                   | agency will not disclose          |
|                                   | protected/personal information to |
|                                   | third parties unless the          |

|                                   | disclosure. Note: it may be       |
|                                   | beneficial for the landlord to    |
|                                   | become a participating service    |
