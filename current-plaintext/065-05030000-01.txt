This document outlines information about aged care financial hardship
assistance available to care recipients.

Overview of financial hardship assistance for aged care

Financial hardship (hardship) assistance is available to care recipients
who do not have sufficient means to pay aged care fees and/or
accommodation payments due to circumstances beyond their control (for
example, difficulties selling their home).

Choosing to pay an accommodation payment above their means or giving
away assets are not beyond a care recipient’s control.

Hardship assistance reduces fees and/or accommodation payments:

-   The reduction amount is dependent on the care recipient’s income and
    assets after essential expenses and assets that cannot be sold or
    borrowed against are considered
-   If hardship is granted at the maximum rate, fees and/or
    accommodation payments can reduce to zero

Hardship assistance is:

-   not paid directly to the care recipient
-   paid as an additional subsidy to the service provider with the
    monthly funding claim

The hardship subsidy amount is:

-   equal to the fee reduction amount, and
-   cannot exceed the maximum fee or, for accommodation hardship, cannot
    exceed the maximum accommodation supplement, otherwise payable

The length of the hardship assistance depends on the care recipient’s
circumstances:

-   Up to 3 years from the date of assessment in addition to any
    backdated period
-   See Aged care financial hardship assistance – assessment

Services Australia also processes hardship claims for care recipients
getting a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) income support payment.

See Aged Care Specialist Officer (ACSO) for information on booking an
interview with an ACSO.

Eligibility for financial hardship assistance

There are no Australian residency requirements for hardship assistance.

A care recipient must have at the start date of hardship:

-   assets valued at less than the current financial hardship asset
    threshold, including those that the care recipient can sell or
    borrow against
-   income of less than 15% of the basic Age Pension amount (excluding
    supplements per fortnight) after essential expenses are deducted
-   not gifted more than the allowable threshold
-   completed a Calculation for your cost of care (means assessment)

See Financial hardship current and historical thresholds – assets and
income on the Resources page of Aged care financial hardship
assistance - assessment for current assets and fortnightly income
thresholds.

Other means of financial support

Care recipients are encouraged to access other means of financial
support:

-   This may include claiming income support hardship assistance, e.g.
    via the Home Equity Access Scheme

Service Officers must check to ensure the relevant care recipient is
eligible for financial hardship assistance before coding financial
hardship assistance in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP).

The aged care system validates when a care recipient is not eligible for
financial hardship assistance when a care recipient:

-   chooses not to have their means assessed and is deemed as means not
    disclosed (MND), or
-   has no valid means assessment

Types of care and fees eligible for hardship assistance

Home care – post 1 July 2014

The care recipient is receiving (or will receive) care under the post 1

to the post 1 July 2014 scheme. Eligible fees are:

Basic daily fee (BDF)

-   If the home care package level increases during the hardship period,
    the care recipient continues to pay the same BDF rate
-   If no home care package is assigned to the care recipient when the
    claim is assessed, the highest ACAT approved care level is used to
    calculate any hardship entitlement

-   home care hardship assistance claims must have an Aged Care
    Assessment Team (ACAT) approval before applying
-   Residential or respite care hardship assistance claims do not need
    ACAT approval before applying

Hardship claims

To apply for hardship assistance a care recipient, nominee or authorised
representative must complete:

-   Aged Care Claim for financial hardship assistance (SA462)

Photocopies of supporting documentation are accepted. Certified copies
are not needed

A letter is sent to the care recipient, nominee (if applicable) and aged
care service provider with the outcome of the hardship assistance claim

If hardship assistance is granted, the outcome letter includes:

-   fee type and amount of hardship assistance
-   date the hardship assistance stops

Services Australia sends the outcome letter within 28 days from the date
the claim is received

Note: the outcome letter is sent within 28 days of receiving the
additional information if Services Australia requests additional
information from the applicant.

Pre entry hardship claims

Care recipients can lodge a hardship claim before entry into care

The pre entry claim provides an estimate of hardship assistance the care
recipient may be eligible to receive

When the care recipient enters care, Services Australia reassesses and
code the hardship assessment based on the confirmed:

-   aged care fees, charges, and
-   circumstances of the care recipient

See Aged care financial hardship assistance - assessment for more
information.

Nominee, authorised representative or provider completes claim

A care recipient can have a claim for hardship assistance made on their
behalf by:

a Centrelink correspondence nominee. Go to the Nominee Link Summary
(NOLS) screen in Customer First to confirm nominee status. See Accepting
and disclosing information

an aged care nominee for a DVA care recipient. See Aged care request for
a nominee or executor for details on how to confirm the nominee status

an authorised representative including:

-   an Enduring Power of Attorney, Power of Attorney (Financial)
-   a person/organisation holding an administrative or financial order

the aged care service provider currently providing (or will provide)
care to the care recipient

Unable to sign

The Director of Nursing at the aged care residential care service can
sign the claim form if:

-   a care recipient is unable to sign the claim form, and does not have
    an authorised representative

A letter from a doctor, hospital or social worker confirming the care
recipient is unable to sign due to the nature of their medical condition
must be lodged with the claim form

Deceased

-   If a care recipient is deceased, only the administrator or executor
    of the estate can legally act on behalf of the estate
-   The applicant must provide evidence they are the administrator or
    executor of the deceased estate

Ongoing hardship assistance

If a care recipient needs ongoing hardship assistance:

It is important that Services Australia receives a new hardship
assistance claim before the end of the current hardship assistance
period

-   This is to ensure any hardship assistance payment is continuous

The hardship assistance end date is advised in the hardship claim
outcome letter

-   No end date reminder letters are sent

Note: before the hardship end date, Services Australia may review a care
recipient’s circumstances to confirm ongoing eligibility in the current
hardship assistance period. For example, hardship may be reviewed to
confirm if the care recipient still has a protected person residing in
the principal home.
