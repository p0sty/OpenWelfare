|                                   | finalise Ted's DAP claim. This is |
|                                   | because if PPL or FTB is claimed  |
|                                   | by either the customer or their   |
|                                   | partner, proof of the child's     |
|                                   | birth can be used for DAP claim.  |

DAP ACS coding

An update may be required to the Accommodation Details (AC) screen when
processing a DAP claim and the customer has advised a change in marital
status. If the AC screen has previously been coded, a new line of AC
coding will be required. The update required to the AC screen depends on
what is already known on the record.
