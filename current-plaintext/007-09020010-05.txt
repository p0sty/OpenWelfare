Suggested text for Q999

Suggested text for Q999 letters created for primary/secondary claimants
when a primary claimant is transferring their PPL entitlement to their
partner:

Q999 - Primary claimant only has lodged a claim - customer is
transferring their full PPL entitlement and has returned to work before
lodging PPL claim

'In your claim you indicated that you have returned to work and intend
to transfer your full Parental Leave Pay entitlement to another person.
Before we finalise your claim for Parental Leave Pay, the person you
intend to transfer your payment to, must lodge their claim. If they do
not lodge their claim within 14 days of this notice being issued,
Parental Leave Pay may not be payable for <child's name>.'

Q999 NEF text to secondary claimant - primary claimant did not submit an
effective PPL claim

'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because <your partner><the person
who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you> has not
submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay
for <CHILD NAME> you will need to contact us once <your partner><the
person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay entitlement to you>
has submitted their claim.'

Q999 NEF text to primary claimant - secondary claimant did not submit an
effective PPL claim

'We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because <your partner><the person
you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to> has not
submitted a claim for Paid Parental Leave. To be paid Parental Leave Pay
for <CHILD NAME> you will need to contact us once <your partner><the
person you are transferring your Parental Leave Pay entitlement to > has
submitted their claim.'

Q999 text to secondary claimant when claim cannot be finalised until
closer to the PPL nominated start date

'As the nominated start for your Parental Leave Pay is not until <date>,
we cannot finalise your claim until <Nominated Start Date>. If <your
partner><the person who is transferring their Parental Leave Pay
entitlement to you> changes their nominated start date for the Paid
Parental Leave to an earlier date, you will need to contact us on 136
150 so we can assess your claim sooner.'

Q999 NEF text to Secondary Claimant when Secondary claimant is applying
for PPL and primary claimant has not transferred any PPL period or
Flexible PPL days to them (pre-birth claims only)

'In your claim you indicated that you are claiming Parental Leave Pay.

We cannot pay you Parental Leave Pay because no-one has transferred any
Paid Parental Leave to you. To be paid Parental Leave Pay for your
newborn you will need to lodge a new claim for Paid Parental Leave if
your partner transfers some of their entitlement to you.'

If you wish to claim Dad and Partner Pay, go to Servicesaustralia.gov.au
and search Dad and Partner Pay to test your eligibility.'

|                                   | first child. Sarah enquires about |
|                                   | making a per-birth claim for PPL. |

|                                   | As the birth mother, Sarah must   |
|                                   | be assessed as the primary        |
|                                   | claimant for PPL unless           |

|                                   | are met. As Sarah intends on      |
|                                   | caring for the newborn child and  |
|                                   | is capable of doing so,           |

|                                   | claimant if Sarah wanted to       |

|                                   | because Julie is still in         |
|                                   | hospital and John has taken time  |
