|                                   | child is 26 September 2019 to 22  |

|                                   | Kim.                              |

|                                   | current PPL work test, some of    |
|                                   | these days can be included when   |

|                                   | By using this period, the Service |
|                                   | Officer can include Kim's         |

|                                   | Jo had a history of miscarriages  |
|                                   | during the first trimester of     |
|                                   | pregnancy. When Jo became         |
|                                   | pregnant again, the doctor        |
|                                   | advised taking a period of leave  |
|                                   | from employment. Jo followed the  |
|                                   | doctor's advice and took leave    |
|                                   | without pay from the full-time    |
|                                   | job of 6 years to minimise the    |
|                                   | possibility of another            |
|                                   | miscarriage.                      |

|                                   | After 99 days of leave without    |
|                                   | pay, Jo returned to work          |
|                                   | full-time. Despite working in     |
|                                   | excess of 330 hours of qualifying |
|                                   | work, Jo had a break of greater   |
|                                   | than 84 consecutive days          |
|                                   | (equivalent to 12 weeks) between  |
|                                   | 2 qualifying work days. As a      |
|                                   | result, Jo had a non-permissible  |
|                                   | break and did not satisfy the     |
|                                   | normal work test.                 |

|                                   | However, a medical certificate    |
|                                   | was provided, confirming Jo was   |
|                                   | unfit for work due to             |
|                                   | complications with the pregnancy. |
|                                   | Jo's employer also advised that   |
|                                   | Jo would have worked during the   |
|                                   | period. As a result, Jo has met   |
|                                   | the work test when the evidence   |
|                                   | of the complications with the     |
|                                   | pregnancy were considered.        |

|                                   | casual teacher. Jean's doctor     |
|                                   | advised Jean to take a period of  |
|                                   | leave from employment. Due to     |
|                                   | being unwell, Jean followed the   |
|                                   | doctor's advice and took leave    |
|                                   | without pay from Jean's casual    |
|                                   | job of 3 years.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Jean's condition did not       |
|                                   | improve, Jean did not return to   |
|                                   | work and therefore had only       |
|                                   | performed 85 days of qualifying   |
|                                   | work during the work test period. |
|                                   | Jean had a break of greater than  |
|                                   | 84 consecutive days (equivalent   |
|                                   | to 12 weeks) between 2 qualifying |
|                                   | work days. As a result, Jean had  |
|                                   | a non-permissible break and did   |
|                                   | not satisfy the normal work test. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jean was asked to and provided a  |
|                                   | letter from Jean's medical        |
|                                   | practitioner that confirmed Jean  |
|                                   | was unfit for work due to         |
|                                   | excessive vomiting and            |
|                                   | dehydration as a result of the    |
|                                   | pregnancy. Jean was also asked to |
|                                   | provide evidence from the         |
|                                   | employer to confirm Jean would    |
|                                   | have worked during the work test  |
|                                   | period had it not been for the    |
|                                   | pregnancy related illness. Jean   |
|                                   | contacted the agency to advise    |
|                                   | that the employer has refused to  |
|                                   | provide the evidence. As a        |
|                                   | result, Jean's application was    |
|                                   | rejected, as the agency could not |
|                                   | be satisfied that Jean would have |
|                                   | worked the required time had it   |
|                                   | not been for the pregnancy        |
|                                   | related illness.                  |

|                                   | During the PPL work test period   |
|                                   | Penny was working full time in a  |
|                                   | job that required Penny to stand  |
|                                   | for long periods of time and      |
|                                   | involved some heavy lifting.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Due to standing for long periods  |
|                                   | of time, Penny experienced back,  |
|                                   | leg and hand pain, which seemed   |
|                                   | to get worse as the pregnancy     |
|                                   | progressed.                       |

|                                   | As a result, Penny decided to     |
|                                   | start maternity leave earlier     |
|                                   | than expected. Penny ceased work  |
|                                   | on 11 January.                    |

|                                   | As Penny had a non-permissible    |
|                                   | break of more than 84 consecutive |
|                                   | days (equivalent to 12 weeks)     |
|                                   | between 2 qualifying workdays,    |
|                                   | the normal work test was not      |
|                                   | satisfied, and Penny's PPL claim  |
|                                   | was rejected.                     |

|                                   | Penny then provided medical       |
|                                   | evidence from a doctor which      |
|                                   | listed the reasons why Penny      |
|                                   | finished work earlier than        |
|                                   | expected. However, the medical    |
|                                   | evidence did not state that the   |
|                                   | complication/illness was          |
|                                   | exacerbated by pregnancy, and     |
|                                   | prevented Penny from working. A   |

|                                   | also provided saying that Penny   |
|                                   | would have worked for the period  |
|                                   | had it not been for the           |

|                                   | As the medical evidence did not   |
|                                   | state that Penny was unfit for    |
|                                   | work due to the                   |
|                                   | complication/illness being        |
|                                   | exacerbated by the pregnancy, the |

|                                   | which prevented Penny working,    |

|                                   | 1 March 2020. In July 2020,       |
|                                   | Warren lodges a claim for DAP and |
|                                   | has nominated the DAP period to   |

|                                   | following James's birth, as       |
|                                   | Warren was on unpaid leave for    |
|                                   | this period.                      |

|                                   | The claim indicates that Warren   |
|                                   | is not working at least 8 hours   |
|                                   | per week every week in the work   |
|                                   | test period 3 February 2019 to 1  |
|                                   | March 2020. Warren also indicated |
|                                   | having more than a 12 week gap    |
|                                   | between 2 consecutive work days   |
|                                   | in the work test period, but had  |
|                                   | worked for more than 330 hours.   |
|                                   | As a result, Warren was required  |
|                                   | to supply evidence to support the |
|                                   | work test by demonstrating work   |
|                                   | history over the 13 month period. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Upon receipt of the evidence, it  |
|                                   | is established that Warren        |
|                                   | started working for Warren's      |
|                                   | current employer in July 2019 and |
|                                   | was unemployed for 6 months       |
|                                   | before that. Although Warren has  |
|                                   | worked in excess of 330 hours,    |
|                                   | there is no qualifying period of  |
|                                   | 10 months in the work test        |
|                                   | period. As a result Warren does   |
|                                   | not meet the work test for DAP.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, as DAP can be paid for   |
|                                   | up to 12 months after the date of |
|                                   | birth or entry into care of a     |
|                                   | child, Warren should be advised   |
|                                   | that the work test may be met in  |
|                                   | future if another period of       |
|                                   | unpaid leave is taken and to      |
|                                   | re-test eligibility with a        |
|                                   | revised start date if this is the |
|                                   | case.                             |

| Evidentiary Requirements          | In all cases, medical evidence is |
|                                   | required from a doctor stating    |
|                                   | what the complication is and that |
|                                   | it is a direct result of the      |
|                                   | pregnancy or for a pre-existing   |
|                                   | condition or illness that is      |
|                                   | exacerbated as a result of this   |
|                                   | pregnancy.                        |

|                                   | The doctor also needs to state    |
|                                   | that the complication/illness     |
|                                   | prevents the person from          |
|                                   | performing their current paid     |
|                                   | work. If the customer does not    |
|                                   | satisfy all the above, they do    |
|                                   | not meet the requirements of 36A  |
|                                   | and do not meet the PPL Work      |
