This document outlines how to access archived customer letters and
messages (SMS or email) using the ACE application.

Using ACE

ACE allows staff to retrieve, view, and print letters and messages that
have been:

-   generated in the mainframe system, and
-   stored to the archive

Letters and messages store to ACE when the status updates to Printed:

-   letters usually store 2 working days after the date created
-   immediate print letters and messages store straight away

Some letters and messages created before September 2013 may not be
stored in ACE. These are archived to Customer Archive Retrieval (CAR).

The Resources page contains intranet links to ACE and to the video, How
to use the Merge PDF Commands.
