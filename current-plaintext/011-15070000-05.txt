|                                   | received and there is no claim    |
|                                   | registered. Should the claim be   |

|                                   | Yes. Due to arrival of            |
|                                   | correspondence, the claim needs   |
|                                   | to be registered and the history  |
|                                   | statement issued as part of same  |

|                                   | registered. What steps should be  |
|                                   | taken?                            |
|                                   |                                   |
