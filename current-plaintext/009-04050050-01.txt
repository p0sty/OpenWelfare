This document outlines how to code paper claims for Carer Payment (CP)
for a disabled adult and 1 or 2 children, each with a disability or
medical condition (multiple care).

Grant or rejection of claim

On completion of recording the paper claim all the carer's details will
be registered on the system and their record should be linked to the
care receiver's record. The system will process the information and will
grant or reject the claim accordingly.

Claims lodged after the death of a customer would be assessed under some
circumstances.

The Resources page contains contact details for Services Australia's DVA
