+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Question: What is the tax-free    |
|                                   | threshold?                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The standard tax-free     |
|                                   | threshold is $18,200. This may be |
|                                   | higher if a person has received   |
|                                   | an income support payment during  |
|                                   | a relevant financial year. See    |

| 2                                 | Question: Does that mean anyone   |
|                                   | who earns under $18,200 will not  |
|                                   | need to lodge a tax return?       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: Some people who earn      |
|                                   | under $18,200 will not be         |
|                                   | required to lodge a tax return    |
|                                   | for income purposes.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, others whose income is   |
|                                   | under the tax-free threshold of   |
|                                   | $18,200 may still be required to  |
|                                   | lodge a tax return. These reasons |
|                                   | include:                          |

|                                   |     income is below the tax free  |
|                                   |     threshold)                    |

|                                   | To determine if they are required |
|                                   | to lodge, they must visit the ATO |

|                                   | Answer: It is preferred that the  |

|                                   | advice with the ATO. The ATO will |
|                                   | then automatically advise the     |
|                                   | agency of the non-lodgement       |

|                                   | workflow can be run again if the  |
|                                   | customer's details need updating. |
|                                   | If the system determines the      |
|                                   | person is required to lodge, they |
|                                   | must lodge the ATO 'Non-lodgement |
|                                   | advice' with the ATO.             |

|                                   | lodged?                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Answer: The ATO will              |
|                                   | automatically advise Services     |
|                                   | Australia of the outcome. The     |
|                                   | advice is generally received      |
|                                   | within 28 days.                   |

|                                   | If the ATO confirms the person is |
|                                   | not required to lodge, the most   |
|                                   | recent income estimate for the    |
|                                   | previous financial year will be   |
|                                   | used to reconcile the customer's  |
|                                   | Family Tax Benefit payment. If    |
|                                   | this amount is not accurate, the  |
|                                   | customer may update their income  |
|                                   | for the previous financial year.  |

|                                   | will only occur once all required |
|                                   | information is available, e.g.    |
|                                   | adequate income details for both  |
|                                   | the customer and their partner if |
|                                   | they have a partner. To ensure    |
|                                   | the reconciliation amount is      |
|                                   | correct, customers must still     |
|                                   | confirm their income with         |
|                                   | Services Australia, even if they  |
|                                   | have lodged an ATO non-lodgement  |
