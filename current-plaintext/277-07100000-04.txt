The Child Support Guide 2.5.2: Additional income earned post separation

Legislation

Links to the Federal Register of Legislation site go to a 'Series' page.
Select the 'Latest' version.

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, section 44, Post Separation Costs

Authorisations and delegations

Service Officer (SO4)

Determine an application to exclude post separation income from a child
support assessment.

This does not prevent an officer at the SO3 level who has the support of
their Team Leader (TL) from carrying out this type of work. The final
decision to either accept or refuse the application is made by an
officer at the SO4 level or above.

For more information about authorisations and delegations see Child
Support Services, Delegations and Authorisations.
