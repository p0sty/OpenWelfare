This document outlines information for social workers when determining
eligibility for Income Management (IM) and enhanced IM as a Vulnerable
Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR).

The IM program closed to new entrants on 4 September 2023, customers
that are identified for welfare quarantining under this measure or move
between measures on the hierarchy and otherwise meet the eligibility
criteria to participate, must commence enhanced IM.

Customers on IM under the VWPR measure may choose to move to enhanced
IM.

Eligibility for IM and enhanced IM under VWPR measure

This procedure is not relevant for customers who are auto triggered for
the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient IM and enhanced IM measure.

Customers will be considered eligible to be placed on to IM or enhanced
IM by a Services Australia social worker, at their discretion, if the
customer's individual behaviours or circumstances provide evidence they
are vulnerable and/or at-risk and would benefit from welfare
quarantining.

Welfare quarantining is an additional tool for social workers to use
when working with vulnerable or at-risk customers.

Social workers are responsible for making a determination of a
customer's vulnerability and will consider if welfare quarantining is
appropriate for the customer.

Criteria under VWPR measure

A customer is to be welfare quarantined under the Vulnerable Welfare
Payment Recipient (VWPR) measure if they meet the following conditions:

-   A Services Australia social worker has determined that the customer
    is a Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient
-   The customer's usual place of residence is within a VWPR Income
    Management area or enhanced IM location
-   The customer is in receipt of an eligible welfare payment
-   The customer is not already subject to an IM or enhanced IM measure
    which is above the Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient (VWPR)
    measure in the hierarchy of measures
-   The customer does not have an excluded payment nominee. Note: the
    social worker may choose to cancel the nominee arrangement at the
    time they declare the customer as a Vulnerable Welfare Payment
    Recipient if it is shown that the arrangement is not in the
    customer's best interests

Factors to consider

To determine if a customer is a Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipient for
welfare quarantining, the social worker considers whether:

-   the customer is experiencing an indicator of vulnerability
-   the customer is meeting the essential needs of their partner,
    children or other dependents
-   IM or enhanced IM is an appropriate support for the person to meet
    their responsibilities, build and maintain self-care and manage
    their money

Indicators of vulnerability

Customers may be considered experiencing vulnerability due to one of the
following indicators:

-   financial hardship
-   financial exploitation
-   failure to undertake reasonable self-care
-   homelessness
