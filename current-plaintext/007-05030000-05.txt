|                                   | Answer: DAP is counted as         |
|                                   | ordinary income for calculating   |
|                                   | the rate of income support        |

|                                   | This means if the customer        |

|                                   | an ISP, the ISP rate will reduce  |
|                                   | during the DAP entitlement        |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | If the ISP reduces to a zero rate |
|                                   | due to DAP, the ISP will cancel.  |
|                                   | The customer must lodge a new     |
|                                   | claim if they wish to re test     |
|                                   | their eligibility for an ISP.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the DAP nominated start date   |
|                                   | is backdated to a date that falls |
|                                   | within a period for which an ISP  |
|                                   | has already been paid to the      |
|                                   | customer (and/or their partner),  |
|                                   | an ISP overpayment will be        |
|                                   | raised.                           |

|                                   | Darren has claimed and has been   |
|                                   | paid DAP and had a nominated      |
|                                   | start date of 1 February. On 11   |
|                                   | February, Darren contacts to      |
|                                   | advise of the requirement to      |
|                                   | travel interstate on 9 February   |
|                                   | as a relative was hospitalised.   |

|                                   | Darren's wife and new baby did    |
|                                   | not travel with Darren and Darren |
|                                   | is still interstate. Darren       |
|                                   | queries whether eligibility will  |
|                                   | continue for DAP and whether      |
|                                   | there will be a requirement to    |
|                                   | pay back some of the payment      |

|                                   | for 1 or more days during the DAP |

|                                   | customer will remain eligible for |
|                                   | DAP. As Darren has had to travel  |

|                                   | emergency, Darren must be advised |
|                                   | eligibility will continue for DAP |
|                                   | and Darren will not be required   |

|                                   | working full time. Lisa has       |
|                                   | arranged to take 2 weeks unpaid   |
|                                   | leave commencing 15 January 2019  |
|                                   | and has claimed DAP for this      |

|                                   | during the DAP period, Lisa is    |
|                                   | unable to care for Grace for a    |
|                                   | period of 3 days. Lisa is         |
|                                   | concerned that not providing care |
|                                   | for Grace, there may be no        |

|                                   | Outcome: Lisa must be advised     |
|                                   | that although not physically      |
|                                   | caring for baby Grace,            |
|                                   | eligibility continues for DAP for |
|                                   | this period, as Lisa is residing  |
|                                   | with Grace and would maintain a   |
|                                   | level of care, control and        |
|                                   | oversight even whilst unwell.     |
