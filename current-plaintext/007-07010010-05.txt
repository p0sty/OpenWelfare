|                                   | If Liz meets eligibility          |
|                                   | requirements for FTB, it would be |
|                                   | payable from 3 March. This is     |
|                                   | when Pili was entrusted as part   |

|                                   | can commence because Pili was     |

|                                   | eligibility for FTB Part A. If    |

|                                   | DAP. Although the adoption is     |
|                                   | pending finalisation, PPL and DAP |
|                                   | can still be assessed and granted |
|                                   | as Cobar has been placed in their |
|                                   | care. To be eligible for PPL and  |

|                                   | (including NBS/NBU) for Cobar.    |
|                                   | Darel could be eligible for DAP,  |

|                                   | requirements, Joy would have been |
|                                   | eligible for PPL rather than      |
|                                   | NBS/NBU.                          |

|                                   | Sam is 12 years old and was       |
|                                   | entrusted to Tracey and Dennis'   |

|                                   | child seven years ago. During     |

|                                   | decided to adopt Sam legally and  |
|                                   | commenced the process of          |

|                                   | foster care arrangement. This     |
|                                   | means that An authorised party    |
|                                   | did not place Sam for the purpose |
|                                   | of adoption. As such, Tracey and  |
