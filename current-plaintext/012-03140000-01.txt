in eHealth Program (EHP) system as a record of what is received.

Evidence of identity (EOI)

New EOI documentation is required for both individual and site Public

Service has changed (see Process page).

Eligibility

-   that the person applying to become the Authoriser (for HI Service
    purposes this is a Responsible Officer) has the authority to commit
    the business, and
-   the business’s existence with an Australian Business Number (ABN)

The Process page contains the process to follow when an organisation
applies to the HI Service.

The Resources page contains links to the Australian Business Register
(ABR) Website and Tier 3 contact details.
