|                                   | sets the estimating parent's      |
|                                   | income at $52,000 for the period  |
|                                   | from 01/07/2018 - 30/03/2019.     |
|                                   | Therefore, from 01/04/2019 -      |
|                                   | 30/06/2019, the Estimate of $0 is |
|                                   | back in force. The actual income  |
|                                   | for 2018/19 is higher than the    |
|                                   | expected ATI. When reviewing the  |
|                                   | estimate period 01/04/2019 -      |
|                                   | 30/06/2019, the Service Officer   |
|                                   | confirms that an event affecting  |
|                                   | the accuracy of the Estimate has  |
|                                   | occurred on 01/05/2019. The       |
|                                   | estimating parent commenced       |
|                                   | earning $2,000 per week.          |

|                                   | Action:                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Service Office should         |
|                                   | complete the review and determine |
|                                   | if an amendment is required. If   |
|                                   | appropriate, the Estimate can     |
|                                   | then be amended from the Date of  |
|                                   | Event until the 30/06/2019. In    |
|                                   | the above example, an amendment   |
|                                   | of $2,000 per week would be keyed |
|                                   | for the period from 01/05/2019 -  |
|                                   | 30/06/2019.                       |

|                                   | Note: when keying, both the Date  |
|                                   | of Event and the Date of          |
|                                   | Notification must match the date  |
|                                   | that the amendment is to take     |
|                                   | effect. In the example above,     |
|                                   | 01/05/2019 should be recorded in  |
|                                   | both of these date fields         |

|                                   | date should remain as 30/06/2019. |
|                                   | If the income earned was not      |
|                                   | periodic, it would first need to  |
|                                   | be converted to a periodic        |
|                                   | amount. In the example above, the |
|                                   | Service Officer calculates that   |
|                                   | the amount (01/10/2018 -          |
|                                   | 31/12/2018 $30,000) would         |
|                                   | otherwise annualise to $120,000.  |
|                                   | The Service Officer would key     |
|                                   | this as a periodic amount of      |
|                                   | $10,000 per month from the Date   |
|                                   | of Event 01/10/2018 until the     |
|                                   | 30/06/2019. The Date of           |
|                                   | Notification must be keyed to     |
|                                   | match the Date of Event that is   |
|                                   | 01/10/2018 in this example. The   |
|                                   | periodic amount could also be     |
|                                   | weekly or fortnightly if required |
|                                   | to provide the most accurate      |
|                                   | income.                           |

|                                   | Note: to prevent an inaccurate    |
|                                   | annualised income Service         |
|                                   | Officers should not short date    |

|                                   | prior to the IAO start date and   |
|                                   | should not key a one off amount.  |

|                                   | not prevent amendment to the      |

|                                   | period. An event affecting the    |
|                                   | accuracy of the Estimate occurs   |
|                                   | DURING the IAO. Estimate then     |

|                                   | Example:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An estimate of $0 is lodged from  |
|                                   | 01/07/2018. A COA decision then   |
|                                   | sets estimating parent’s income   |
|                                   | at $52,000 from 01/07/2018 -      |
|                                   | 31/12/2018. The Estimate of $0    |
|                                   | comes back into force from        |
|                                   | 01/01/2019 – 30/06/2019. The      |
|                                   | actual income for 2018/19 is      |
|                                   | higher than the expected ATI.     |
|                                   | When reviewing the estimate       |
|                                   | period 01/01/2019 – 30/06/2019,   |
|                                   | the Service Officer confirms the  |
|                                   | parent started a new job on       |
|                                   | 01/12/2018 earning $2,000 per     |
|                                   | week (approx. $104,000 per annum) |
|                                   | which continued until 30/06/2019. |
|                                   | This event occurred during the    |
|                                   | IAO period and affected the       |
|                                   | accuracy of the estimate that     |
|                                   | continued after the IAO ended.    |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Use 01/01/2019 as the Date of     |
|                                   | Event for the Amended estimate.   |
|                                   | Although the estimating parent’s  |
|                                   | income originally changed on      |
|                                   | 01/12/2018 during the IAO period, |
|                                   | the first date that the estimated |
|                                   | income became inaccurate in the   |
|                                   | assessment was 01/01/2019. In     |
|                                   | this example, an amended estimate |
|                                   | of $2,000 per week would be       |
|                                   | recorded with a Date of Event     |
|                                   | 01/01/2019 until 30/06/2019 and   |
|                                   | replaces the inaccurate estimate  |
|                                   | of $0 in the assessment.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: when keying, both the Date  |
|                                   | of Event and the Date of          |
|                                   | Notification must match the date  |
|                                   | that the amendment is to take     |
|                                   | effect. In the example above,     |
|                                   | 01/01/2019 should be recorded in  |
|                                   | both of these date fields.        |

| 2 children of the assessment, one | Parent A has an assessed          |
| child in each parent’s care       | liability of $2000 for child one. |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | liability of $1416 (FAR) for      |
|                                   | child 2, based on an estimate of  |
|                                   | $18000.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Parent A was the overall payer    |
|                                   | with an assessed amount of $584   |
|                                   | ($2000 – $1416).                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Parent B lodged a tax return and  |
|                                   | their estimated income of $18,000 |
|                                   | was auto-reconciled using their   |
|                                   | higher actual income of $23,000.  |
|                                   | Using the higher income of        |
|                                   | $23,000 resulted in Parent B’s    |
|                                   | FAR of $1416 reducing to $0.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Parent A’s liability as the       |
|                                   | overall payer increased from $584 |
|                                   | to $2000. This was because Parent |
|                                   | A’s rate of $2000 was no longer   |
|                                   | being reduced by Parent B’s FAR   |
|                                   | of $1416.                         |

|                                   | In this example, Parent B has     |
|                                   | benefitted from their own         |
|                                   | underestimation. The estimate     |
|                                   | should not have been reconciled.  |
