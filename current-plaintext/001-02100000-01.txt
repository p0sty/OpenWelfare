This document contains information on the Self-Employment Assistance
(which replaced the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)) including
application and assessment processes and associated payments.

Self-Employment Assistance

From 1 July 2022, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations
(DEWR) implemented Self-Employment Assistance. This replaced NEIS
Assistance.

For Services Australia staff, the Self-Employment Assistance Operational
Blueprint provides necessary information to cover both programs. See the
Resources page for further information.

Self-Employment Assistance overview

Self-Employment Assistance offers flexible services to help people who
are interested in becoming self-employed or people who are existing
micro-business owners. Participants can choose the services they wish to
access, selecting from 6 free services including:

-   Exploring Self-Employment Workshops
-   Small Business Training (fully meets mutual obligation requirements
    and may meet the short course guidelines for the Education Entry
    Payment (EdEP))
-   Business Plan Development
-   Business Advice Sessions
-   Business Health Checks (for existing micro-business owners), and
-   Small Business Coaching (fully meets mutual obligation requirements)

Further detail on each of these is available on the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) website.

If eligible, Self-Employment Allowance may be paid for up to 39 weeks.

Small Business Coaching under Self-Employment Assistance:

-   is administered by DEWR
-   is delivered by Self-Employment Assistance Providers
-   runs for 52 weeks

Participation in some elements is considered to be an approved activity
for payments with mutual obligation requirements.

Self-Employment Assistance enquiry by customer

If the customer is already connected to an employment services provider,
advise them to contact their provider for information.

Advise all other customers to search for their local Self-Employment
Assistance provider on the Workforce Australia website.

Eligibility for Self-Employment Assistance

To be eligible customers must satisfy all of the following criteria:

-   be at least 15 years of age (a customer must be 18 years of age to
    access Small Business Coaching)
-   be an Australian citizen, or the holder of a permanent visa, or a
    nominated Visa holder (including a New Zealand Special Category
    Visa, Temporary Protection Visa Holder and a Safe Haven Visa Holder)
-   have working rights in Australia (that is, not be on a student,
    visitor or other non-work visa)
-   not be an undischarged bankrupt
-   not already be in education and/or employment for more than 25 hours
    per week

If the customer is already self-employed or already has a business idea,
their local Self-Employment Assistance provider will work with them to
assess whether their business or business idea is eligible.

Note: Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers cannot participate
in Self-Employment Assistance while connected to a CDP provider.

Small Business Coaching under Self-Employment Assistance

Business mentoring and support is an essential component of
Self-Employment Assistance. Participants will receive business mentoring
for 52 weeks under the Small Business Coaching phase. Participants will
also receive advice about organisational, financial and marketing issues
to support the development of their business.

Participants can receive Self-Employment Allowance for the first 39
weeks of the 52 week Small Business Coaching phase. The amount of
Self-Employment Allowance payable will not be affected by income from
the job seeker's business, as the allowance is paid by DEWR.

The Self-Employment Assistance provider is able to arrange additional
mentoring and support for some individuals and Indigenous Australian job
seekers where they consider it to be appropriate.

Self-Employment Allowance

Most Self-Employment Assistance participants transfer from their income
support payment to Self-Employment Allowance after they complete Small
Business training and commence in Small Business Coaching.

Certain customers may be receiving a higher rate of income support than
the amount paid under Self-Employment Allowance, for example:

-   JobSeeker Payment (JSP) and Special Benefit (SpB) job seekers who
    are single with a dependent child
-   JSP and SpB single principal carers with long term exemptions
-   JSP and SpB job seekers aged 60 and over, who have been in receipt
    of an income support payment for more than 9 continuous months, and
-   JSP and SpB job seekers who are assessed as either 'Illness
    Separated', 'Respite Care Couple' or 'Partner in prison'

These job seekers, if they have no affecting income, should be eligible
to continue to receive a partial rate of their income support payment on
top of their Self-Employment Allowance after the dollar-for-dollar
reduction is applied.

Customers in receipt of Austudy and Youth Allowance (job seeker,
apprentice and student) will automatically cancel 'CPP - Customer on
Precluding Payment' when DEWR notify they are in receipt of
Self-Employment Allowance. Other customers may cancel 'SEA -
Self-Employment Allowance' if they are no longer eligible for their
income support payment due to receipt of Self-Employment Allowance.

Customers in receipt of the below payments can choose to remain on their
income support payment while participating in Small Business Coaching,
up to the maximum of 52 weeks. All other pension/payment and Small
Business Coaching eligibility criteria must be met. Alternatively, they
may elect to receive the Self-Employment Allowance and a partial rate of
their income support payment.

-   Carer Payment (CP)
-   Age Pension
-   Parenting Payment (Partnered and Single)
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Partner Service Pension, or
-   War Widow(er) Pension

Self-Employment Assistance rental assistance is available for up to 26
weeks to Small Business Coaching participants if eligible. Payment of
this is determined by DEWR.

Self-Employment Allowance recipients who do not receive an income
support payment may be eligible for a Low Income Health Care Card (LIC).

Small Business Coaching and Disability Employment Services (DES) or ParentsNext (PNX)

Customers may concurrently participate in DES or PNX and Small Business
Coaching. Once a job seeker is participating with DES or PNX, their DES
or PNX provider may refer them to participate in Self-Employment
Assistance, which includes Small Business Coaching.

Participating in Small Business Coaching and DES or PNX satisfies the
mutual obligation or participation requirements for income support
payments. Participants will still be required to report regularly to
Services Australia to receive income support payments, including when
they are on partial rates. Any business income must be declared and
assessed as normal.

Rate of Self-Employment Allowance

The amount of Self-Employment Allowance paid is equivalent to the
'single, 22 and over, with no children' rate of JobSeeker Payment (JSP).
Self-Employment Allowance reduces relevant income support (including
add-ons) on a dollar-for-dollar basis, meaning some participants may no
longer be entitled to their income support payment.

Note: customers receiving Self-Employment Allowance cannot obtain early
release of superannuation. Self-Employment Allowance is specifically
excluded by this legislation. Queries regarding this should be referred
to Department of Employment and Work Relations National Customer Service
Line.

Eligibility for income support after Self-Employment Allowance ceases

The maximum period that Self-Employment Allowance is payable to a
participant is 39 weeks from the start of the 52 week Small Business
Coaching period.

As a result, these customers may contact the agency to test their
eligibility for an income support payment for the final 13 weeks of
Small Business Coaching. Provided these customers meet all other
eligibility requirements, participation in Small Business Coaching does
not preclude them from income support.

Participation in Small Business Coaching fully satisfies a customer's
mutual obligation requirements or compulsory participation requirements.
This means the job seeker will not be referred to a provider where they
claim an income support payment during the last 13 weeks of Small
Business Coaching, because they are already connected to a
Self-Employment Assistance provider and not eligible for other
employment services.

See the Process page for coding procedures where a Small Business
Coaching participant contacts the agency to claim an income support
payment, or to have their rate of payment restored to the correct rate,
following the cessation of their Self-Employment Allowance after 39
weeks. Note: the Small Business Coaching participant will be prompted by
their provider to supply their Self-Employment Allowance cessation
letter as evidence.

Small Business Coaching participants who were receiving JobSeeker
Payment (JSP), Special Benefit (SpB) or Youth Allowance (YA) and whose
payment was reduced or cancelled due to receiving the Self-Employment
Allowance, will receive an advice from DEWR to verify that their
Self-Employment Allowance has ceased.

After the 39 weeks, the system will automatically zero the
Self-Employment Allowance on the Other Government Payments (OGP) screen.
Staff may need to end any manual rate overrides that existed to continue
partial rate payments during the 39 weeks of Self-Employment Allowance.

The Resources page has information on historical manual rate coding, a
link to the Self-Employment Assistance Helpdesk, a link to Workforce
Australia and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and
Self-Employment Assistance homepages.
