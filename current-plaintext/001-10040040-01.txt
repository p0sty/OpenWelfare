This document outlines guidelines for managing outstanding compliance
action when a job seeker or participant, has been imprisoned.

Note: the term 'job seeker' in this file also refers to Community
Development Program (CDP) participants.

Outstanding compliance action

The job seeker compliance system is the policy framework that is used
when a job seeker fails to meet compulsory requirements.

Two different job seeker compliance systems are used to manage job
seeker compliance:

The Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF):

-   Job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework include
    those who are serviced by Workforce Australia provider, Workforce
    Australia Online, and Disability Employment Services (DES) providers

The Job Seeker Compliance Framework (JSCF):

-   Participants managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework are
    declared program participants in the Community Development Program
    (CDP)

A person who is imprisoned is no longer eligible for payment and
therefore is not required to comply with compulsory requirements from
the date of imprisonment. Generally, outstanding compliance is
automatically finalised when imprisonment is recorded, however, this may
occasionally require manual intervention.

Outstanding compliance action includes:

-   Participation suspensions that are applied when a job seeker doesn't
    meet their compulsory requirements
-   Capability Assessments (Targeted Compliance Framework only)
-   Outstanding compliance investigations
-   Comprehensive Compliance Assessments (CCA) (Job Seeker Compliance
    Framework only)

Participation suspensions and non-compliance events when job seeker is imprisoned

Both the Employment Services System (ESS) and Services Australia systems
have an automatic validation process that prevents inappropriate
participation suspensions from occurring.

Participation suspensions are automatically applied when a job seeker
has compulsory requirements and is in receipt of a participation
payment. Occasionally, where the job seeker is imprisoned after a
participation suspension is applied, this will prevent the imprisonment
suspension from occurring.

This means when there is outstanding compliance action at the time a
prison admission is processed, it is due to a non-compliance event that:

-   occurred prior to imprisonment, or
-   was reported before payment has been suspended or cancelled due to
    imprisonment

Capability Assessments, compliance investigations and CCAs outstanding when job seeker imprisoned

When a job seeker has been imprisoned, outstanding Capability
Assessments (CA), compliance investigations and Comprehensive Compliance
Assessments (CCA) are not held pending return to payment.

When the Service Officer in the Incarcerated Customer Servicing team
suspends or cancels the payment due to imprisonment and clears the
record, Capability Assessments, compliance investigations and CCAs that
have not been started are automatically finalised by the system.

When a started compliance investigation is not automatically finalised
by background processing, manual intervention by Participation Solutions
Team (PST)-skilled staff with a WNPPD security resource is required.
