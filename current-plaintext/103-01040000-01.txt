This document outlines priority needs for customers of income managed
funds to meet these priority needs and any other expenses.

Priority needs

When a customer’s payments are income managed, they must use their
Income Management account to meet their and their family's priority
needs.

Service Officers should consider the allocation of payment for the
following basic items when assessing a person’s priority needs:

-   School Meals Program (if applicable)
-   food, basic personal hygiene and basic household items
-   housing, for example, rent or loan repayments
-   utilities, for example, electricity, gas, water, sewerage
-   clothing and footwear
-   medical needs

To determine if a person's priority needs are being met, Service
Officers must take into account information available on the customer's
record. For example:

-   accommodation details
-   children in care
-   age of children

They should also consider any voluntary deductions (Centrepay and Rent
Deduction Scheme payments). The customer may elect to change the
voluntary deductions to Income Management expenses or
maintain/vary/cease the deductions.

Priority needs assessment

Service Officers trained in Priority needs assessments should conduct a
Priority needs assessment. Service Officers not trained in Income
Management should seek assistance from:

-   a specialised Service Officer (if available)
-   a Service Support Officer, or
-   the Technical Support Line (select 'Income Management' option) if
    required

Ranking of priority needs

Under Child Protection Income Management (CPIM) and Supporting People at
Risk (SPaR) measures, the referring authority may recommend where income
managed funds should be directed. Social workers who assess a customer
as Vulnerable for Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients (VWPR) Income
Management can also recommend how income managed funds could be
directed.

Service Officers are not required to comply with the recommendation, but
should document how these needs will be met when conducting an
assessment or reviewing a customer's priority needs

Review of Priority Needs

A Service Officer can complete a review of a customers priority needs at
any time throughout the period of Income Management. This is to identify
if there are any changes to their priority needs and Income Management
expenses are updated accordingly. These reviews take place when:

-   a change in the customer's circumstances, for example change of
    address
-   the system raises a Work Item, indicating priority needs must be
    checked
-   the customer requests a review of their priority needs
-   a State or Territory Child Protection Authority requests a review of
    priority needs
-   requests for priority needs expenses do not match the current
    priority needs workflow

Using Income Management funds to pay priority needs

After a Service Officer determines the priority needs of a customer and
their dependents, the customer and Service Officer will discuss and
agree on allocation of the income managed funds. Income managed funds
can be used to pay for priority needs through:

-   payments to third parties, including Third Party Organisations, or
-   BasicsCard - a reusable card which allows customers to use their
    income managed funds to purchase goods and services at approved
    BasicsCard merchants. This is done through the Electronic Funds
    Transfer at Point of Sales (EFTPOS) network

Note: if Services Australia is aware of an unmet priority need of the
customer, their partner, child/ren and/or other dependents, they must
take action to meet this need.

Guiding principles of Income Management

There are 4 guiding principles that should be used in all decisions
about the use of income managed funds.

While Services Australia has authority to make decisions about a
customer's income managed payments, a customer should also have
significant input into these decisions. A key objective of Income
Management is to help customers meet their priority needs

If a customer has funds in their Income Management account and the
agency is aware of an unmet priority need of the customer, their
partner, children and/or other dependents, the agency must take action
to meet that need

Income managed funds cannot be unreasonably withheld from a person. If
current and reasonably foreseeable priority needs have been met and a
customer seeks access to unspent funds (other than for an excluded good
or service), the request cannot be unreasonably refused

If a customer has children, the agency must have regard to the best
interests of those children and/or dependents in deciding how income
managed funds should be used
