This document outlines the aspects of the identification and
investigation of debts.

Debt Management

Debt Management is an important part of Services Australia’s core
business. This is central to achieving customer service, partner agency
and efficiency goals.

It is important the agency services customer accounts:

-   quickly
-   accurately, and
-   in a sensitive manner

Business Partnership Agreement

The Department of Social Services (DSS) and Services Australia have a
Business Partnership Agreement. It contains a framework for:

-   maximising correct payments, and
-   identifying and investigating debts

This framework has three key strategies:

-   Prevention: having systems and procedures in place to minimise the
    risk of incorrect payments. That is, the Debt Management and
    Information System (DMIS)
-   Detection: having processes to quickly detect and fix incorrect
    payments
-   Deterrence: promoting voluntary compliance through public
    recognition of the risks and penalties of attempting to defraud the
    agency. This includes the likelihood of detection, recovery of debts
    and possible prosecution
