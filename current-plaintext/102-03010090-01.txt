This document outlines information on changing the address of a care
recipient when they have moved permanently into residential aged care.

Moving to an aged care home

This information covers when a care recipient enters residential aged
care or moves from one aged care home to another. It does not cover when
a care recipient leaves residential aged care, see Change of address
from an aged care home.

Aged care needs assessment

The Australian Government approves aged care providers to provide care.
To access government funded aged care, a person must be found eligible
through an assessment from an Aged Care Assessment Team. If a person is
not eligible for government funded aged care services, they can access
privately funded care services but will have to pay the full cost
themselves.

Australian Government funded residential aged care

This is care provided to a care recipient assessed as being eligible for
permanent residential aged care and the service is accredited by the
Department of Health and Aged Care. The service advises Services
Australia (the agency) of entry into care or departures from care.

-   The care recipient’s cost of care is determined by an Australian
    National Aged Care Classification (AN-ACC) assessment, see Aged
    Care - Australian National Aged Care Classification (AN-ACC)
-   The care recipient’s contribution to their cost of care is
    determined by a means assessment, see Aged care means assessment

Note: for Respite residential Care, see Temporary change of address to
an aged care home for respite care.

Unfunded residential aged care

This is care provided to a care recipient in permanent residential aged
care and the service place is not accredited through the Department of
Health and Aged Care, and does not receive residential care funding from
the government for that place. General funding may still be provided but
these types of residential aged care providers are not regarded as
funded.

Care recipients in unfunded residential aged care may be eligible to
receive Rent Assistance for accommodation fees charged.

Examples of unfunded care:

Care recipients in an unfunded place (bed) in an aged care service that
has both funded and unfunded places

Multi-Purpose Service (MPS) - a service usually operated by local Health
services in rural and remote communities where it is not viable to
operate separate hospital and aged care services

National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care
Program (NATSIFAC) - flexible and culturally appropriate care for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in rural and remote areas:

-   providers receive funding for the aged care part of their service
    but individual fees and charges are negotiated directly with the
    providers

The Resources page contains links to lists of MPS and NATSIFAC services.

Moving to an aged care home - Temporary care

There are different types of temporary care places:

Respite care

-   Temporary care placement
-   Customers are approved to access up to 63 days of respite care per
    year
-   See Temporary change of address to an aged care home for respite
    care

Short-term restorative care

-   Short term management to reverse or slow down difficulties with
    everyday tasks
-   Can be provided at home, a residential care setting, or both
-   See Short-Term Restorative Care (STRC) Programme

Transitional care

-   Provides short term management for customers after a hospital stay
-   Can be provided at home, a residential care setting, or both
-   See Transition Care Programme

Notifying a change of address to aged care

When a care recipient moves into any type of residential aged care, the
care recipient or correspondence nominee notify the agency that the care
recipient has moved. The requirement to notify does not apply to care
recipients who are self-funded retirees and not in receipt of a payment
or service from the agency.

If the care recipient is currently in receipt of an income support
payment (ISP) they must notify the agency of a change of address within
14 days, including:

name and address of the aged care home

type of residential aged care service (for example, funded or unfunded
residential care)

-   care recipients in unfunded residential aged care such as
    Multi-purpose service, NATSIFAC or nursing home type patient service
    may be eligible to receive Rent Assistance for fees charged, see
    Rent Assistance (RA) for care receivers

whether the care recipient has paid, or agreed to pay any accommodation
costs including a refundable accommodation deposit (RAD) or a refundable
accommodation contribution (RAC), or has transferred (rolled over) an
accommodation bond

date of entry into care

Aged Care data matching occurs when the aged care service notifies the
agency of a care recipient’s entry into a residential aged care place:

-   Name of the aged care home and date of admission will be populated
    onto the RCIRC screen source of these activities will be *RC when
    created automatically
-   Delegation to update a care recipient’s address based on Aged Care
    system information is now APS4 or above (as per item 60 in the Aged
    Care Act 1997 and Accountability Principles 2014 - Delegations
    Instrument). Note: any care recipients who are in receipt of an
    Income Support Payment or concession card will need their home
    address updated

Care recipient receiving ISP was a homeowner before moving to an aged care home

If a care recipient receives an income support payment (ISP) from the
agency and was a homeowner before moving to funded residential aged
care, the care recipient or authorised third party must give the
information below:

-   The value and status of the former principal home when a means
    assessment is required. Note: not needed if a protected person lives
    in the former principal home. See Aged care means assessment -
    protected person for more information
-   Any amount paid as an accommodation bond (pre 1 July 2014),
    refundable accommodation deposit (RAD) or refundable accommodation
    contribution (RAC)
-   The address the care recipient/nominee wants their mail sent to

Rental income received for a care recipient’s former principal home may
be exempt:

for ISP customers who entered permanent residential care before 1
January 2017 (including pre-entry leave), and

-   are renting their former principal home, and
-   are paying their accommodation costs by a periodic payment,
    including when a partial lump sum is paid, then
-   the rental income is exempt from the ISP income test and is included
    in the aged care means assessment (for aged care entries after 1
    January 2016)

for care recipients who entered care before 1 January 2016 (including
pre-entry leave) and have not had a break greater than 28 days, and

-   are renting their former principal home, and
-   are paying their accommodation costs by a periodic payment,
    including when a partial lump sum is paid, then
-   the rental income is exempt from the aged care means assessment to
    determine aged care fees, and exempt from the ISP income test

See Aged Care means assessment - Rental income from principal home for
more information.

Care recipient paid rent before moving to an aged care home

Income support payment (ISP) customers paying rent for accommodation
immediately before entering funded residential aged care are entitled to
receive rent assistance for up to 14 days following their entry into
care.

This only applies if the care recipient is still liable to pay rent for
their previous address following their entry into care.

One or both members of a couple moving to any residential aged care home

If one or both members of a couple enter residential aged care (for
example, aged care home, Multi-purpose service facility, nursing home
type patient in hospital) both partners are considered to be 'illness
separated' even if they move into the same aged care service.

This procedure does not apply for income support payment (ISP) customers
who are moving in to a retirement village.
