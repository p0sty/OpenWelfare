Statutory declarations for change of ownership

Only a Commonwealth statutory declaration is acceptable as evidence to
support a change of practice ownership. Only accept a Commonwealth
statutory declaration if the practice does not have any other supporting
documents to provide.

The completed Commonwealth statutory declaration must include the date
of the sale/transfer of the practice, and effectively set out the
circumstances surrounding the transfer of the practice from one
individual or legal entity to another.
