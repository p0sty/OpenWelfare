|                                   | overpayments only applies where   |
|                                   | the ISP overpayment is a result   |
|                                   | of the customer getting PPL for   |
|                                   | the same past period. This is     |
|                                   | because PPL is treated as         |
|                                   | ordinary income for calculating   |
|                                   | the rate of ISP.                  |

|                                   | If the overpayment amount is      |
|                                   | greater than the arrears amount,  |
|                                   | a debt will be identified. The    |
|                                   | debt shell will auto-allocate to  |
|                                   | the appropriate debt team for     |
