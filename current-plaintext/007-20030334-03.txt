|                                   | overpayments only applies where   |
|                                   | the ISP overpayment is a result   |
|                                   | of the customer getting PPL for   |
|                                   | the same past period. This is     |
|                                   | because PPL is treated as         |
|                                   | ordinary income for calculating   |
|                                   | the rate of ISP.                  |

|                                   | If the overpayment amount is      |
|                                   | greater than the arrears amount,  |
|                                   | a debt will be identified. The    |
|                                   | debt shell will auto-allocate to  |
|                                   | the appropriate debt team for     |

|                                   | If within the activity the        |
|                                   | results are both PPL arrears and  |
|                                   | an overpayment of PPL or an       |
|                                   | overpayment of an income support  |
|                                   | payment (ISP), the system will    |
|                                   | automatically offset these        |
|                                   | amounts. The offset will occur so |
|                                   | a payment does not issue and      |
|                                   | subsequently raise a debt on the  |
|                                   | same day. Note: offsetting for    |
|                                   | ISP overpayments only applies     |
|                                   | where the ISP overpayment is a    |
|                                   | result of the customer getting    |
|                                   | PPL for the same past period.     |
|                                   | This is because PPL is treated as |
|                                   | ordinary income for calculating   |
|                                   | the rate of ISP.                  |

|                                   | If the overpayment amount is      |
|                                   | greater than the arrears amount,  |
|                                   | a debt will be identified. The    |
|                                   | debt shell will auto-allocate to  |
|                                   | the appropriate debt team for     |
|                                   | investigation.                    |
