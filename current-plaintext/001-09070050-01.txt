This document outlines the Services Australia process for approving
self-employment as an approved activity for job seekers who choose to
use their self-employment to fully meet their mutual obligation
requirements.

Services Australia must approve the self-employment approved activity,
regardless of whether the job seeker is managed by Services Australia or
their provider.

Self-employment as an approved activity

All job seekers can choose to participate in self-employment as an
approved activity. This may be added to a job seeker's Job Plan as the
only compulsory activity, if the job seeker is able to fully meet their
mutual obligation requirements by doing enough hours, and declaring
enough business income to satisfy the sufficient work test.

Details are recorded on the job seeker's Activity and Exemption Summary
(AEX) screen where they are fully meeting their mutual obligation
requirements through self-employment.

Job seekers may also use self-employment to meet their Work for the Dole
(WFD) Phase requirements, if the jobactive organisation agrees to it.

New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)

NEIS assists eligible job seekers who wish to establish and run their
own business to become self-supporting. Businesses should be new and be
commercially viable.

The Department of Education, Skills and Employment administer NEIS.
Services Australia should provide job seekers interested in NEIS with
basic information and if already connected to an employment services
provider direct them to their jobactive organisation or Disability
Employment Services (DES) provider for assistance accessing NEIS.

Using the sufficient work test to fully meet mutual obligation requirements

Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements can undertake
self-employment, or a combination of self-employment and other approved
activities, to fully meet their requirements.

The sufficient work test has 2 parts:

-   the minimum hours requirement, and
-   the minimum remuneration requirement

A job seeker must meet both requirements to satisfy the sufficient work
test.

The minimum number of hours for job seekers aged 55 and over, and
principal carer parents is 30 hours per fortnight. For job seekers with
a reduced work capacity, the number of hours depends on their assessed
work capacity.

A person will fully meet their mutual obligation requirements if:

-   the total hours worked is at least the minimum number required for
    the person, and
-   the remuneration from net business income is at least the applicable
    hourly rate (usually the national minimum wage or applicable
    occupation award wage), multiplied by the minimum number of hours
    required for the person

Job seekers who do not satisfy the sufficient work test must be referred
to a jobactive organisation because they cannot fully meet their mutual
obligation requirements through self-employment only.

In these cases, use the sufficient work test to work out the additional
hours of work required. This is assessed as follows:

-   if the amount earned is already sufficient to meet the remuneration
    test, the person must undertake, or look for, at least the number of
    hours required to bring the work up to the minimum hours
    requirement, or
-   if the amount earned is insufficient, the person must look for, or
    undertake, the number of hours required to meet the target
    remuneration amount

Job seekers with full-time requirements - sufficient work test

Job seekers with full-time mutual obligation requirements can use
self-employment to meet their requirements if they satisfy the
sufficient work test as follows:

-   are working at least 35 hours per week (70 hours per fortnight), and
-   have a net business income equal to or above the national minimum
    wage for the minimum number of hours required - 70 hours per
    fortnight at the national minimum wage

Job seekers aged 55 and over - sufficient work test

Job seekers aged 55 and over can use self-employment to fully meet their
mutual obligation requirements if they satisfy the sufficient work test
as follows:

-   are working at least 15 hours per week (30 hours per fortnight), and
-   have a net business income equal to or above the national minimum
    wage for the minimum number of hours required - 30 hours per
    fortnight at the national minimum wage

Job seekers aged 55 and over must still meet the basic qualification for
JobSeeker Payment (JSP) of being available and willing to do other paid
work if it is offered to them, before self-employment is approved as an
activity.

Job seekers with part-time requirements (principal carers) - sufficient work test

Job seekers who are principal carers can use self-employment to fully
meet their mutual obligation requirements if they satisfy the sufficient
work test as follows:

-   are working at least 15 hours per week (30 hours per fortnight), and
-   have a net business income equal to or above the national minimum
    wage for the minimum number of hours required - 30 hours per
    fortnight at the national minimum wage

Note: for principal carers with a dependent child:

-   unless otherwise requested or agreed by the principal carer -
    activities and other mutual obligation requirements should be
    scheduled to occur during school hours (that is, generally between 9
    am and 3 pm during school terms)
-   Mutual obligation requirements can be satisfied with a combination
    of suitable self-employment and other paid work, or approved study
    where activities total a minimum of 15 hours per week (30 hours per
    fortnight)
-   participation in NEIS pre-training and the NEIS program itself can
    be done on a part-time basis, consistent with part-time requirements
    of principal carers, where the job seeker is referred and placed by
    their jobactive organisation

Job seekers with part-time requirements (partial capacity to work (PCW) and temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC)) - sufficient work test

Job seekers assessed as having a PCW (0-7 hours per week or 8-14 hours
per week) or a TRWC (0-7 hours per week or 8-14 hours per week) can use
self-employment to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements if
they satisfy the sufficient work test as follows:

-   are working within the hours for their bandwidth, and
-   have a net business income equal to or above the national minimum
    wage for the number of hours required for their bandwidth

Job seekers assessed as having a PCW (15-29 hours per week) can use
self-employment to fully meet their mutual obligation requirements if
they satisfy the sufficient work test as follows:

-   are working a minimum of 15 hours per week, and
-   have a net business income equal to or above the national minimum
    wage for the number of hours required - 30 hours per fortnight at
    the national minimum wage

Other job seekers with part-time requirements

For Ministers of Religion who are either a principal carer of a
dependent child or a person assessed as having a PCW, and are doing at
least 15 hours of paid pastoral work per week for their religious order,
the amount of remuneration received does not have to be at the national
minimum wage.

Self-employment and Annual Activity Requirements

Self-employment is an approved activity that can be done during the Work
for the Dole (WFD) Phase. The jobactive organisation will manage the
commencement and compliance of the job seeker. Services Australia is
advised when a job seeker has started the WFD Phase, and the start and
end date of the WFD Phase, and their approved activities will display on
the Participation Summary screen.

Services Australia can approve self-employment as an approved activity
for Centrelink managed and provider managed job seekers if the activity
means the job seeker will become or remain Centrelink managed and fully
meet their mutual obligation requirements.

Combinations of activities to meet requirements

If the job seeker does not fully meet their mutual obligation
requirements through self-employment, they can do another approved
activity in combination with their self-employment.

Services Australia can only approve combinations of activities that
include paid employment, that is:

-   part-time work and self-employment
-   study and part-time work, or study and self-employment (for
    principal carers only); or
-   self-employment and voluntary work for job seekers aged 55 and over

Any other combinations of approved activities that include voluntary
work, like voluntary work and part-time study or voluntary work and
self-employment (other than for job seekers aged 55 and over), must be
negotiated between the job seeker and their Employment Services
Provider.

Job seeker meeting mutual obligation requirements with self-employment

If the job seeker’s self-employment fully meets their mutual obligation
requirements, the approved activity must be recorded on the AEX screen
and included in their Job Plan as a compulsory activity. The job seeker
must report and confirm their participation in the activity to keep
getting an income support payment. The job seeker is automatically
suspended from Employment Provider Services and there is no need for
them to discuss this with their Employment Services Provider. However,
if they want to continue to volunteer in Employment Provider Services,
they must discuss this with their provider. Once Employment Provider
Services are suspended, the job seeker will be Centrelink managed.

Requirements not met

Sometimes a job seeker may not complete the specified hours to satisfy
their requirements for the fortnight. Self-employment income does not
need to be declared each fortnight, as it is assessed on an annual
basis, and the assessed self-employment income on their record is to be
used for checking the sufficient work test has been satisfied. The
Service Officer should check if the job seeker has a reasonable excuse
for not meeting the requirements of their Job Plan. The only acceptable
reasonable excuses for not meeting requirements are:

-   a sick child (or children)
-   a cancelled shift
-   a short term reduction in hours due to public holidays
-   pupil-free days, or
-   failure of special disability related transport

There is an expectation working hours will return to normal in the next
fortnight.

In addition, there are strict limits about how often to accept a
reasonable excuse before renegotiating the Job Plan.

A failure to meet the requirements will not lead to compliance action.
Instead, the job seeker should:

-   be referred to an Employment Services Provider
-   negotiate a new Job Plan with their provider

These actions do not stop Service Officers from assessing the job
seeker's circumstances and deciding an exemption from the mutual
obligation requirements is appropriate under any of the approved
categories.

Business operating at a loss

A principal carer job seeker or PCW job seeker may have a viable
business, however it is operating at a loss or below the national
minimum wage due to significant tax deductions available. In these
cases, the income must be assessed as not meeting the job seeker's
mutual obligation requirements for their required number of hours per
fortnight, when calculated against the national minimum wage.

Business income decreases when job seeker overseas

When job seekers are overseas and Services Australia has approved
portability of their payment, they are exempt from mutual obligation
requirements for the approved duration of the absence.

If a job seeker is fully meeting their mutual obligation requirements by
being self-employed, and

-   they are absent overseas for less than 6 weeks, and
-   they recommence business trading at the same level of work or
    greater once they return

maintain the business income assessment that was in place before the
overseas departure, for assessing if the job seeker is fully meeting
mutual obligation requirements and calculating the rate of income
support payable.

Job seekers absent for more than 6 weeks will have their business income
set to zero until they recommence work and a new annualised estimate is
calculated.
