+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Q5                                | Will you be (or are you now)      |
|                                   | studying Year 12, or              |
|                                   | equivalent? + Read more ...       |

|                                   | If a customer has attempted Year  |
|                                   | 12 twice before, and is planning  |
|                                   | to study Year 12 for the third    |
|                                   | attempt, they may not be eligible |
|                                   | to receive assistance.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, the previous attempts at |
|                                   | Year 12 may be disregarded        |
|                                   | depending on the reasons. The     |
|                                   | customer can attach a statement   |
|                                   | as to why they are attempting     |
|                                   | Year 12 for the third time. See   |
|                                   | Disregarding previous study.      |

|                                   | education you have completed? +   |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer has completed a   |
|                                   | course overseas they need to      |
|                                   | advise what the equivalent course |
|                                   | would be in Australia. It is      |
|                                   | important to know what level of   |
|                                   | study the customer has completed, |
|                                   | as this can have a bearing on the |
|                                   | customer's entitlement.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer does not know the |
|                                   | Australian equivalent, collect    |
|                                   | details of the overseas course    |
|                                   | and contact Local Peer Support    |
|                                   | (LPS).                            |

| Q8                                | Have you completed a tertiary     |

|                                   | This question relates to the      |
|                                   | customer's previous study. The    |
|                                   | customer needs to advise:         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the year they commenced       |
|                                   | -   the year they completed the   |
|                                   |     course                        |
|                                   | -   the institution they          |
|                                   |     attended, and                 |
|                                   | -   the name of the course        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Q9                                | Have you started a tertiary       |
|                                   | course but not completed it? +    |

|                                   | This includes study in any        |
|                                   | previous course/s and the         |
|                                   | customer's current course. Both   |
|                                   | full-time and part-time study     |
|                                   | need to be included. If           |
|                                   | part-time, the customer needs to  |
|                                   | provide the details of the        |
|                                   | subjects attempted. If the        |
|                                   | customer failed any subjects due  |
|                                   | to circumstances beyond their     |
|                                   | control, they should attach a     |
|                                   | statement with the reasons. See   |
|                                   | Disregarding previous study.      |

|                                   | If the customer is not sure       |
|                                   | whether they are a full-time or   |
|                                   | part-time student, they should    |
