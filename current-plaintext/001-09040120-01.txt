This document outlines how Service Officers in smart centres and service
centres can assist a job seeker who is attempting to report for payment
by IVR or online and an outstanding compliance action exists.

Re-engagement with provider required

Outstanding participation-related payment suspensions prevent reporting
being finalised until the required action has been completed.

To prompt timely re-engagement and decision making, Services Australia
must:

-   check which job seeker compliance system applies to the job seeker
    and the participation suspension reason, and
-   appropriately direct the job seeker to their provider or the
    Participation Solutions Team (PST)

Contact with Services Australia to discuss compliance action

Outstanding compliance actions, including a Comprehensive Compliance
Assessment (CCA) or Capability Assessment (CA), will prevent a job
seeker from finalising their report. Where contact with the
Participation Solutions Team (PST) is required before generating payment
and the job seeker attempts to report via:

-   [] self service online or Express Plus, they are advised to contact
    the PST
-   phone self service, job seekers will be transferred directly to the
    PST or Smart Centre Call as appropriate during business hours
-   personal or telephone reporting, an issue will display on the job
    seekers record to identify that they need to contact the PST

Note: job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework can
choose to accept the financial penalty for certain mutual obligation
failures without discussing it with PST staff. If the job seeker wishes
to discuss the failure with PST, they will need to do so before
finalising their report.

The Resources page contains contact details for the Participation
Solutions Team (PST).
