Disease Phases

CML is categorised into chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast
crisis.

The different phases of disease have different restrictions for PBS
subsidy.

Chronic Phase is further split into lines of treatment:

A patient starts as first line treatment and can choose to commence on
imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib.

-    A patient who swaps treatment due to toxicity remains in 'first
    line' treatment

Second and third line treatment includes dasatinib and nilotinib.

Asciminib and ponatinib sits outside the lines of treatment and are
available to patients after failure or toxicity to treatment

Untreated patients may commence imatinib in the accelerated phase or
blast crisis. The patient's disease may improve with treatment and maybe
reclassified into the chronic phase of treatment.
