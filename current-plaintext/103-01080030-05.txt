|                                   | Bev has two dependent children    |
|                                   | and was granted an exemption from |
|                                   | Income Management on the 7th of   |
|                                   | May after meeting all relevant    |
|                                   | criteria under the responsible    |
|                                   | parenting category.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On the 25th of August, the        |
|                                   | dependent children leave Bev's    |
|                                   | care to live with Roy (the other  |
|                                   | parent). As Bev has no dependent  |
|                                   | children in care, the exemption   |
|                                   | can be reviewed and ended. Bev    |
|                                   | can still apply for an exemption  |
|                                   | under the participation in        |

|                                   | 12 months. Barnaby is still       |
