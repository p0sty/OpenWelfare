|                                   | ABSTUDY on 21 March 2023. Within  |
|                                   | the claim, Jarrah selects the     |
|                                   | independence criterion based on   |
|                                   | undertaking approved agricultural |
|                                   | work.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On initial assessment, Jarrah     |
|                                   | cannot be approved under this     |
|                                   | criterion as the claim was        |
|                                   | submitted after the criterion     |
|                                   | closing date of 1 March 2023, and |
|                                   | more than 14 days past the        |
|                                   | initial contact date.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, due to being             |
|                                   | hospitalised on 21 February 2023, |
|                                   | Jarrah was not able to lodge the  |
|                                   | claim within 14 days of the       |
|                                   | initial contact. Jarrah supplies  |
|                                   | medical evidence so that a        |
|                                   | medical condition extension can   |
|                                   | be applied.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jarrah's claim for ABSTUDY,       |
|                                   | including the request for         |
|                                   | independence based on undertaking |
|                                   | approved agricultural work, can   |
|                                   | now be assessed from 20 February  |
|                                   | 2023 as long as all other         |
