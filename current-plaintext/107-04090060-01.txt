Waivers for the 2000-01 income year

The $1,000 waiver applies to the 2000-2001 reconciliation year. This was
the first year of the new Family Tax System. The waiver helped families
adjust to the changes.

Legislation specific to the 2000-01 financial year allowed Services
Australia to waive the first:

-   $1,000 of a customer's FTB debt and
-   $1,000 of a customer's CCB debt

The $1,000 waiver provision applied automatically at reconciliation for
debts of:

-   FTB paid as instalments during 2000-01
-   FTB paid as a combination of instalments and a past period claim via
    the ATO or the agency for 2000-01
-   CCB received as reduced child care fees during 2000-01

Some customers received a percentage of the full FTB rate for a child
(shared care and blended family customers). They are entitled to the
full $1,000 waiver. Individually, if it applies to their debt.

The Resources page contains examples of how the $1,000 waiver applies to
FTB and CCB reconciliation debts.

Q418 re-reconciliation advice (historical)

Customers must receive notice of a debt.

Letters did not automatically issue for some records. This occurred when
re-reconciliation was manually completed. Some customers would not be
aware of their re-reconciliation result, or entitlement to the one-off
$1,000 waiver.

A manual Q418 letter was created to ensure customers were aware of all
information relating to their reconciliation for 2000-2001.

A Q418 letter included:

-   debt details and
-   special arrangements introduced including
-   the transitional $1,000 waiver

For debts of more than $50 and the debtor is not receiving Centrelink
payments, an Interest Charge (IC) applies. The existing
re-reconciliation letters should include an IC warning message. The IC
is to encourage people to repay their outstanding debts in a timely
fashion.

An IC applies to their debt, after the debt due date. If they have not
repaid the amount in full or made an acceptable payment arrangement.
Interest adds daily until receipt of a payment. They must keep making
the agreed repayments until the outstanding debt is paid.

For further information, see Interest Charge (IC) for Centrelink debtors
no longer receiving payments.

When a Q999 manual free text letter is required

The Q418 was not suitable in all cases. A manual free text letter (Q999)
was used. The Q999 needed to include all mandatory information for the
following debts:

Family Assistance Office (FAO):

-   circumstance overpayments for the 2000-2001 financial year
-   raised prior to reconciliation and
-   where customers may have requested a review or
-   it may have been held pending the passage of the $1,000 waiver
    legislation

Re-reconciliation overpayments where:

-   an overpayment existed before the re-reconciliation and
-   it was more than $1,049.99 and
-   the recalculated overpayment before waiver action, is less than $50

For overpayments that occur after re-reconciliation where:

-   there has been a waiver applied to the original reconciliation
    overpayment with
-   a reason code other than TWF, TWC, IFR or LTF
