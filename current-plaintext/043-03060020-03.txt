|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | accounts (for example, working    |

|                                   |     to base the assessment of the |
|                                   |     likely current income         |
|                                   |     received by a customer from a |

|                                   |     other reduction in income,    |
|                                   |     ask the customer to provide   |
|                                   |     an interim Profit and Loss    |
