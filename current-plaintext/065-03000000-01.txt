This document outlines information about Age Pension and other
assistance available to older Australians.

Government intent

The Australian Government, via Services Australia, provides Age Pension
to eligible older Australians who cannot fully fund their own retirement
through retirement savings.

The rate of Age Pension depends on the person's circumstances and
includes incentives for people to maximise their overall income

To qualify for Age Pension a person must meet a set of criteria
including age and Australian residence requirements. Age Pension is also
subject to income and an assets tests. Claimants who qualify for Age
Pension also have access to a range of concessions.

Age Pension claims and transfers

[] The preferred option is for customers to claim using their Centrelink
online account. A Service Officer is to run Assisted Customer Claim
(ACC) with customers who are unable or unwilling to claim online.

Income support payment customers approaching Age Pension age are invited
to complete an online transfer to Age Pension or to return the
customised form.
