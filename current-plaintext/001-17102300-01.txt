This document outlines RapidConnect exemptions that may be applied to
job seekers claiming JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA)
(job seeker).

RapidConnect

RapidConnect is a referral process that gives job seekers early access
to employment assistance through an Employment Services Provider.
Registration with a suitable provider must be completed before the job
seeker's claim for income support is finalised.

Job seekers who are not subject to RapidConnect, will be referred to a
provider at the earliest possible contact once circumstances have
changed or once a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) or Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) has been completed.

RapidConnect exemptions

Job seekers claiming JSP or YA (job seeker) who are not subject to
RapidConnect will have their exemption applied during the Participation
Interview.

RapidConnect manual exemptions can be applied during the Participation
Interview depending on the customers circumstances. See the Process page
for information on manual RapidConnect exemptions.

Job seekers may provide information during the Participation Interview
to qualify for a RapidConnect exemption. Depending on the job seeker's
circumstances, Service Officers can select a valid reason to manually
exempt the job seeker in the workflow. Evidence for the reason may be
required. See the Process page for information on manual RapidConnect
exemptions and evidence required.

If a job seeker's circumstances change after the Participation Interview
has been completed and they now qualify for a RapidConnect exemption,
manually record the exemption via the Job Seeker RapidConnect (JMRC)
page.

Note: all staff can code a RapidConnect exemption from today’s date
(date of receipt). The backdating of a RapidConnect exemption can only
be coded by an APS5 or above. Smart Centre staff should contact their
local Service Support Officer or team leader where backdating is
required.

RapidConnect exemption - medical reasons

A RapidConnect exemption for medical reasons applies to job seekers:

-   with a temporary incapacity for all work, with their condition
    verified by medical evidence. See Item 1 in the Manually applied
    RapidConnect exemptions table
-   claiming JSP or YA (job seeker) provisional pending determination of
    a Disability Support Pension (DSP) claim
-   who require a Job Seeker Snapshot initiated Job Capacity Assessment
    (JCA) except where it is a Personal Factors only JCA
-   who are expectant mothers within 13 weeks prior to their expected
    due date. See Item 2 in the Manually applied RapidConnect exemptions
    table

RapidConnect exemption - other program or activity more suitable

A RapidConnect exemption applies where another program or activity is
more suitable for:

YA (job seeker) who indicates it is unreasonable to live at home. See
Item 3 in the Manually applied RapidConnect exemptions table

job seekers aged 21 years or under and potentially eligible for a
referral to 1 of the following Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations or Department of Home Affairs programs:

-   undertaking a combination of approved youth activities. See Item 4
    in the Manually applied RapidConnect exemptions table

and are RapidConnect exempt, must still be connected to the relevant
Employment Services Provider.

RapidConnect exemption - principal carers

Job seekers who are principal carers of a dependent child are registered
as a Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No Remote Referral Required
(NRRR) job seeker during the Participation Interview if they are:

-   meeting their mutual obligation requirements by undertaking suitable
    paid work or self-employment of at least 30 hours per fortnight
-   RapidConnect exempt and
-   do not require referral to a provider

Job seekers transferring from Parenting Payment (PP) to JSP or YA
(other) as principal carers who are already subject to compulsory mutual
obligation requirements, are exempt from the RapidConnect process. They
are still required to be linked to an employment services provider and
attend appointments.

See Item 5 in the Manually applied RapidConnect exemptions table for
keying procedures where a PP job seeker is continuing with a course of
study:

-   if they were receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
    immediately before transferring to JSP/YA as a principal carer, PES
    continues to be payable until the end of the course
-   are still registered as FEP/RFE and may be linked to an Employment
    Services Provider
-   can have an appointment made with a provider using the Online Diary
    if they volunteer for employment services

Note: these job seekers can choose to participate on a voluntary basis
with an Employment Services Provider and will be registered as a Fully
Eligible Participant (FEP)/Remote Fully Eligible (RFE) and linked to a
provider.

RapidConnect exemption - partial capacity to work (PCW)

A RapidConnect exemption automatically applies to job seekers:

with a PCW who are meeting their mutual obligation requirements by
undertaking suitable paid work of 15 hours per week. See Job seekers
with a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity

JSP or YA (job seeker) transferring from transitional Disability Support
Pension (DSP) with a PCW undertaking study at the time of transfer can
continue that course of study until its completion, and:

-   must be continuing to study in the same course they started while
    receiving DSP to be considered for this exemption
-   if they were receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
    immediately before transferring to JSP or YA as a person assessed as
    having a partial capacity to work, PES continues to be payable until
    the end of the course

with a PCW of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week. They may request to volunteer
for employment services for additional services

RapidConnect exemption - temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC)

Job seekers with a Temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of 0-7 or 8-14
hours per week will be exempt from RapidConnect automatically for the
duration of their reduced work capacity.

If they are already linked to a provider, the job seeker will be
suspended from employment services for the duration of their reduced
work capacity. They can request to volunteer for employment services to
receive additional support during their TRWC period.

Note: TRWC 0-7 hours per week job seekers are not able to volunteer in
Disability Employment Services (DES) for the duration of their reduced
capacity.

RapidConnect exemption - early school leavers

Job seekers claiming YA (job seeker) aged 22 or under with no Year 12 or
equivalent qualification are identified as early school leavers (ESL).

If the job seeker is identified as potentially eligible for referral to
1 of the following programs, they are exempt from RapidConnect:

-   Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)
-   Adult Migrants English Program (AMEP)
-   approved youth activities

These job seekers require connection to a provider as soon as possible.

If the job seeker is already undertaking one of the above programs that
fully meets their mutual obligation requirements, register the job
seeker as Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No Remote Referral
Required (NRRR) jobseeker. See Item 4 in the Manually applied
RapidConnect exemptions table.

RapidConnect exemption - students transferring to a job seeker payment

Students transferring from Austudy or YA (student/trainee) to JSP/YA
(job seeker) and who are within 4 weeks of their Student End Date will
be automatically exempt from RapidConnect.

In some cases, students are offered a 'Course End date task' in their
Centrelink Online Account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app up to 28
days prior to losing qualification for Austudy or YA (student/trainee).
The task will allows the student to book an appointment to transfer from
Student to Jobseeker and if required claim JSP via a streamlined
process. See Student to job seeker transfers.

RapidConnect exemption - experiencing a crisis

A RapidConnect exemption for a crisis (CRI) reason is applied during the
Participation Interview when the customer has submitted their JSP/YA
(job seeker) new claim due to crisis. See Item 6 in the Manually applied
RapidConnect exemptions table for examples.

A manual CRI exemption screen can be applied to the JRMC screen during a
subsequent contact.
