This document outlines RapidConnect exemptions that may be applied to
job seekers claiming JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA)
(job seeker).

RapidConnect

RapidConnect is a referral process that gives job seekers early access
to employment assistance through an Employment Services Provider.
Registration with a suitable provider must be completed before the job
seeker's claim for income support is finalised.

Job seekers who are not subject to RapidConnect, will be referred to a
provider at the earliest possible contact once circumstances have
changed or once a Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) or Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) has been completed.

RapidConnect exemptions

Job seekers claiming JSP or YA (job seeker) who are not subject to
RapidConnect will have their exemption applied during the Participation
Interview.

RapidConnect manual exemptions can be applied during the Participation
Interview depending on the customers circumstances. See the Process page
for information on manual RapidConnect exemptions.

Job seekers may provide information during the Participation Interview
to qualify for a RapidConnect exemption. Depending on the job seeker's
circumstances, Service Officers can select a valid reason to manually
exempt the job seeker in the workflow. Evidence for the reason may be
required. See the Process page for information on manual RapidConnect
exemptions and evidence required.

If a job seeker's circumstances change after the Participation Interview
has been completed and they now qualify for a RapidConnect exemption,
manually record the exemption via the Job Seeker RapidConnect (JMRC)
page.

Note: all staff can code a RapidConnect exemption from today’s date
(date of receipt). The backdating of a RapidConnect exemption can only
be coded by an APS5 or above. Smart Centre staff should contact their
local Service Support Officer or team leader where backdating is
required.

RapidConnect exemption - medical reasons

A RapidConnect exemption for medical reasons applies to job seekers:

-   with a temporary incapacity for all work, with their condition
    verified by medical evidence. See Item 2 in Table 2
-   claiming JSP or YA (job seeker) provisional pending determination of
    a Disability Support Pension (DSP) claim
-   who require a Job Seeker Snapshot initiated Job Capacity Assessment
    (JCA) except where it is a Personal Factors only JCA
-   who are expectant customers within 13 weeks prior to their expected
    due date. See Item 3 in Table 2

RapidConnect exemption - other program or activity more suitable

A RapidConnect exemption applies where another program or activity is
more suitable for:

YA (job seeker) who indicates it is unreasonable to live at home, see
Item 4 in Table 2. Job seekers aged 21 years or under and potentially
eligible for a referral to one of the following Department of Employment
and Workplace Relations or Department of Home Affairs programs:

-   Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)
-   Adult Migrants English Program (AMEP)
-   undertaking a combination of approved youth activities. See Item 5
    in Table 2

job seekers with a current and valid Employment Services Assessment
(ESAt) that recommends Disability Employment Services (DES)

Note: job seekers who have been identified for a referral to a program
and are RapidConnect exempt, must still be connected to the relevant
Employment Services Provider.

RapidConnect exemption - principal carers

Job seekers who are principal carers of a dependent child are registered
as a Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No Remote Referral Required
(NRRR) job seeker during the Participation Interview if they are:

-   meeting their mutual obligation requirements by undertaking suitable
    paid work or self-employment of at least 30 hours per fortnight
-   RapidConnect exempt and
-   do not require referral to a provider

Job seekers transferring from Parenting Payment (PP) to JSP or YA
(other) as principal carers who are already subject to compulsory mutual
obligation requirements, are exempt from the RapidConnect process. They
are still required to be linked to an employment services provider and
attend appointments.

See Item 6 in Table 2 for keying procedures where a PP job seeker is
continuing with a course of study:

-   if they were receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
    immediately before transferring to JSP/YA as a principal carer, PES
    continues to be payable until the end of the course
-   are still registered as FEP/RFE and may be linked to an Employment
    Services Provider
-   can have an appointment made with a provider using the Online Diary
    if they volunteer for employment services

Note: these job seekers can choose to participate on a voluntary basis
with an Employment Services Provider and will be registered as a Fully
Eligible Participant (FEP)/Remote Fully Eligible (RFE) and linked to a
provider.

RapidConnect exemption - partial capacity to work (PCW)

A RapidConnect exemption automatically applies to job seekers:

with a PCW who are meeting their mutual obligation requirements by
undertaking suitable paid work of 15 hours per week. See Job seekers
with a partial capacity to work or a temporary reduced work capacity

JSP or YA (job seeker) transferring from transitional Disability Support
Pension (DSP) with a PCW undertaking study at the time of transfer can
continue that course of study until its completion, and:

-   must be continuing to study in the same course they started while
    receiving DSP to be considered for this exemption
-   if they were receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES)
    immediately before transferring to JSP or YA as a person assessed as
    having a partial capacity to work, PES continues to be payable until
    the end of the course

with a PCW of 0-7 or 8-14 hours per week. They may request to volunteer
for employment services for additional services

RapidConnect exemption - temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC)

Job seekers with a Temporary reduced work capacity (TRWC) of 0-7 or 8-14
hours per week will be exempt from RapidConnect automatically for the
duration of their reduced work capacity.

If they are already linked to a provider, the job seeker will be
suspended from employment services for the duration of their reduced
work capacity. They can request to volunteer for employment services to
receive additional support during their TRWC period.

Note: TRWC 0-7 hours per week job seekers are not able to volunteer in
Disability Employment Services (DES) for the duration of their reduced
capacity.

RapidConnect exemption - early school leavers

Job seekers claiming YA (job seeker) aged 22 or under with no Year 12 or
equivalent qualification are identified as early school leavers (ESL).

If the job seeker is identified as potentially eligible for referral to
1 of the following programs, they are exempt from RapidConnect:

-   Skills for Education and Employment (SEE)
-   Adult Migrants English Program (AMEP)
-   approved youth activities

These job seekers require connection to a provider as soon as possible.

If the job seeker is already undertaking one of the above programs that
fully meets their mutual obligation requirements, register the job
seeker as Job Seeker Registration Only (JSRO)/No Remote Referral
Required (NRRR) jobseeker. See Item 5 in Table 2.

RapidConnect exemption - students transferring to a job seeker payment

Students transferring from Austudy or YA (student/trainee) to JSP/YA
(job seeker) and who are within 4 weeks of their Student End Date will
be automatically exempt from RapidConnect.

In some cases, students are offered a 'Course End date task' in their
Centrelink Online Account or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app up to 28
days prior to losing qualification for Austudy or YA (student/trainee).
The task will allows the student to book an appointment to transfer from
Student to Jobseeker and if required claim JSP via a streamlined
process. See Student to job seeker transfers.

RapidConnect exemption - experiencing a crisis

A RapidConnect exemption for a crisis (CRI) reason is applied during the
Participation Interview when the customer has submitted their JSP/YA
(job seeker) new claim due to crisis. See Item 7 in Table 2 for
examples.

A manual CRI exemption can be applied to the Job Seeker RapidConnect
(JRMC) screen during a subsequent contact.

RapidConnect exemption – Already Connected to Provider (ACP)

A RapidConnect exemption of ‘already connected to provider’ (ACP) reason
is applied during the Participation Interview when:

-   the job seeker is connected to Workforce Australia Provider Services
    or Transition to Work
-   are currently a volunteer, and
-   whose most recent Provider Referral Information status is Commenced
    or Suspended

This rule also applies to job seekers in Community Development Regions
who are currently connected to a Community Development Program provider
(CDP) whose most recent Provider Referral Information status is
Commenced or Suspended.

The RapidConnect exemption will not apply for one of the following
reasons:

-   a 3rd mutual obligation failure, work refusal or unemployment
    failure has been imposed (CAN/TCP, CAN/TCU)
-   not entering a Job Plan (CAN/FSA)
-   not contacting their provider within 29 days (JSCM NAR related
    cancellation) (CAN/DCP), or
-   not re-engaging with their provider within 29 days of being asked to
    do so (CAN/CDR)

Note: due to current system limitations, the 'Already connected to
provider' ACP exemption is not always applying correctly to job seekers
in Workforce Australia Online services. A manual RapidConnect exemption
can be granted if they meet the criteria in Step 4 of Table 3.

RapidConnect exemption – Allowable Break (AWB)

A RapidConnect exemption of allowable break (AWB) will be given to a job
seeker who reclaims a JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA)
jobseeker within 13 weeks of cancellation. This exemption will apply if
the job seeker had commenced with a Workforce Australia Services
provider, Workforce Australia Transition to Work provider or Community
Development Program provider.

The RapidConnect exemption will not apply for one of the following
reasons:

-   a 3rd mutual obligation failure, work refusal or unemployment
    failure has been imposed (CAN/TCP, CAN/TCU)
-   not entering a Job Plan (CAN/FSA)
-   not contacting their provider within 29 days (JSCM NAR related
    cancellation) (CAN/DCP), or
-   not re-engaging with their provider within 29 days of being asked to
    do so (CAN/CDR)

Note: due to current system limitations, the allowable break is not
always applying correctly to job seekers in Workforce Australia Online
services. A manual RapidConnect exemption can be granted if they meet
the criteria in Step 4 of Table 3.

RapidConnect exempt but required to be connected to provider

The following list includes job seekers who are RapidConnect exempt but
still required to be connected to a provider and have the initial
appointment booked at the earliest possible contact:

-   mature age 55+ job seekers satisfying their mutual obligation
    requirements by doing at least 30 hours per fortnight of approved
    voluntary work and/or paid work
-   mature age job seekers aged 55-59 years in the first 12 months of
    their current payment, satisfying the mutual obligation requirements
    by doing at least 30 hours per fortnight of approved voluntary and
    paid work, with a minimum of 15 hours per fortnight of paid work or
    self-employment (auto exemption)
-   job seeker who may be subject to a liquid assets waiting period
-   job seekers with income and assets over the allowable limit
-   in crisis if Vulnerable Youth (VY)/Vulnerable Youth (student)
    (VY(s)) flagged
-   unreasonable to Live at Home if VY/VY(s) flagged for job seeker

Manual exemption workaround process

Some job seekers, including job seekers who were previously cancelled
for reasons ‘Customer failed to re-engage’ (CDR) and ‘Did not contact
provider to re-engage' (DCP), may require a manual exemption from the
RapidConnect process due to circumstances outside their control. See
Table 3.
