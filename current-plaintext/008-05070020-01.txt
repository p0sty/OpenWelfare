This document outlines how to restore Mobility Allowance (MOB) after it
has been suspended or cancelled. It also explains the shortened reclaim
process when a customer requalifies for MOB after an exemption from
their mutual obligation requirements for JobSeeker Payment (JSP),
Parenting Payment (PP) or Youth Allowance (YA) (job seeker) expires.

Restoration of MOB

Restoration of MOB without a claim may be appropriate when a customer’s
payment is suspended or cancelled.

A claim is required if MOB is cancelled for the reason:

whereabouts unknown, or

specific portability reason codes

-   Extension Period Overseas Ended (EPE)
-   Customer Gone Overseas Without Notifying (GWN/GWR), or
-   Customer Overseas for 6 weeks (O6W)

Payment can be restored if:

-   it was suspended for one of the previous codes (above)
-   the date of suspension is within 13 weeks, and
-   no other circumstances have changed

When a suspension action is followed by a cancellation:

-   the customer is cancelled from the date of suspension, and
-   any restoration action will proceed as a restoration from
    cancellation.

If MOB has been suspended, the payment can be restored once the reason
for the suspension has been resolved (for example, the forms have been
lodged or new address details given).

Note: a customer can continue to receive MOB at the higher rate if all
of the following apply:

-   their Disability Support Pension (DSP), Parenting Payment (PP),
    JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (job seeker) was
    cancelled (or suspended if DSP) due to employment income or an
    increase in hours worked
-   they continue to work 15 hours or more per week
-   they continue to satisfy the basic eligibility criteria for MOB, and
-   they do not receive any other income support payment

The customer must provide evidence of the current activity before MOB
can be restored if:

-   MOB is in a Period of Grace (POG), and
-   the customer has recommenced or changed their qualifying activity

Evidence must be supplied before cessation of the POG. Otherwise, MOB
will be cancelled and the customer will need to reclaim MOB. Evidence
can be a letter from the employer with the relevant details:

Mobility Allowance: Verification of work (including voluntary work), and

-   looking for work activities (MA005E), or
-   Mobility Allowance: Verification of training (MA005T)

For more information about the POG, see Cancellation and Period of Grace
for Mobility Allowance (MOB).

Whereabouts unknown

If MOB has been suspended or cancelled whereabouts unknown (WUK):

Payment can be restored with arrears if the customer has stayed eligible
for MOB for the time they were suspended/cancelled.

Payment can be restored even when the customer contacts more than 13
weeks after the decision to suspend or cancel.

-   Customers are considered not to have received advice of the decision
    to suspend/cancel, as they were not at their known address and/or
    advice of the decision was returned to Services Australia.

The date of effect of therestoration resulting from review of the
decision to suspend/cancel is the date of the original decision (date of
suspension/cancellation) - see the References page.

Each customer’s circumstances must be reviewed to decide if:

-   their circumstances would have meant they received advice of the
    decision to suspend/cancel,
-   they stayed eligible during the period, and
-   they may be eligible to receive arrears when restored
