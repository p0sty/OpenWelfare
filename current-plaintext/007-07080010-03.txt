|                                   | For a Parental Leave Pay (PPL)    |
|                                   | claim, customers must meet the    |
|                                   | PPL income test to be eligible    |
|                                   | for PPL. All customers claiming   |
|                                   | PPL must provide an estimate of   |
|                                   | their ATI for the financial year  |
|                                   | before the date of claim or the   |
|                                   | date the child was born or        |
|                                   | entered care, whichever is        |
|                                   | earlier.                          |

|                                   | For children born or adopted      |
|                                   | before 1 July 2023, the PPL       |
|                                   | income test is based on the       |
|                                   | estimate of the customer’s income |
|                                   | only, and does not include their  |
|                                   | partner’s income estimate.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Secondary and tertiary claimants  |
|                                   | need to give an estimate when     |
|                                   | they claim PPL. For example,      |
|                                   | after the primary claimant        |
|                                   | returns to work, or after the     |
|                                   | death of the primary              |
|                                   | carer/claimant.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For children born or adopted on   |
|                                   | or after 1 July 2023, a family    |
|                                   | income test may apply, in         |
|                                   | addition to the individual income |
|                                   | test. If the customer does not    |
|                                   | meet the individual income test,  |
|                                   | then the family income test limit |
|                                   | is applied. This applies to both  |
|                                   | single and partnered customers.   |

|                                   | The customer's estimate must be   |
|                                   | considered reasonable for it to   |
