Before making updates, verify the correct record is selected using Proof
of Record Ownership. This will reduce the risk of fraud and creating
multiple and intertwined records.

This document outlines how to change the legal name of a customer or a
child under 18 in the customer's care.

Note: alternate arrangements for customers requesting to change their
legal name are available only for those affected by a current natural
disaster emergency management event.

Circumstances when a legal name change may be requested

A customer can request a name change:

-   If their relationship status has changed. For example, they have
    partnered or separated
-   Gender expression - to align with their affirmed gender
-   Where a child (under 18) is assuming a parent's family name
    Note: written consent from the other parent or a court order is
    required
-   To protect themselves from a third party by changing all reference
    to their current name
-   Where they have chosen to legally change their name for personal
    reasons
-   Where an unnamed newborn child has now been named
    Note: the child's name will have been recorded as 'Newborn'
-   To correct spelling errors

If the customer asks to change their Preferred Name, Also Known As
(AKA), Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Traditional Name, see
Aliases and other names (legal, preferred, sex and gender diverse
customers, cultural considerations etc.).

Sex and gender diverse customers

The term 'preferred name' can cause distress for some people.

For example, when a customer is undertaking a gender transition, or
identity affirmation process, they may find the term 'preferred name'
offensive. As part of their gender identity affirmation, a person may
use their affirmed name due to costs associated with changing a legal
name. Customers may use their affirmed name before progressing to
updating it legally.

A customer can provide their affirmed name and title. Staff can update
the affirmed name and title without a supporting document using the
preferred name field.

A customer can request that we do not use a courtesy title such as Miss,
Mr, Mx or Mrs.

Services Australia is committed to applying the Australian Government
Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender. See the Resources page
for a link. Consult with your team leader if you need further guidance
in supporting sex and gender diverse customers.

Legal name

A customer’s legal name appears in all written and online communication.
Where a customer has a preferred name, this will be used when speaking
with them.

If the customer asks to change their legal name, they must provide in
person, one of the following original and unaltered supporting documents
issued by Births, Deaths and Marriages (BDM):

-   Australian Marriage certificate - Australian ceremonial certificates
    are not acceptable
-   Certificate of Name Change
-   Birth certificate - to support a child's legal (LGL) name
-   Reissued birth certificate in the new name

Note: customers who marry in Australia can take their partners name, or
both can choose to hyphenate their surnames. An Australian Marriage
certificate is sufficient evidence for this change.

Legal name prior to marriage

-   If the customer requests to change their married legal name back to
    their birth or maiden name, and this name was coded as a historical
    legal name on the Customer Person Details Summary (CPDS) screen, no
    supporting evidence is required
-   Original, unaltered supporting evidence must be supplied if the
    customer’s birth or maiden name has never been coded as their legal
    name

Change of name overseas/non-citizen change of name

Staff must refer these change of name requests to the Customer Details
Helpdesk. Documents should be uploaded or scanned to the customer’s
record.

-   Australian citizens who travel overseas to get married will need to
    contact their relevant Birth, Deaths and Marriages to change their
    name. The Certificate of Name change, or a birth certificate issued
    in the new name can then be used as the supporting document to
    update their legal name
-   Australian citizens who are born overseas and live overseas and
    become married or partnered overseas, may request to have their
    Australian Passport re-issued when they are overseas in their
    married name. When these customers ‘return’ to Australia and ask to
    change their legal name, they must provide an Australian Passport
    (verified) and foreign marriage certificate when an Australian
    equivalent certificate is not available
-   Australian Visa holders (non-Australian citizens) who ask to change
    their legal name must provide a foreign passport with a current
    Australian Visa (verified) in their new name. They should also
    provide a document (Australian or foreign) linking the new name to
    their previous name, such as marriage certificate or change of name
    certificate

Note: supporting documents must be presented in person and be original
and unaltered.

Single names

When a customer uses only one name (or multiple first names with no
surname), ask for evidence of its use in the community. For example,
documents issued by other institutions and agencies that use the single
name.

Record the single name in the Family name: field on the CPDS screen.
Leave other name fields blank.

Note: for Identity Confirmation purposes, only record the name displayed
in the Family Name: field in the Identity Confirmation Dashboard.

When a customer's child is legally known by only one name, a system
workaround is currently in place for coding the single name. Record the
single name in both the Family name: and First name: fields the on the
Change Child (CCH) screen. This will ensure the child's name displays
correctly on written correspondence.

Accurate recording of names

Recording accurate name variations and aliases on a customer's record
helps:

-   Reduce fraud - a customer can change names an unlimited number of
    times
    Note: numerous name changes may indicate an intention to defraud.
    Report Suspected Fraud, where suspected
-   Improve data match results - for example, obtain correct visa and
    travel details between the Department of Home Affairs and the agency
-   Effective operation of the Department of Home Affairs datalink. The
    datalink locates travel records for children travelling on a
    parent's passport. It is only effective if agency records contain
    exact spelling of customer and child names
-   Reduce the risk of multiple and intertwined records

Names that contain hyphens or apostrophes must not contain spaces. For
example, coding 'Anne-Maree' as ‘Anne – Maree' means it will not be
found when searching for a record.

Straightforward corrections

Straightforward corrections to names can be actioned at the first point
of contact. These updates include spelling corrections or names recorded
in incorrect order. See Customer's name incorrectly recorded.

myGov Profiles

A legal name update to one myGov member service will not flow to another
member service. The customer is required to change or update their legal
name directly with each member service. See Using myGov accounts.

Alternate service arrangements for customers affected by Emergency Events

Alternate arrangements are in place for customers who are unable to
attend a service centre in person if they are affected by a current
natural disaster emergency management event
