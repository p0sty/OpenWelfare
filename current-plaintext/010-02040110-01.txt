facto relationship for at least 6 months.

Independence criteria

Students and Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they are in a de facto relationship for at least 6
months.

relationship. Students and Australian Apprentices must notify any
changes to their circumstances within 14 days of the change.
