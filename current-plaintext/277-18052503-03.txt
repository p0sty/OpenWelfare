Check and Update WA ex-nuptial indicators

This table describes the process steps to:

check for WA ex-nuptial ‘Child Support Periods’ for all staff, and

manually update WA ex-nuptial case indicators for Service Recovery
trained staff only:

-   Where possible, update WA ex-nuptial indicators before doing any
    other action on these cases. Cuba will apply the correct legislation
    for newly keyed, updated and future changes and reduce associated
    service recovery requirements

Process a care decision

After pending a care record, a care decision needs to be made and the
care change finalised. To complete the process, customer contact and/or
information gathering may be required. Where a customer notifies of a
care change before 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial
customers), see Notification of change in child support care before 1
July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases) This has more details on
making the most appropriate care decision based on the evidence
received. Note: Integrated Care Service Officers must see Integrated
Care.

Add a disputed care record

Disputed care decisions are made by officers in:

-   Integrated Care
-   Personalised Services
-   Complaints
-   Objections
-   Restricted Access Customers - RACS levels 2 and 3

Service Officers must be authorised to make disputed care decisions.
Consult with an authorised officer and obtain relevant approvals when
making the decision.

Authorised Officers who do not dual-code in Child Support and Centrelink
systems must refer disputed care decisions to Integrated Care for
dual-coding. This lets Services Australia provide these customers with a
holistic service and make sure assessment correctness across programs.
See the Customer Referral Guidelines for details.

Steps to add a pending record where care is disputed

Table 4: this table describes how to create and process a disputed care
record for a child of a case. Both the child and case must have existing
Cuba records.

Note: only update a Centrelink care record in Cuba manually where the
care percentage in the Cuba record is incorrect. This includes
situations where a third party is involved (refer to Care - Additional
Carers intray) or where parties have reconciled (refer to Care - Case
Review Required intray). For other updates, either warm transfer the
customer to Centrelink or notify Centrelink of the update required.

Table 8: this table describes the process for updating an 'accepted'
Centrelink care record. The Care Details of an accepted Centrelink care
records can be updated based on new Centrelink information, except for

|                                   |     child, update the Centrelink  |
|                                   |     record. For example: a payee  |
|                                   |     has 60% care of the child and |
|                                   |     Grandma has 40%. The          |
|                                   |     Centrelink care record        |
|                                   |     received shows the payee with |
|                                   |     60% care. Cuba incorrectly    |
|                                   |     defaults the remaining 40%    |
|                                   |     care to the payer and not     |
|                                   |     Grandma. In this instance,    |
|                                   |     update the care to show 60%   |
|                                   |     care to payee and 0% care to  |
|                                   |     payer, or                     |
|                                   | -   parties have reconciled,      |
|                                   |     Centrelink will transfer care |
|                                   |     as 100% to one party and 0%   |
|                                   |     to the other party. In this   |
|                                   |     instance, update Cuba to      |
|                                   |     reflect that either a) both   |
|                                   |     parties have 100% care of the |
|                                   |     child, if either party has    |

Check Centrelink Care Indicators

When care information is transferred via the data exchange, Cuba looks
at the type of information being exchanged in order of the hierarchy and
creates an intray based on the first indicator identified. Once an
indicator is identified, Cuba stops processing for that care record and
creates the Centrelink intray type based on the first indicator that was
identified.

The type of Centrelink intray that generates is based on the following
intray hierarchy.

1.  Care - Data Mismatch
2.  Care - New Child
3.  Care - Potential Reconciliation
4.  Care - Review of Decision Rcvd
5.  Care - Additional Carers
6.  Care - Interim Determination
7.  Care - Case Review Required

Example: A care record is received with both an Additional Carer
indicator and Objection Review indicator set to Finalised. As the Care -
Review of Decision rcvd intray has a higher ranking in the hierarchy
this intray will be created - the Care - Additional Carers intray will
not generate.

Where multiple children of the customer each have care records sent,
only one Centrelink intray will create for the customer regardless of
how many indicators are attached to each child's record.

If Cuba cannot determine which intray to create or what action needs to
be taken, the Centrelink Care - Case Review Required intray will create
as a fall-back measure.

It is important not to finalise the intray until all indicators have
been identified and actioned appropriately. Where a Centrelink intray
has been deleted prior to all relevant indicators being actioned, a
Centrelink intray will continue to recreate on the customer until all
indicators have been addressed.

Note: where Child Support has made a decision not to add a new child as
a relevant dependent child (for example as the new child record has been
received on the step parent) to an assessment a Centrelink intray may
continue to generate on the customer. Currently there is no way to
exclude this information in the data exchange.

Steps to check Centrelink Care Indicators

Table 9: this table describes how to finalise a Centrelink care record
to prevent Centrelink care intrays from recreating unnecessarily where
possible.
