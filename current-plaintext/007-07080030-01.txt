This document outlines how reportable superannuation contributions is
included as part of a customer's adjusted taxable income (ATI) for
Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Child Care Subsidy (CCS), Stillborn Baby
Payment (SBP), Parental Leave Pay (PPL) and Dad and Partner Pay (DAP).

Reportable superannuation contributions

Before 2009-10, reportable superannuation contributions were not
included in a customer's ATI.

Reportable superannuation contributions include:

-   Discretionary contributions made by an employer or personally by the
    customer or partner, for example, voluntary salary sacrificed
    contributions made by the customer/partner or on their behalf by the
    employer. These are above those required by law such as an
    industrial award or the superannuation guarantee. The Australian
    Taxation Office (ATO) website has a superannuation guarantee
    percentage table. See the Resources page for a link, and
-   Any contributions which will be claimed as a tax deduction for
    self-employed customers

Reportable superannuation contributions do not include compulsory
employer contributions.

The amount of the reportable superannuation contributions is recorded
separately and is added to a customer's taxable income to work out their
ATI.

Customers need to include the reportable superannuation contributions in
their income estimate.

ATO link for FTB and CCS

For customers required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant
financial year, the reportable superannuation contributions amount is
included in actual income details transferred electronically from the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for FTB/CCS reconciliation and lump sum
claims.

The Resources page contains a link to the Australian Taxation Office
(ATO) website.
