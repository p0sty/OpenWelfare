Assessing satisfactory study progress for Austudy

The satisfactory progress rules in this procedure are for Austudy only
and are significantly different from those for Youth Allowance (YA).

Table 1: this table describes the steps to determine the satisfactory
progress rules for an Austudy tertiary student.

|                                   | Satisfactory progress is measured |
|                                   | against the student's current     |
|                                   | course of study. This can be      |
|                                   | impacted by previous study at the |
