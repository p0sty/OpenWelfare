| 1                                 | Assessing IOP earnings for a      |

|                                   | period is for 11 days and the     |
|                                   | customer has earned $220.00 for   |
|                                   | work done on some or all of those |
|                                   | 11 days during this period we     |
|                                   | assess the income for the shorter |
|                                   | entitlement period as follows:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $220.00/11 (days in the period) = |
|                                   | $20 per day                       |

|                                   | If the $220 is incorrectly        |
|                                   | divided by 14 days an incorrect   |
|                                   | daily amount will be reached as   |

|                                   | $220.00/14 = $15.71 per day       |

|                                   | When recording IOP income for a   |
|                                   | short entitlement period, ensure  |
|                                   | the correct daily amount is       |
|                                   | assessed by checking the PFAR or  |
|                                   | NIS screen. If not, multiply the  |
|                                   | daily amount by 14 and record     |
|                                   | this amount as the IOP earnings   |
|                                   | and then re-check to ensure the   |
|                                   | correct daily amount is assessed  |
|                                   | as follows:                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $220/11 (days in the period x 14  |
|                                   | = $280                            |
|                                   | $280/14 = $20 per day             |
