| 1                                 | Assessing IOP earnings for a      |
|                                   | short entitlement period prior to |
|                                   | 7 December 2020 changes           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the customer's entitlement     |
|                                   | period is for 11 days and the     |
|                                   | customer has earned $220.00 for   |
|                                   | work done on some or all of those |
|                                   | 11 days during this period we     |
|                                   | assess the income for the shorter |
|                                   | entitlement period as follows:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $220.00/11 (days in the period) = |
|                                   | $20 per day                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the $220 is incorrectly        |
|                                   | divided by 14 days an incorrect   |
|                                   | daily amount will be reached as   |
|                                   | follows:                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $220.00/14 = $15.71 per day       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When recording IOP income for a   |
|                                   | short entitlement period, ensure  |
|                                   | the correct daily amount is       |
|                                   | assessed by checking the PFAR or  |
|                                   | NIS screen. If not, multiply the  |
|                                   | daily amount by 14 and record     |
|                                   | this amount as the IOP earnings   |
|                                   | and then re-check to ensure the   |
|                                   | correct daily amount is assessed  |
|                                   | as follows:                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | $220/11 (days in the period x 14  |
|                                   | = $280                            |
|                                   | $280/14 = $20 per day             |

| 2                                 | Continuous income with annual     |
|                                   | frequency (ANN)                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The system takes employment       |
|                                   | income recorded with a frequency  |
|                                   | of ANN to be the amount earned    |
|                                   | every 364 days. For example, a    |
|                                   | wage of $36,400 ANN will be       |
|                                   | assessed as $1,400 per fortnight. |
|                                   | Over 365 days, the system         |
|                                   | actually assesses $36,500 and in  |
|                                   | a leap year $36,600. However,     |
|                                   | this may be correct as it depends |
|                                   | on how the employer converts the  |
|                                   | annual rate into fortnightly pay, |
|                                   | for example, Australian Public    |
|                                   | Service (APS) fortnightly pay is  |
|                                   | annual salary x 12/313.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where possible, customers who     |
|                                   | advise an annual rate must be     |
|                                   | advised how Services Australia    |
|                                   | assess this. For customers who    |
|                                   | confirm they receive exactly      |
|                                   | their annual salary every year    |
|                                   | regardless of leap years etc.     |
|                                   | (usually principals of trusts or  |
|                                   | companies who arrange this via an |
|                                   | accounting process), record this  |
|                                   | amount x 364/365. However, for    |
|                                   | all the employees whose gross     |
|                                   | fortnightly pay is determined by  |
|                                   | their employment agreement,       |
|                                   | customers must be advised they    |
|                                   | may be disadvantaged if they do   |
|                                   | not advise this amount instead.   |
