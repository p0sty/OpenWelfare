Centrelink/Child Support information exchange

Centrelink Customer Liaison Unit (CLU) response times

This information is in relation to the actioning of Centrelink/Child
Support information exchange macros sent by Child Support staff.

Standard response times are:

-   unreasonable for a parent to provide care for a child - 6 weeks
-   all other requests – 5 business days

Response reminders

-   Responses are scanned onto Cuba and are available through the View
    Correspondence window (this can take 5 days)
-   If a request for information has been sent prior to the date that
    CLU is currently responding to, and a response is not showing on
    Cuba by the due date, forward the original request to CLU-CS Liaison
-   Do not re-send any requests which are still within CLU's response
    timeframes as this creates longer delays and unnecessary work for
    Centrelink Liaison Officers
-   If the response received does not provide the information requested
    or further clarification is required, email the response to CLU-CS
    Liaison with the subject heading 'Clarification of response
    required'

Business impact of delays in data exchange

The business impact of any delay is dependent upon the type of file
involved and for some files, the time in the month the delay occurs.

2016 Governance Arrangement

Purpose of this Governance Arrangement

The purpose of this Governance Arrangement is to set expectations and
establish processes to ensure that legal requirements are observed when
sharing information between master programs.

Master programs

For the purpose of the 2016 Governance Arrangement, the 2 master
programs referred to in this document are Child Support and Centrelink.

This Governance Arrangement:

-   states the purpose for, and the legislation that supports, the
    exchange of mutual customer data between the 2 master programs
    within Services Australia and
-   provides an overview of how data can be exchanged and the process
    for problem resolution where data failure occurs

Acronyms and definitions

-   'AoC' - the Alignment of Care measure, implemented on 1 July 2010
-   'Centrelink' - a master program of Services Australia responsible
    for delivering Commonwealth payments and services
-   'Child Support' - a master program of the agency, responsible for
    facilitating the payment of child support
-   'Mutual customer' - a customer registered with both Centrelink and
    Child Support. A customer does not have to have an 'active case' or
    'current record' in either Centrelink or Child Support for the
    purposes of mutuality

Term of this Governance Arrangement

This Governance Arrangement is current from the date it is published. It
will be reviewed every 12 months and updated when required.

Background

Centrelink and Child Support share mutual customer information to enable
correct assessment of family assistance and social security payments and
assessment and collection of child support payments.

In June 2008, system changes were made to allow for some information to
be automatically shared via a data exchange.

From 1 July 2010, Alignment of Care (AoC) was introduced to allow 1 care
determination to be used to determine both a child support liability and
family assistance entitlement in line with care arrangements of a child.

The child support and family assistance legislation allows for the
sharing of information where the information is required for the
administration of family assistance, social security and child support.

Legislation Enabling Data Exchange

Authority for Disclosure of Information

Information can be exchanged between Centrelink and Child Support only
where it is in accordance with the following provisions of the Privacy
Act 1988, social security law, family assistance law, other relevant
legislation and is necessary to allow Child Support or Centrelink to
fulfil their legislative requirements.

Legislation

Specifically, any exchange of information between Centrelink and Child
Support is governed by the following legislation:

Section 201(1) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999

Section 161(1) of A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration)
Act 1999

Section 16(3)(ba) of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act
1988

Section 72AA of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988

Section 72AB of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988

Section 72AD of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988

Section 150(3)(ba) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

Subsection 351(3) of the Student Assistance Act 1973

Subsection 126(1) of the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 and

Australian Privacy Principles as set out in Schedule 1 of the Privacy
Act 1988.

Privacy and Confidentiality - Protection of Personal Information

Child Support and Centrelink:

-   acknowledge all information exchanged is confidential and will not
    be disclosed to third parties, unless this is authorised by
    legislation or required by a court order; and
-   will ensure that data received from the other party will be kept
    secure and that it is protected by such security safeguards as is
    reasonable to prevent loss, unauthorised access, use, modification,
    disclosure or other misuse

Data Exchange and the sharing of information

Data is transferred electronically between Centrelink and Child Support
for customers matched via the mutual customer matching process. Relevant
information is also shared manually to support the correct
administration of social security and family assistance payments and
child support assessment and collection.

Examples of information shared via the exchange may include:

If the care percentage of a child of a mutual customer is updated in
either the Centrelink or Child Support system, the details will be
automatically transferred to the other master program via the data
exchange. This ensures that the assessment for the child is correct and
aligned between the 2 master programs.

Examples of information being shared manually may include:

Child Support may request details recorded on the Centrelink system for
mutual customers to initiate collection action including but not
restricted to employer and bank account details. This information is not
transferred electronically via the data exchange but can be manually
sourced.

Centrelink may request confirmation from Child Support that a customer
has made an application for child support in order to update the
customer’s Maintenance Action Test status. Where this information is not
transferred electronically via the data exchange it can be manually
sourced.

Data exchange -Data Files

Data is transferred from Child Support to Centrelink, and vice versa,
electronically via various data files. These files are sent daily,
weekly, monthly and annually depending on the information contained in
the file. See Background for detail.

Data exchange escalation

Both master programs agree to work co-operatively to resolve issues with
the data exchange and to provide relevant, timely and appropriate
feedback regarding these issues.

Staff should escalate issues following the below processes:

1.  Where a problem is identified, staff must escalate via their normal
    escalation processes.
2.  The master program responsible will assess the impact of the
    problem, assign a priority for resolution, and take all reasonable
    steps for resolution.
