Note: while a financial institution may be using the NPP, a customer's
individual account still may not be able to receive NPP payments.

Issue Future Payment (IFP) screen codes

Note: staff need to assess the language used by the customer and
determine the correct code to use. For example, the customer may say
they have a crisis. However, the correct code would be an urgent payment
using the code extraordinary circumstances (ECI). Incorrect use of a
code may affect ongoing customer entitlement to immediate payments.
