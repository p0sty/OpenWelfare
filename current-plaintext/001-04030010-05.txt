P24845 problem and workaround

The P24845 system issue may impact in the following scenarios:

-   Where a step parent is claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) that has
    been transferred to them from a biological parent, and the other
    biological parent also becomes entitled to receive FTB, for example,
    their percentage of care increases to above 35%, and they make a
    claim
-   Where the biological parent transfers their FTB to a step parent and
    they later separate. Care details for the child will not be
    transferred correctly to Child Support if a past period care refresh
    is requested
-   The care may transfer to the step parent's child support record
    (with incorrect child relationship details) causing inaccurate child
    support assessments and impacting multiple parties

As a result, where FTB is transferred out to partner ('TOP' is coded on
the Child Override/Claim (CHOC) screen - from parent to step parent) and
the customer is a Centrelink and Child Support mutual customer, these
records are to be referred for investigation. See the Process page of
Notification and assessment of shared care arrangements for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) for more information.

|                                   | have any children together,       |
|                                   | however Derek has a 3 year old    |
|                                   | child, Ruth, from a previous      |
|                                   | relationship. Ruth lives with     |
|                                   | Alison and Derek, and Alison      |
|                                   | stays home to care for the child  |
|                                   | while Derek works full-time. As   |
|                                   | Alison lives with Ruth and Derek, |
|                                   | and is responsible for the daily  |

|                                   | Ben is 4 years old and lives with |
|                                   | grandmother, Polly. Ben's mother, |
|                                   | Liz, is legally responsible for   |
|                                   | Ben, lives with a boyfriend and   |
|                                   | sees Ben intermittently, however  |
|                                   | all decisions affecting Ben's     |
|                                   | daily care and control are left   |
|                                   | to Polly. As a result of this     |
|                                   | circumstance, the determination   |
|                                   | is made that Ben is not in Liz's  |
|                                   | care. As Ben lives with Polly and |
|                                   | Polly very substantially cares    |
|                                   | for Ben, by providing daily care, |
|                                   | and seeing to Ben's welfare,      |
|                                   | Polly is the principal carer and  |

|                                   | Sharon and grandmother, Mavis.    |
|                                   | Mavis contributes towards         |
|                                   | expenses for James and seems to   |
|                                   | shoulder a substantial degree of  |
|                                   | the work associated with James'   |
|                                   | daily care needs. However, as the |
|                                   | natural parent, and with no court |
|                                   | order conferring parental         |
|                                   | responsibility to Mavis, Sharon   |
|                                   | is legally responsible for James  |
|                                   | and can demonstrate she exercises |
|                                   | decisions relating to the daily   |
|                                   | care and control of James. Sharon |
|                                   | is therefore, the principal carer |
|                                   | of James rather than Mavis and is |
|                                   | eligible for PPS.                 |
