This document explains the process and requirements for undertaking
appointments for the ParentsNext program.

ParentsNext overview

ParentsNext is a pre-employment program for Parenting Payment (PP)
(single and partnered) customers with children under 6 years of age,
which may include grandparents or foster parents receiving PP. The
program focuses on offering individual support and referrals to services
that can help customers to plan and prepare for work or connect to the
workforce when their youngest child turns 6.

ParentsNext participants do not need to look for or take up work. The
aim is to encourage customers to think about their future work and study
related goals and to support them in achieving these goals by connecting
them with appropriate services in their local community. The program
offers individualised support that can include help to access secure
housing, financial advice, parenting courses, childcare, transport,
further study, training or volunteering.

ParentsNext history

The program commenced in 2016 across 10 Local Government Areas (LGAs)
and in July 2018, it was rolled out nationally. Participation in the
program was compulsory for parenting payment customers with a child
under 6 who met certain eligibility criteria. In 2021, the program
underwent further changes to the compulsory eligibility criteria to
better target those most in need.

On 5 May 2023, the Government announced

-   The removal of compulsory participation requirements for all
    ParentsNext participants and
-   ParentsNext customers are no longer required to report their income
    fortnightly unless they or their partner are declaring income

ParentsNext will be replaced with a new voluntary pre employment service
after July 2024.

ParentsNext Interim Arrangements from 1 October 2023

Customers will continue to be selected for ParentsNext using the
compulsory eligibility criteria. Customers who are selected will display
as compulsory in the system however they do not have compulsory
participation requirements.

At the Services Australia ParentsNext appointment, Service Officers are
to discuss the benefits of the ParentsNext program with the customer and
book them an appointment with a ParentsNext provider. The customer can
choose to opt out of the program after their appointment with a
provider.

Prior to referring customers to a ParentsNext provider, Service Officers
will need to code a CCE (Caring for a Child not eligible for Carer
Payment) exemption on the customers record until 30 June 2024 or until
the youngest child turns 6, whichever is earlier. This will enable
customers who display as compulsory to voluntarily participate in the
program.

ParentsNext exemptions

ParentsNext exemptions can be recorded by either the agency or the
ParentsNext provider. This will exempt the customer from having
compulsory participation requirements for the duration of the exemption.

Interim Arrangements to facilitate voluntary participation

As ParentsNext is now a voluntary service, all customers who have
participation status of compulsory and who are referred to a ParentsNext
provider must have a CCE exemption applied to their record until:

-   30 June 2024 or
-   until their youngest child turns 6, whichever is the earlier

The use of the CCE exemption has been endorsed by The Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) as this will enable voluntary
participation until the program is abolished.

In limited circumstances, the CCE exemption can be used on a
discretionary basis if the customer does not consent to an appointment
with a ParentsNext provider.

The CCE exemption is also used for customers who do not attend 3
Services Australia ParentsNext appointments.

The granting of an exemption does not change a customer's ParentsNext
eligibility status or their reason for selection. This means a customer
will not exit from the program.

Applying exemptions due to customer circumstances

If a customer qualifies for an exemption based on their circumstances,
i.e. family domestic violence, temporary medical incapacity,) Service
Officers should apply the relevant exemption to match their
circumstances.

Service Officers will have visibility of exemptions that a ParentsNext
provider can record for a participant but they cannot make updates to
the customer's record.

After applying these exemptions, Service Officers can at their
discretion discuss the benefits of the program and book an appointment
with a ParentsNext provider.

See ParentsNext exemptions and exits.

For further information, see ParentsNext eligibility and servicing.

ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia

Parenting Payment customers who are assessed as eligible for ParentsNext
are automatically booked a 10 minute appointment where profiles are
available. If the system is unable to automatically book the
appointment, a Manual Follow-up (MFU) activity will be created to alert
a Service Officer that a ParentsNext appointment needs to be manually
booked.

If the customer has a phone contact number recorded, the appointment
will be undertaken by phone. If there is no contact phone number on the
customer's record, the appointment is undertaken at the customer's local
service centre.

Desktop messaging

To improve attendance at Services Australia ParentsNext phone
appointments, Service Officers can use Desktop Messaging to issue a
pre-call SMS notification (to customers signed up to Electronic
Messaging via SMS). The message will remind the customer:

-   of their ParentsNext phone appointment
-   the call will come from a blocked number, and
-   to answer this call

Note: messages will only be released between 9am and 5pm. Messages sent
before 9am will only issue to the customer after 9am the same day.
Messages sent after 5pm will only issue after 9am the following day.

ParentsNext appointment notifications

All customers selected for ParentsNext will be invited to attend an
appointment with Services Australia. If the customer has subscribed to
receive Centrelink letters online, they will also receive a link via
their online account to a Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations brochure that explains the ParentsNext program.

The letter advises customers that attendance in the program is
voluntary.

The Resources page has a link to the brochure.

Rescheduling ParentsNext appointments with Services Australia

[] If customers contact asking to re-schedule their appointment, tell
them they can reschedule any appointment type via their online account.
Appointments can only be rescheduled up to the scheduled date and time
of the original appointment. After that, a new appointment must be
booked.

See the full list of appointments and parameters for rescheduling and
ParentsNext eligibility and servicing.

Impact of retrospective updates on eligibility

Prior to the recent changes to ParentsNext, if customers provided
evidence of current study, Year 12 or higher or leave with a job to
return to, they were automatically exited from ParentsNext once this
information was coded.

Under interim arrangements, this eligibility criteria no longer applies.
A customer should still be referred to a ParentsNext provider if they:

-   were selected as Early School Leaver or 2 Years on ISP and completed
    Year 12 or higher
-   are currently studying or
-   are on leave with a job to return to

The provider will assess their circumstances and the customer can opt
out of the program after a discussion with the provider.

In limited circumstances, if a customer does not consent to the
appointment and they would have previously met the criteria to exit the
program, code a CCE exemption. See ParentsNext exemptions and exits.

ParentsNext providers

ParentsNext providers will:

-   conduct an initial appointment with the customer to develop and
    create a Participation Plan
-   arrange activities that are chosen by the customer that fit in with
    their family life to help prepare for work and study
-   conduct appointments with the customer at least every 3 months
-   refer the customer to other service providers
-   assess customers' eligibility for an exemption from participation

If an interpreter is needed for the provider appointment this should be
detailed in the notes field and the appointment must be booked no
earlier than 7 days in the future.

If referral options are limited, continue to refer customers to an
available provider if they raise concerns about:

-   their provider's location
-   attending an appointment in person

Tell them their provider can discuss alternate servicing arrangements.

ParentsNext Participation Plans

As ParentsNext participants are provider managed, ParentsNext
Participation Plans are developed and updated by ParentsNext providers
only. Service Officers are only able to view ParentsNext Participation
Plans. They cannot negotiate or update them. If a customer wishes to
update their Participation Plan, refer them to their ParentsNext
provider.

Activities for ParentsNext participants depend on their individual goals
and circumstances. The activities are intended to support customers to
prepare for work in the future or increase their capacity for work.
Activities may include:

-   locally available parenting services
-   referrals to non-vocational support services such as health care or
    counselling services
-   work or study
-   referral to employment services, for example, Workforce Australia

Customers will be given tailored support to develop and sign a
Participation Plan with their provider.

Service Officers must not guarantee or create any expectation, of what a
customer's activities/help may be.

The Resources page has a document outlining appropriate activities that
may be included in a ParentsNext Participation Plan.

Disability Employment Services (DES)

Customers will not be selected for ParentsNext while they are
voluntarily participating in DES. If a customer has been referred to a
DES provider but not yet started, they will still be selected for
ParentsNext if the eligibility criteria is met.

A ParentsNext participant will only be automatically exited where
recorded as commenced.

Information on the status of a DES referral is detailed on the
Participation Summary screen in Process Direct.

The Resources page has details about ParentsNext Participation Plan
activities and links to external websites, Department of Employment and
Workplace Relations and Find a Provider.
