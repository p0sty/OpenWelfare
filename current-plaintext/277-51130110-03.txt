|                                   | however because the step parent   |
|                                   | is claiming FTB, the data         |
|                                   | exchange will not transfer the    |

|                                   | This is because the biological    |
|                                   | parent is not recognised as a     |
|                                   | mutual customer, that is, they    |
|                                   | are not in receipt of FTB. Where  |
|                                   | a customer contacts Centrelink to |

|                                   | Support, Centrelink must confirm  |
