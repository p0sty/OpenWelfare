Treatment specifics

Transition from JIA/sJIA to RA

A patient may receive:

treatment through initial 2 restriction using grandfather baseline
scores (change or recommencement of treatment after a break in
biological medicine of less than 24 months) when:

-   they have received PBS-subsided treatment for paediatric severe
    active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or systemic juvenile
    idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), and
-   the condition has been reclassified to rheumatoid arthritis as an
    adult

Treatment failures

-   A patient cannot trial and fail (or cease to respond) to the same
    PBS-subsidised biological medicine
-   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to a
    PBS-subsidised biologic medicine for this condition 5 times in a
    lifetime, they will no longer be eligible to receive further
    PBS-subsidised treatment for this condition
