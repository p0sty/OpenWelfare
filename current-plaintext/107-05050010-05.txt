|                                   | Amanda determines the instalment  |
|                                   | rate needs to be the greater of   |
|                                   | 10% of gross income or acceptable |
|                                   | cash levels. This is $30 or $60   |

|                                   | As Kylie's debt is, more than     |
|                                   | $750 but less than $1,500 the     |

|                                   | is $60 per fortnight. ($30 per    |
|                                   | week).                            |

|                                   | As Kylie earns $500 gross per     |
|                                   | week, 10% of Kylie's gross income |
|                                   | would equate to $50 per week.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Amanda sets the garnishee at 10%  |
|                                   | of gross income, as this is       |
|                                   | greater than minimum acceptable   |
|                                   | cash levels ($30 week).           |

|                                   | determines that the instalment    |
|                                   | rate is 10% of gross income. The  |
|                                   | garnishee is therefore coded at   |
|                                   | 10% of gross weekly income.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: for FTB debts over $1,500,  |
|                                   | the acceptable cash rate is not   |
|                                   | used to determine instalment      |
|                                   | rates. These debts are recovered  |
|                                   | within 12 months. Customers would |
