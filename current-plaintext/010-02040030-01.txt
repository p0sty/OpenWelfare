This document outlines how to assess and record a student or Australian
Apprentice's independence for ABSTUDY on the grounds of having
participated in the workforce.

Independence criteria

Students or Australian Apprentices applying for ABSTUDY are considered
independent if they have participated in the workforce for at least 3 of
the last 4 years (156 of the last 208 weeks).

This category of independence is permanent. Once granted, the student or
Australian Apprentice remains eligible for independent status for this
claim and any future claims for ABSTUDY.

Students and Australian Apprentices may also meet independence through:

-   self-supporting through full-time paid employment, or
-   full-time or concessional study load students from regional and
    remote areas under self-supporting through employment
-   self-supporting through approved agricultural work (for full-time
    students only)

COVID-19 concession period

The COVID-19 concession period could apply between 25 March to 24
September 2020 (inclusive) to customers claiming independence under
workforce criteria between 1 January 2021 and 24 September 2022.

The Resources page contains a summary of what to include when assessing
workplace participation.
