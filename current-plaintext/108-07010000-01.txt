This document explains the assessment of employment income for
Centrelink payments.

Definition of employment income

Employment income is income for which a customer has actually done some
work.

This includes:

-   wages
-   cash payments
-   supported wages
-   salaries
-   stipends
-   commission
-   honoraria
-   bonuses
-   penalty rates or overtime
-   salary amounts voluntarily sacrificed to superannuation, and
-   leave payments received in relation to an employee/employer
    relationship where the customer is still engaged on an ongoing basis

Income paid for work performed is employment income.

To calculate income, the gross rate of employment income is used, before
taxation or any personal deductions, including voluntarily salary
sacrificed contributions to superannuation.

If a customer receives a gift in kind, in lieu of money for work
performed, the value of the gift is assessed as income by way of
valuable consideration. However, credits received from participation in
approved exchange trading systems (ETS) and other community exchange
schemes are not treated as income for social security purposes, unless
both cash and credits in ETS schemes are received, in which case the
cash amount is assessed as income.

See Recording and correcting employment income details for assistance
recording details of employment income.

Leave or redundancies

For information on the assessment of leave or redundancies, see Leave
and termination payments paid by an employer.

Seasonal work

For information on the assessment of income from seasonal work, see
Assessing income from seasonal work.

Working Credit and Work Bonus

Working Credit allows certain income support recipients of workforce age
to offset income from employment against credits accrued during periods
of low or no income. Employment income only affects the customer's
payment when the Working Credit has been depleted and the income free
area exceeded. If the customer's income reduces their fortnightly rate
to nil and some of that income is employment income, the customer's
payment may remain current at nil rate for up to six fortnights and they
may retain certain benefits.

The Work Bonus is a discount applicable to the assessment of employment
income paid to Age Pension age pensioners, except Parenting Payment
Single (PPS) customers who are Age Pension age.

Partnered customers receiving family assistance and pension or benefit

For partnered customers receiving family assistance and social security
pension or benefit but not receiving an allowance it may be appropriate
to update the family estimate when employment income is updated under
the following conditions:

-   neither the customer nor partner has updated the family estimate on
    that day or within this contact
-   the customer or partner is making a personal contact (that is,
    source is personal or phone)
-   if the partner contacts to provide new income details for income
    support purposes, and could reasonably be expected to provide an
    estimate, the estimate can be updated
