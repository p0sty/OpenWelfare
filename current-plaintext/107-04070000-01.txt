Customer debts

-   duplicate payment
-   payment made after death
-   not eligible for payment
-   incorrect bank account (third party - individual)
-   false/multiple identity
-   internal fraud
-   false statement/misrepresentation

Employer debts

Raise Organisation debts for PPL for the following reasons:

-   claimant not entitled to payment
-   payment not forwarded
-   notification failure - employer
-   duplicate payment
-   incorrect bank account (third party - organisation)
-   false/multiple identity
-   internal fraud

If the employer:

-   has not yet paid the money to the employee, the debt is recovered
    from the employer

    employee

Where the employer pays the PPL to the wrong person, they need to
recover this amount.
