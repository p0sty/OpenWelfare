|                                   | been fully completed, but the top |
|                                   | section of the back page is       |
|                                   | incomplete.                       |

|                                   | As the newborn child’s name has   |
|                                   | been provided in the Add Newborn  |
|                                   | service, the back page still      |
|                                   | serves as acceptable proof of     |
|                                   | birth for Centrelink purposes.    |
