This document outlines the questions a customer must answer on the
Module iA Income and Assets (Mod iA). It explains why the module is
issued and what information it collects.

Purpose of the Mod iA

The Mod iA is used to obtain information about a customer's (and/or
their partner's) income and assets.

The Mod iA allows customers to provide multiple updates to their income
and assets details, or when they are unable to provide all of the
details about their income and asset changes in an online transaction, a
call centre, or a service centre interaction.

Points to note

Points to note in completing the module:

-   all questions on the form that need to be answered
-   if income and/or assets have changed the form asks for supporting
    documentation (for example, payslips, bank statements) however,
    where the customer and/or their partner are currently in receipt of
    income support payments, verification is only required when doubt
    exists (see Verifying income and assets for further information)
-   partner permission to enquire must be reconfirmed or it will lapse
-   the module must be signed by the customer
-   a spouse not receiving or claiming an income support payment is not
    required to sign the module
-   the partner may choose to complete a Mod IA separately
-   if both members of a couple are receiving or claiming an income
    support payment, the signature of both is required on all income and
    asset forms
