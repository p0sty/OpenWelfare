Income for PPL claims for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023 - Individual and Family Income

The following scenarios provide guidance for when PPL claimants are to
be assessed under the individual income limit or the family income
limit, and when evidence is required to verify income.

Income limits are indexed annually on 1 July. Evidence is required if
the customer and/or partner’s ATI is 90% or more of the relevant
financial year income limit. The following scenarios are based on the
2022/2023 income limit amounts:
