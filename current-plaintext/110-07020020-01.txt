This document outlines the procedure to conduct reviews of independence
for ABSTUDY.

Independent status

ABSTUDY students and Australian Apprentices who are granted independent
status may be granted either permanent or reviewable independent status.
Reviewable independent status means the grounds for which independent
status was granted may change and therefore affect eligibility for
independent status.

Review reasons for independent status

The reviewable ABSTUDY independent status grant reasons include:

-   the customer is above the age of consent in their state or
    territory, and living in a de facto relationship which is of at
    least six months’ duration
-   the customer currently has the care or custody of another person's
    dependent child/student
-   the customer is 15 years of age or over and has parent(s) who cannot
    exercise their parental responsibilities
-   the customer is 16 years of age or over and living in an Indigenous
    Australian community after previously being adopted or fostered by a
    non-Indigenous family for more than two years, or
-   the customer is of minimum school leaving age or at least 16 years
    of age, and homeless (including customers in state care who are not
    living with a carer or receiving any ongoing support from the state
    or territory

Change in circumstances

A review of independent ABSTUDY status may occur due to a change in the
customer's circumstances. ABSTUDY customers granted under a reviewable
independence category do not have to reapply for independent status each
year, but may need to re-establish eligibility when their circumstances
change. They must notify Services Australia of a change in circumstances
within 14 days.

The change in circumstance that may affect independence would depend on
the reason for grant of independence. See Process for examples.
