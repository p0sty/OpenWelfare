(delegate) to decide if supporting documents/evidence is acceptable or
further information should be requested.

For assistance with:

Preliminary Notice

A preliminary notice is a legal notice that advises Services Australia
(the agency) may wish to recover an amount from a compensation payer or
insurer. A preliminary notice may be given to a compensation payer or
their indemnifying insurer when the agency is notified that

-   a customer has made a compensation claim against the compensation
    payer, or
-   a customer’s compensation has recently settled but not yet been paid
    to the customer

A preliminary notice prevents the compensation payer or insurer from
making any payment to the customer until the agency has determined if a
recovery is applicable. Payment of the compensation must not be made
until:

-   the preliminary notice has been revoked by the agency; or
-   the amount under the recovery notice has been paid; or
-   the CEO has given the compensation payer or insurer permission to
    pay an amount

A compensation payer or insurer commits an offence if they do not comply
with the preliminary notice.
