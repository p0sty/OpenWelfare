Payability of late payment charges

A late payment charge of $100 per debt and interest of 20 per cent per
annum were payable when the customer:

-   had not paid in full within three months of the original debt notice
-   failed to enter into a satisfactory payment arrangement within three
    months of the original notice, or
-   defaulted on a repayment arrangement for more than seven days
    without a satisfactory explanation

Late payment charges and interest were not payable when:

-   the debt balance was under $200
-   defaults on repayments were not the customer's fault and they had
    taken reasonable steps to repay
-   it was not cost effective to pursue recovery of the late payment
    charge and/or interest, or
-   the late payment charge and interest would cause the customer undue
    financial hardship

Cessation of interest accrual

Interest automatically ceased accruing when:

-   a repayment arrangement was made
-   a garnishee was applied, or
-   the debt was written off/waived
