This document outlines details of the Disbursement interview process
when a customer exits Voluntary Income Management.

Disbursement Interview

Customers can request a Disbursement interview to discuss how they will
manage ongoing expenses and how residual funds will be paid out when
Income Management ends.

If a customer does not attend a Disbursement interview or make contact
with the agency when Income Management ends, the Auto Disbursement rules
are used.

Reasons Voluntary Income Management ends

Voluntary Income Management will end in the following circumstances:

-   the customer is no longer receiving a category H welfare payment
-   the customer no longer meets the legislative requirements for
    Voluntary Income Management
-   the customer has completed the mandatory 13 week period on Income
    Management and requests to terminate their Agreement
-   the customer becomes eligible for a measure higher in the hierarchy
    of Income Management measures
-   the customer moves into a Cashless Debit Card area
-   the customer has an excluded payment nominee for Income Management
    purposes
-   the agency terminates the Voluntary Income Management Agreement if
    certain events occur, or
-   the customer has passed away

Terminating a Voluntary Income Management Agreement

A mandatory period of 13 weeks on Voluntary Income Management must be
completed before a customer can request to exit Income Management. []
Eligible customers can end Voluntary Income Management online via their
Centrelink Online Account.

When a customer exits Voluntary Income Management, a 21 day waiting
period will apply before a new Agreement can be entered into. Only 4
exits per 12 months can be made from Voluntary Income Management.

Discussions at a Disbursement interview

The following will be discussed with customers who request to attend a
Disbursement interview:

-   if appropriate, how any residual income managed funds will be
    disbursed, including confirmation of bank details
-   using Centrepay or the Rent Deduction Scheme to meet ongoing
    expenses
-   eligibility for another measure of Income Management
-   continued use of their BasicsCard for up to 60 days after Income
    Management ends
-   the option to appoint a payment nominee, and
-   where to find information to help manage their finances. A customer
    can visit servicesaustralia.gov.au/managingmoney for useful
    information and resources

Preparing for a Disbursement interview

To prepare for a Disbursement interview, a Service Officer should:

-   check whether the customer requires an interpreter. If required,
    refer to Booking an interpreter for an appointment
-   investigate the record to determine whether the customer is eligible
    for a compulsory measure of Income Management, or is likely to
    become eligible in the near future
-   check the customer's available Income Managed funds
-   check whether the customer has an active BasicsCard and the current
    balance
-   check the record for any vulnerability indicators as the customer
    may benefit from a referral to a social worker, and
-   have the relevant communication products on hand (for example,
    Centrepay information, Nominee forms)

The Resources page contains a scenario of a customer requesting an early
exit from their Voluntary Income Management Agreement, and a link to
