Overview of the 3 types of case consult scenarios

Case consultation scenarios appropriate for social work involvement

There are 3 scenarios, which may occur during a case consult:

A case discussion between the PST-skilled social worker and PST-skilled
Service Officer:

A case discussion occurs when the PST-skilled Service Officer has
gathered relevant information and evidence but needs help with assessing
and understanding the impact of the identified personal circumstances on
the customer's capacity to comply.

These consultations may involve seeking evidence from the social worker
to assess capacity or to seek advice regarding referral options.

During these case discussions, the PST-skilled Service Officer and
PST-skilled social worker would be engaged in the conversation and the
social worker would not speak directly with the customer.

A three-way discussion with the PST-skilled social worker, PST-skilled
Service Officer and customer:

At times, the PST-skilled social worker may need to speak with the
customer to clarify circumstances or get more details. In these
instances, the PST-skilled Service Officer will not put their headset
down but will stay on the line, listening to the conversation and
providing information where appropriate. Once the PST-skilled Service
Officer has the information needed, the PST-skilled social worker will
leave the call to allow the compliance investigation to continue.

The PST-skilled social worker may take over the call:

At times, a PST-skilled social worker may take over the call if they
need to have a private conversation with the customer because the:

-   customer presents with a complex crisis
-   customer is potentially at risk, or
-   content may be distressing for the PST-skilled Service Officer

During the consultation, a PST-skilled Service Officer may also request
the PST-skilled social worker to take over the call because they believe
the content is or could be distressing for them to hear. If the
PST-skilled social worker has taken over the call and there is an
outstanding compliance decision, they will follow the warm handback
procedure as outlined on the Process page.
