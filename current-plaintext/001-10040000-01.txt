This document outlines how to conduct a compliance investigation when a
job seeker has not met compulsory requirements.

Job seeker compliance investigations

For job seekers managed under the Targeted Compliance Framework,
compliance investigations may be initiated to determine if:

-   an unemployment failure or work refusal failure has been committed,
    or
-   a financial penalty will be applied where a job seeker in the
    penalty zone commits a mutual obligation failure

For job seekers managed under the Job Seeker Compliance Framework in
Community Development Program (CDP) regions, compliance investigations
may be initiated to determine if:

-   an Unemployment Non-Payment Period (UNPP) will be applied
-   a connection, non-attendance, reconnection, No Show, No Pay or
    serious failure has occurred

Providers who initiate a job seeker compliance investigation may speak
with the job seeker before submitting a compliance investigation.
Compliance investigations focus on determining whether a financial
penalty will be applied to a job seeker.

Staff members who are responsible for these job seeker compliance
decisions are referred to as Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled
staff.

Services Australia may also generate compliance investigations when an
unemployment failure or work refusal failure has been identified,
however Service Officers must have evidence that these non-compliance
events have occurred before generating an investigation.

PST-skilled staff or staff with UNPP security resource are responsible
for investigating:

-   voluntary unemployment at new claim or
-   unemployment due to misconduct at new claim

Focus of a compliance investigation

The reported non-compliance event is the starting point for all
compliance investigations.

When conducting a compliance investigation, Services Australia must:

-   ensure job seekers clearly understand expectations, as well as the
    consequences of not meeting requirements
-   provide opportunity for job seekers to explain their reason for
    non-compliance and any matters they'd like considered as part of the
    investigation and decision making process
-   collect and consider all relevant evidence to establish the facts
-   record and review any job seeker circumstances that are impacting
    the job seeker's compliance and may affect future servicing or
    require discussion with their provider

Note: a PST skilled staff must consult with a PST-skilled social worker
where the job seeker presents with family and domestic violence or has a
current Family relationships/Domestic violence circumstance recorded.
See Accessing a PST-skilled social worker.

All compliance investigations are recorded in the Participation
compliance hub.
