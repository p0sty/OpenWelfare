For Services Australia social workers only

This document outlines information about recording Vulnerable Welfare
Payment Recipient (VWPR) assessments in the Social Work Recording
Application (SWRA) in Process Direct and the Social Work Information
System (SWIS) in Customer First.

The IM program closed to new entrants on 4 September 2023. Customers who
are identified for income management under this measure or move between
measures on the hierarchy and otherwise meet the eligibility criteria to
participate, must commence on enhanced IM.

Customers on IM under the VWPR measure may choose to move to enhanced
IM.

VWPR assessments

The VWPR assessment is generally part of a complex social work
intervention requiring ongoing contacts with customers and third parties
if appropriate.

There is no maximum number of contacts that can be recorded and this
should reflect the complexity of the customer’s circumstances as well as
the social work assistance provided.

Eligibility triggers for VWPR

Young people can be subject to automatic triggers for VWPR if they meet
one of the following eligibility triggers:

-   aged under 16 years and in receipt of Special Benefit (SpB-USY)
-   16 years of age or over and in receipt of an independent rate of
    Youth Allowance, Disability Support Pension or ABSTUDY Living
    Allowance due to meeting the Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH)
    status, or
-   under the age of 25 and receive a Crisis Payment (CrP) within the
    last 13 weeks due to prison release or psychiatric confinement

Customers will not be identified for Income Management or enhanced
Income Management (enhanced IM) if they are:

-   full-time students
-   Australian apprentices
-   currently on Voluntary Income Management (VIM) or Voluntary enhanced
    Income Management (VeIM)

Detrimental Exclusion

Detrimental Exclusion temporarily excludes a young person from having
the VWPR Youth IM or enhanced IM automatic triggers applied because the
social worker has determined that IM or enhanced IM will be detrimental
to the young person's wellbeing.

The VWPR Detrimental Exclusion assessment is generally part of a complex
social work intervention requiring a number of contacts with customers
and third parties if appropriate.

There is no maximum number of contacts that can be recorded, and this
should reflect the complexity of the customer's circumstances as well as
the social work assistance provided.

Not Practicable - Support and Demonstrated Capacity Exclusion

Social workers may determine welfare quarantining is 'Not Practicable
due to Support and Demonstrated Capacity' as the customer has been on
VWPR Youth IM or enhanced IM for 12 months, and they have:

-   successfully engaged in a supportive relationship that provided
    mentoring, coaching or case management that included a transition to
    independence, or
-   demonstrated the skills and ability to manage their money and to
    live independently, and
-   satisfied the social worker that the customer is likely to continue
    participating in appropriate activities/supportive arrangements and
    therefore does not need to remain on welfare quarantining

A Social Work Information System (SWIS) report must be completed for
these exclusion assessments (granted or rejected).

The VWPR exclusion assessment is generally part of a complex social work
intervention requiring a number of contacts with customers and third
parties if appropriate.

There is no maximum number of contacts that can be recorded, and this
should reflect the complexity of the customer's circumstances as well as
the social work assistance provided.

Payment Recipient (VWPR Youth) Income Management and enhanced IM by

Child safe framework

In line with a zero tolerance approach to harm of children, if a staff
member in the course of their duties observes behaviour, which raises
concerns about a child or young person's safety, Services Australia sets
out specific steps that must be taken. Follow the agency's Risk
Identification and Reporting model when identifying and responding to
child safety concerns. See Risk identification and management of threats
to the safety or welfare of a child for more information regarding this
model and the agency's commitment to the safety of children and young
people.
