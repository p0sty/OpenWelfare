This document outlines information for Comprehensive Compliance
Assessment (CCA) Specialists about how to conduct a CCA.

Intention of the CCA

The CCA and the CCA report is intended to inform a serious failure
decision, which:

-   considers the appropriateness of current mutual obligation
    requirements
-   uncovers and records the reasons for non-compliance
-   identifies barriers that have been affecting the Community
    Development Program (CDP) job seeker's capacity to comply with their
    current mutual obligation requirements
-   suggests additional or alternative assistance that may benefit the
    CDP job seeker as required

CCA roles and responsibilities

The CCA Specialist:

suggests or recommends non-vocational interventions to providers

undertakes or facilitates crisis intervention where required

refers the CDP job seeker for follow-up intervention to be conducted

recommends reconsideration of current mutual obligation requirements
where appropriate

-   In doing this, the CCA Specialist is not required to recommend
    specific alternative participation requirements or employment
    servicing strategies

updates the Job Seeker Snapshot where significant changes in
circumstances are identified

reviews previously recorded interventions and where no longer required,
records an outcome

where appropriate, discusses interventions with the CDP job seeker's CDP
Provider

The CDP Provider:

considers and implements interventions to address non-vocational issues
identified via the CCA

can record an outcome against interventions the provider has
responsibility for implementing

when contacted by the CCA Specialist, may provide further information
regarding:

-   the CDP job seeker's history of participation
-   known circumstances impacting the CDP job seeker's ability to
    participate, and
-   success of previous recommendations

The Participation Solutions Team (PST)-skilled Service Officer (WNPPD):

-   Makes a determination on persistent non- compliance following the
    completion of the CCA report
-   Considers and implements recommendations of the CCA report. For
    example, coding exemptions, inviting the job seeker to claim an
    alternative payment, actioning appropriate referrals for a review of
    entitlement to payment
-   Re-engages CDP job seekers with their provider after completion of
    the CCA where re-engagement is required

Key objectives when conducting a CCA

Strengthening the integrity of the Job Seeker Compliance Framework

-   Help to ensure that participation expectations are reinforced and
    provide the serious failure decision maker with a quality assessment
    of the reason/s for non-compliance

Hearing the CDP job seeker's circumstances

-   Provide an opportunity for CDP job seekers to discuss their mutual
    obligation requirements, whether they are having difficulty
    complying with these and if so, reasons why

Uncovering the issues affecting a CDP job seeker's ability to meet their
requirements, including:

-   circumstances impacting their ability to comply (such as suspected
    mental health issues that may not have been previously disclosed or
    fully assessed)
-   the CCA Specialist contacting other third parties, such as job
    seeker's CDP Provider to discuss any identified circumstances

Identifying opportunities for intervention if required to help prevent
future non-compliance

-   Through understanding the CDP job seeker's circumstance, consider
    suitable interventions to address identified barriers

Supporting the provider to take appropriate action if required to target
assistance to the CDP job seeker, recognising that the provider has a
level of flexibility to tailor their service

Extra considerations for a Review CCA

Where a CCA has been finalised, any further CCAs triggered within a 12
month period are referred to as Review CCAs. In conducting a Review CCA,
the CCA Specialist should:

-   explore any changes in the CDP job seeker's circumstances since the
    previous CCA
-   review the progress and outcomes of interventions to address the
    circumstances identified within the previous CCA
-   consider any new interventions that may be appropriate based on any
    new job seeker circumstances identified

CCA report and purpose

During a CCA, the CCA Specialist is responsible for producing a CCA
report which is used by the decision maker responsible for determining
whether a serious failure for persistent non- compliance has occurred.
This can also be used by the CDP job seeker's provider to assist with
negotiating appropriate requirements.

The CCA report includes a summary of:

-   identified circumstances impacting the CDP job seeker's
    non-compliance
-   how these identified circumstances impact the CDP job seeker's
    ability to meet their mutual obligation requirements
-   recommended interventions to improve engagement with requirement,
    including who has responsibility for undertaking interventions, and
-   if provider contact occurred, the outcomes of this contact
