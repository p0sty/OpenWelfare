|                                   | Answer: The $1,000 waiver applied |
|                                   | to debts resulting from the       |
|                                   | 2000-01 reconciliation for:       |

|                                   | Note: a separate $1,000 waiver    |
|                                   | applies to both FTB and CCB.      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The $1,000 waiver applies to the  |
|                                   | above debts resulting from:       |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | -   maintenance income for FTB    |

|                                   |     child income limit            |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | for FTB, and                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | incorrect multiple child rate for |

|                                   | In some cases reconciliation will |
|                                   | not occur. However, the waiver    |
|                                   | may still apply. For example,     |
|                                   | cancellation of a customer's FTB  |
|                                   | due to their only FTB child's     |
|                                   | income was over the limit. In     |
|                                   | these cases, apply the waiver     |
|                                   | manually.                         |
