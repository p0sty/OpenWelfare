|                                   | Example of how to calculate       |
|                                   | income for an employment pay      |
|                                   | period greater than an            |

|                                   | If a customer was paid $220.00    |
|                                   | for a pay period of 14 days       |

|                                   | 11 days the system will need to   |
|                                   | still assess the $220.00 for 14   |
|                                   | days. If the $220.00 is coded     |
|                                   | with an IOP frequency, the system |
|                                   | incorrectly assumes the employer  |
|                                   | pay period is 11 days and         |
|                                   | apportions the rate as $220.00/11 |
|                                   | = $20.00 per day instead of       |
|                                   | calculating the correct daily     |
|                                   | amount of $15.71 over 14 days     |
|                                   | resulting in potential            |
|                                   | overpayment.                      |

|                                   | the system will assess $172.86 in |

When coding employment income under the ‘earned’ and ‘paid’ model,
ensure income is not counted twice. If a customer provides payslips
covering both the earned and paid model, and their income has not been
reported and coded on the system, code:

-   all paid income amounts on the EAPP screen from the transition
    entitlement period, and
-   all earned income amounts on the EAN screen

To reduce any duplication of income, staff will either:

-   deduct any earned income coded on the EAN screen from the paid
    income amount during the transition entitlement period, or
-   only code earned income up to the pay period start date of the paid
    income amount during the transition entitlement period

For more information, see Transition Period Calculation Example.

DOC any calculations. The online calculator can be used to assist with
calculating the correct amount to report during the transition period.

Note: for assistance with correct Date of Event (DOV) coding, see
Determining the Date of Event for Employment Income or Assessing and
Coding Employment Income.

Customers with existing continuous employment income recorded on the
Employment Income Summary (EAN) screen or Foreign Income/Asset Details
(FID) screen before 7 December 2020, automatically had their employment
income changed to the new:

-   Employment Income Paid Details (EAPP) screen, or
-   Foreign Employment Income Paid Details (FEIP) screen

If a customer contacts to change their ‘converted’ continuous income, a
Service Officer needs to code a change.

If the customer has income coded on the EAPP screen due to a conversion
(CNV), the income will display on the EAN screen:

See EAN IMAGE 1 in EAN/EAPP screen coding

-   On the EAPP screen, code the new income amount using the Date of
    Event (DOV) as the date the customer is paid by their employer
-   If the date paid is on or after the EPSD, end the previous income
    conversion coding from an earlier DOV. This is to make sure the
    income is assessed correctly
-   The DOV to zero off conversion coding is the day after the last date
    paid by the employer. That is date last paid by employer + 1

If the customer contacts to change the new continuous income amount:

-   Do not zero off previous income
-   Code the date paid and new amount, then income will assess correctly
-   If the customer ceases employment, zero the income using DOV as the
    date last paid by employer + 1

Example

Customer has continuous income coded of $1,200 per fortnight with the
DOV as the EPSD of transition entitlement period 24 November 2020.

Customer contacts on 18 January 2021 to advise:

-   their income has changed to $1,000, and
-   the date paid by their employer is 12 January 2021

If the Service Officer only codes 12 January 2021 with the amount of
$1,000, the system will assess both income for 12 January 2021 and the
notional pay event of $1,200.

The Service Officer must end the conversion coding.

The customer advises they were last paid $1,200 on 29 December 2020.

The Service Officer must code ‘0’ with a DOV 30 December 2020. That is,
they code on the EAPP screen the date last paid by employer + 1.

See EAPP IMAGE 1 in EAN/EAPP screen coding

Coding a zero, will cease the notional pay event for the 5 January 2021.
The new income correctly displays on the EAN screen.

See EAN IMAGE 2 in EAN/EAPP screen coding
