This document outlines the Quality On Line (QOL) and Quality Management
Application (QMA) dispute process in the Face to Face (F2F) Services
Division, including how staff can lodge a dispute.

The process is based on the Quality Dispute Policy.

Social Security and Welfare (SSW) Quality will manage disputes lodged by
F2F staff in Service Zones.

Timeframes

Disputes must be lodged within 30 days of the Quality Check being
completed, unless a staff member has been on leave. In these cases, the
dispute is lodged within 14 days of their return to work.

Staff responsibility

Staff submitting disputes must:

finalise all actions on customer's record before lodging dispute. They
must:

-   complete all actions on the customer's record as a priority
-   not HOLD or leave a NOT or STA activity on the customer's record,
    pending the outcome of a dispute
-   talk to their team leader if unsure of the correct action to take,
    pending the outcome of the dispute

support their dispute with evidence, that is:

-   the relevant Operational Blueprints (including Table and Step where
    applicable), and/or
-   other nationally endorsed references current when the check was
    completed (for example, NNUs or Roxy)

Independent reviewer

A Service Support Officer (SSO) in Social Security and Welfare Quality
(SSW Quality) who has the relevant technical expertise, will carry out
the independent review.

Note: if the SSO network does not have technical expertise in a certain
area, they will consult with a technical specialist.

The Independent Reviewer will determine if the outcome of the dispute
is:

-   Upheld - agree with original check decision
-   Upheld for different reason - original checking decision is correct
    but for a different reason. For example, different error reason
-   Overturned - original decision overturned. That is, agree with
    dispute
