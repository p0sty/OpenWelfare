This document outlines the process for determining whether an exemption
from compulsory mutual obligation requirements can be granted for job
seekers who have been personally affected by a natural disaster or a
declared emergency.

Mutual obligation requirement exemptions

Job seekers are expected to comply with reasonable mutual obligation
requirements in return for receiving relevant income support payment.

Where a job seeker has been affected by a natural disaster or declared
emergency, consideration should be given to the reasonableness of their
requirements during the period that they are affected.

There are a range of mutual obligation exemptions that may be granted to
job seekers who have been personally affected by a natural disaster or
declared emergency.
