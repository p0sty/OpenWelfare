+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | FAA for journey home on           |
|                                   | completion of studies             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ted, a tertiary student, is       |
|                                   | entitled to ABSTUDY FAA for       |
|                                   | travel between a home address in  |
|                                   | Toowoomba and the University of   |
|                                   | Queensland. Ted makes a claim for |
|                                   | FAA for the journey home on       |
|                                   | completion of studies in          |
|                                   | November. Ted uses private        |
|                                   | transport for this journey.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ted would be paid FAA at the rate |
|                                   | of either economy rail or bus     |
|                                   | fare for the journey.             |

| 2                                 | FAA for journey to permanent home |
|                                   | at completion of studies          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Carly's permanent home is in      |
|                                   | Maryborough and undertakes        |
|                                   | studies in Brisbane. On           |
|                                   | completion of studies, Carly      |
|                                   | travels by rail to Nambour and    |
|                                   | then takes a bus to visit a       |
|                                   | family member in Noosa for a day  |
|                                   | before continuing on the journey  |
|                                   | to Maryborough by rail. Carly     |
|                                   | makes a claim for the travel      |
|                                   | home.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Carly would be entitled to        |
|                                   | ABSTUDY FAA for travel between    |
|                                   | the educational institution and   |
|                                   | home and would be paid FAA at the |
|                                   | rate of economy rail for the      |
|                                   | direct route from Brisbane to     |
|                                   | Maryborough, only.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3                                 | FAA for travel by private vehicle |
|                                   | where there is no public          |
|                                   | transport                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | At the start of studies for the   |
|                                   | year, Bill travels 60 kilometres  |
|                                   | from home by car to the nearest   |
|                                   | railway station to connect with   |
|                                   | the rail service to the           |
|                                   | educational institution. Bill     |
|                                   | makes a claim for this journey to |
|                                   | commence studies.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | It is determined there is no      |
|                                   | public transport service          |
|                                   | available for the journey from    |
|                                   | Bill's home to the railway        |
|                                   | station and that the journey made |
|                                   | is the most direct to the         |
|                                   | institution. Bill would be paid   |
|                                   | FAA at the appropriate rate of    |
|                                   | motor vehicle allowance for the   |
|                                   | journey from home to the railway  |
|                                   | station plus the economy rail     |
|                                   | fare from the station to the      |
|                                   | institution.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4                                 | FAA to attend testing and         |
|                                   | assessment exercise               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Rhiannon's home is at Port        |
|                                   | Hedland. Rhiannon is undertaking  |
|                                   | a testing and assessment exercise |
|                                   | at the University of Western      |
|                                   | Australia in Perth. The testing   |
|                                   | program involves a written test   |
|                                   | and an interview and takes        |
|                                   | approximately 4 hours. The normal |
|                                   | mode of transport for an approved |
|                                   | traveller between Port Hedland    |
|                                   | and Perth is an economy class bus |
|                                   | journey that takes 14 hours. It   |
|                                   | is unreasonable and impractical   |
|                                   | to expect Rhiannon to travel by   |
|                                   | bus for 14 hours each way to      |
|                                   | undertake a testing and           |
|                                   | assessment activity of only 4     |
|                                   | hours. In these circumstances, an |
|                                   | economy air ticket would be       |
|                                   | approved for Rhiannon to          |
|                                   | undertake the journey to          |
|                                   | participate in testing.           |

| 5                                 | FAA to attend scholarship         |
|                                   | interview                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jenny's home address is           |
|                                   | Geraldton. Jenny has been short   |
|                                   | listed for a scholarship at the   |
|                                   | prestigious Presbyterian Ladies   |
|                                   | College in Perth. Jenny is        |
|                                   | required to undertake an          |
|                                   | interview at the school. The      |
|                                   | appropriate mode of transport     |
|                                   | from Geraldton to Perth is an     |
|                                   | economy class bus journey. Due to |
|                                   | the bus schedules, Jenny would    |
|                                   | have to travel on the day prior   |
|                                   | to the interview and then return  |
|                                   | on the day after the interview.   |
|                                   | This would require meals and      |
|                                   | accommodation for 2 nights in     |
|                                   | Perth. Due to Jenny's age, a      |
|                                   | supervisor or family member would |
|                                   | need to also travel to supervise  |
|                                   | Jenny for the 2 nights. It is     |
|                                   | more cost-effective to approve a  |
|                                   | flight for Jenny to travel to and |
|                                   | from the interview on the same    |
|                                   | day. Whilst the flight is more    |
|                                   | expensive than the bus ticket, it |
|                                   | is more cost-effective when       |
|                                   | considering the additional costs  |
|                                   | associated with supervisor or     |
|                                   | family member travel and 2 nights |
|                                   | of meals and accommodation costs. |

|                                   | Olivia is 13 years old and lives  |
|                                   | in Chinchilla. Olivia boards away |
|                                   | from home in Townsville. Olivia   |
|                                   | normally travels to Townsville    |
|                                   | via a bus between Chinchilla and  |
|                                   | Roma, and a commercial flight     |
|                                   | between Roma and Brisbane and     |
|                                   | Brisbane to Townsville. Changes   |
|                                   | have been made to the flight      |
|                                   | schedule which means this route   |
|                                   | now arrives in Townsville at      |
|                                   | 10:30 pm. This is considered an   |
|                                   | unreasonable arrival time for a   |
|                                   | 13 year old child.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There is not a direct bus service |
|                                   | between Chinchilla and Brisbane   |
|                                   | which supports connecting to a    |
|                                   | commercial flight for Townsville. |
|                                   | The alternate mode of transport   |
|                                   | is approval of Motor Vehicle      |
|                                   | Allowance (MVA) for a parent to   |
|                                   | drive Olivia directly between     |
|                                   | Chinchilla and Brisbane to        |
|                                   | connect with a flight to/from     |
|                                   | Townsville. To ensure Olivia does |
|                                   | not undertake travel between      |
|                                   | Chinchilla and Townsville which   |
|                                   | arrives at an unreasonable time,  |
|                                   | MVA is the most practical,        |
|                                   | reasonable and cost-effective     |
|                                   | mode of transport.                |

|                                   | Michael is 15 years old and lives |
|                                   | in Halls Creek. Michael boards    |
|                                   | away from home to study in        |
|                                   | Sydney. Michael’s travel normally |
|                                   | involves a charter flight between |
|                                   | Halls Creek and Darwin and then a |
|                                   | commercial flight between Darwin  |
|                                   | and Sydney. Michael has provided  |
|                                   | a medical certificate from a      |
|                                   | Doctor outlining that Michael     |
|                                   | becomes airsick in small planes   |
|                                   | and has asked for an alternate    |
|                                   | mode of transport instead of the  |
|                                   | charter flight.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | An alternate mode of transport    |
|                                   | can be approved for a bus between |
|                                   | Halls Creek and Kununurra and     |
|                                   | then a commercial flight between  |
|                                   | Kununurra and Darwin. The         |
|                                   | alternate mode of transport is    |
|                                   | cost-effective and reasonable in  |
|                                   | relation to Michael suffering     |
|                                   | airsickness. However, depending   |
|                                   | on flight arrival/departure times |
|                                   | in Kununurra, sometimes the       |
|                                   | connecting bus service            |
|                                   | arrives/departs from Halls Creek  |
|                                   | very early in the morning (3:00   |
|                                   | am). The bus arrival/departure    |
|                                   | time is considered unreasonable   |
|                                   | for a 15 year old student.        |
|                                   | Therefore Motor Vehicle Allowance |
|                                   | (MVA) may be payable as an        |
|                                   | alternate mode of transport for   |
|                                   | the parent to drive between Halls |
|                                   | Creek and Kununurra to connect    |
|                                   | with the commercial flight when   |
|                                   | the arrival/departure time of the |
|                                   | bus is unreasonable. Use of MVA   |
|                                   | in this circumstance is           |
|                                   | considered an appropriate mode of |
|                                   | transport which is reasonable,    |
|                                   | practical and cost-effective for  |
|                                   | Michael’s circumstances.          |
