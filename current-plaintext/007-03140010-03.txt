From 2 July 2018:
- Child Care Subsidy (CCS) replaced Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child
Care Rebate (CCR)
- Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) replaced Special Child Care
Benefit (SCCB) Child at Risk and Temporary Financial Hardship, Jobs,
Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance (JETCCFA) and
Grandparent Child Care Benefit (GCCB)
For more information, see Child Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child
Care Subsidy (ACCS).
Claims for CCB and CCR lump sum for approved care and CCB Registered
Care, for care received prior to 2 July 2018, can be lodged up until 30
June 2019.

This page contains information on the cancellation and rejections codes
for Child Care Benefit (CCB) and JET Child Care fee assistance
(JETCCFA).

In the tables below, rejection or cancellation codes are either:

-   Manual - the code can be recorded manually on the Benefit Action
    (BA) screen, or
-   Auto - system generated codes that cannot be keyed manually

Note:

-   If a lump sum claim is not effective OAT (Outside Allowable Time),
    an automatic letter will be generated. An automatic letter will not
    display until a day after the activity has been finalised. If for
    some reason an automatic letter is not produced, a manual advice
    (Q999) must be issued.
-   If a claim is being manually rejected/cancelled OTH (Other), an
    automatic letter will not be produced, so a manual advice (Q999)
    must be issued.
