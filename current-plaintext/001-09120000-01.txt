This process is impacted by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) response. See
Altered processes and mutual obligation requirements for job seekers due
to coronavirus (COVID-19) response.

This document explains circumstances for which mutual obligation
requirements exemptions can be granted.

Mutual obligation requirements

Job seekers must meet mutual obligation requirements to get income
support payments, unless they are exempt.

Different exemption rules and coding may apply for job seekers in
receipt of Special Benefit (SpB).

From 5 May 2023, ParentsNext participants no longer have participation
requirements, however, an exemption may still be applied if they are
unable to participate in the program due to their circumstances. There
are some exemptions that only apply to ParentsNext participants:

-   Temporary period of confinement
-   Special family circumstances (for short term caring exemption)
-   Bereavement

For more information on exemptions specific to ParentsNext participants,
see ParentsNext exits and exemptions.

Exemption reasons

Reasons to exempt job seekers or ParentsNext participants:

includes medium or long-term serious illness. Do not exempt if drug or
alcohol misuse or dependence is the whole or main cause

    Employment Service (TWES) programme)
-   major disruption to their home

    relative child under a Family Court order, job seekers with mutual
    obligation requirements whose livelihood is drought affected)

Death of a Partner

Claiming DSP â€“ applies to a job seeker who has submitted a claim for
Disability Support Pension (DSP), and:

-   has also claimed JobSeeker Payment (JSP) or Youth Allowance (YA)
    provisional, or
-   is receiving JSP or YA

Mutual obligation requirements for customers after the death of their partner

When a job seeker contacts after the death of their partner, they are
eligible for a Bereavement mutual obligation exemption. Partner death
details are to be recorded on the Miscellaneous Details (NMIS) screen.
The Bereavement Period - Partner exemption (BPP) is recorded from the
date of death of the partner for 14 weeks. If the bereaved is pregnant
at the time of the partner's death, they will have a Bereavement
Period - Pregnant Partner (BPE) exemption for 14 weeks from the date of
the partner's death or to the end of the pregnancy, whichever is later
once verification of pregnancy is provided.

Note: different exemption periods apply on the death of a partner for
ParentsNext participants. See ParentsNext exits and exemptions.

If this is the initial contact after the death of a partner, see Initial
contact after someone has died for more information about available
services and referrals.

Customers may be eligible for Partner Bereavement Payment (PBV) if their
partner dies. PBV can be assessed as either part of a new claim or when
an existing recipient contacts. For more information, see Partner
Bereavement Payment (PBV).

Claiming DSP mutual obligations exemption

A job seeker who claims JSP or Youth Allowance (YA) - Provisional is
exempt from mutual obligation requirements pending determination of
their submitted claim for Disability Support Pension (DSP).

The Claiming DSP exemption is not automatically recorded by the system
when a job seeker submits their DSP claim.

Job seekers who have submitted a claim for JSP or YA provisional, and
those already in receipt of JSP or YA who have submitted a DSP claim
should be immediately granted a Claiming DSP exemption. See JobSeeker
Payment (JSP) and Youth Allowance (YA) (Provisional) for further
information.

Non-Applied Exemptions

Do not exempt customers if drug or alcohol misuse or dependence is the
whole or main cause of their issues. Record a Non-Applied Exemption
decision. See Resources for a list of Non-Applied Exemption types and
codes.

Drug or alcohol misuse often relates to Temporary Incapacity and Serious
Illness (medical certificate) exemptions. Do not apply a Major Personal
Crisis exemption if drug or alcohol misuse or dependence caused the
crisis.

Job seekers remain connected to their provider and need to meet their
mutual obligation requirements. Providers negotiate requirements for job
seekers to overcome their barriers to work and record them in the Job
Plan. Drug or alcohol treatment programs may meet mutual obligation
requirements. Tell job seekers of the benefits of staying linked to
their provider. Do not suggest lodging a medical certificate with:

-   different medical conditions, or
-   excluding drug or alcohol misuse or dependence

Drug or alcohol misuse or dependence Non-Applied Exemptions do not apply
to Community Development Program (CDP) job seekers.

Dad and Partner Pay (DAP) job seekers

Job seekers getting DAP and income support payment with mutual
obligation requirements can ask for a Special Circumstances (SCI)
exemption. The exemption can be for up to 2 weeks while caring for a
child who has entered their care.

Referring job seekers to Workforce Australia

Referring job seekers to providers as a Fully Eligible Participant (FEP)
and volunteer in employment services is possible for:

expectant customers

job seekers:

-   with a Community Service Order or under an Extended Supervision
    Order (ESO)
-   with caring responsibilities
-   having a major personal crisis or disruption at home

principal carers who:

-   have a large family
-   provide home schooling or distance education
-   are foster parents
-   care for children when the job seeker is a relative (not a parent).
    This would be by a Family Court Parenting Order

Use discretion in deciding if a provider referral is suitable while 1 of
these exemptions is current. If a referral is suitable, explain the
voluntary nature and benefits of the referral.

Voluntary attendance at a provider interview

Job seeker registration stays current during a mutual obligation
requirements exemption. Going to a provider interview is voluntary when
exempt.

Providers may not be able to process items on the job seeker's Services
Australia record during the exemption. Lifting the exemption allows
providers to action items. If job seekers do not attend, the exemption
coding is a reasonable excuse for not attending.

For voluntary participation with the provider during the exemption, job
seekers must give their contact details to the provider. If they do not,
the provider cannot help them, as the contact details will not be on
their system.

Community Development Program (CDP)

Refer job seekers to CDP for voluntary assistance if they live in a
designated remote area.

Job seekers who fit into more than one group

Job seekers with mutual obligation requirements can fit into more than
one of the following groups:

-   mature age 55+ job seekers
-   job seekers with a partial capacity to work (PCW), or
-   principal carers

If they do, apply the group that suits the job seeker the most,
depending on their circumstances.

For example, job seekers getting JobSeeker Payment (JSP) who are mature
age 55+, would have full-time mutual obligation requirements. However,
if the job seeker has full-time care of a child aged 14, they fit into
the mature age 55+ and principal carer groups, but would most suit as a
principal carer.

Restricted Access job seekers

Job seekers with Restricted Access recorded can be exempt from mutual
obligation requirements. They can get a Special Circumstances (SCI)
exemption. The SCI exemption end date and the next Restricted Access
review date should align if possible. If the dates cannot align, the SCI
exemption end date should be no more than 12 months. Tell the job seeker
that Restricted Access limits their access to employment services and
about the impact of the exemption.

Restricted Access limits Employment Services Provider access to job
seeker records and the chance to offer all services. Job seekers who
choose to stay with their provider must give the provider their contact
details. If they do not, the provider cannot help them, as their contact
details will not be on their system.

Note: Restricted Access customers are not selected for ParentsNext.
