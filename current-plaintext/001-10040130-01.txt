This document outlines information on how to use evidence to establish
the facts which are relevant to a compliance investigation.

For Participation Solutions Team (PST) - skilled Service Officers (PFDEC
or WNPPD) or service centre Service Officers (UNPP) only.

Evidence-based decisions

The aim of a job seeker compliance investigation is to determine if a
financial penalty or the application of a failure should occur. These
decisions must be evidenced-based decisions.

An evidence-based decision is the process of making the best decision
possible, using all evidence relevant to the reported non-compliance
event.

All job seeker compliance investigations include evidence from both the
person who reported or generated the compliance action, and the job
seeker. Additional evidence is required to reach a decision where the
available evidence is unclear or inconsistent. To support a job seeker
compliance decision, evidence obtained must be:

-   clear and/or consistent, and
-   enough to support a decision about what is most likely to have
    occurred

Responsibility for gathering and assessing evidence

Staff are responsible for:

-   identifying key facts relevant to the compliance action
-   giving the job seeker the opportunity to respond to compliance
    action under investigation, and asking if they have any information
    or evidence they would like considered
-   contacting the provider or relevant third parties where evidence
    from the job seeker differs from the reported compliance action
-   consulting with a PST-skilled Service Support Officer (SSO), social
    worker, or other specialist officer, to clarify the impact of a job
    seeker's circumstance on their ability to comply, as supporting
    evidence to inform the decision
-   reaching a conclusion about what occurred, or, where conflicting
    evidence exists, what is more likely to have occurred

The Resources page contains information on types of evidence and common
scenarios of how to assess evidence.
