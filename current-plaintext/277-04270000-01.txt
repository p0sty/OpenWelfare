This document outlines the process where a payer has:

-   failed to pay the initial payment due after registration (Initial
    Payment Defaulter - IPD), or
-   defaulted on a payment after a period of compliance (First Time
    Defaulter - FTD)

Payment defaulter

When a customer defaults on a payment, undertaking timely action is
essential to recovering the payment in the shortest possible time.

Payers may first receive an SMS to remind them that their monthly
payment was not received on time. The message explains:

-   the date the payment was due
-   to pay now to avoid action being taken
-   to go to myGov and make a payment using their online account

When the amount remains unpaid, the account is reviewed and the payer is
contacted to make the payment immediately. If this cannot be agreed,
staff consider the individual’s circumstances and use the debt repayment
methodology to negotiate payment.

When a payment outcome cannot be achieved, Service Australia pursue
collection through an employer or third party.

The Registrar:

-   is required to collect registered maintenance liabilities by EW from
    the payer's wage or salary, if practical. Some contractors are also
    subject to these provisions
-   can accept a payer's election to make payments directly if they are
    satisfied the payer will pay on time

EW can occur without customer contact if:

-   a customer has had an election for EW not to apply accepted, and
-   they subsequently default on a payment

Consider the customer’s previous payment history and if special
circumstances apply, before establishing EW without customer contact.
