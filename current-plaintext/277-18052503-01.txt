care records.

Change in care - Alignment of Legislation between Child Support and Centrelink

From 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA ex-nuptial cases), customers who
have both a Child Support and Centrelink assessment and/or record:

-   are mutual customers, and
-   can notify either agency of a change to the care of a Family Tax
    Benefit (FTB) eligible/dependent child

The agency notified first will:

-   record the change in care details
-   conduct investigations
-   make a care decision
-   give effect to the decision

Throughout this process, information is shared between Child Support and
Centrelink electronically via data exchange. The final decision is
applied electronically to the customer’s Child Support and FTB/income
support payment assessments. The same rules are used to determine care
percentages.

Note: for care changes before 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA
ex-nuptial cases), staff can search using page history for earlier
versions of this document. Seek assistance from technical support.

Amendments to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

The Child Support Assessment Act (the Act) was introduced on 1 October
1989, and been amended on occasions since then.

From 23 May 2018, amendments were made to:

extend the interim period that applies for recently-established
court-ordered care arrangements, and

provide incentives for the person with increased care to take reasonable
action to participate in family dispute resolution where a care dispute
relates to:

-   an older court order
-   a parenting plan, or
-   a written agreement

From 1 July 2018, the Act was amended further, including changes to
‘care date of effect’ rules.

Both of the above amendments apply for WA ex-nuptial case customers
where care changes are notified on or after 15 May 2019.

For changes in care notified from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA
ex-nuptial case children) see Notification of change in child support
care from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA ex-nuptial cases). Use this
document for changes notified before the changes taking effect or where
WA ex-nuptial ‘Child Support Periods’ are present.

System Enhancements for WA ex-nuptial cases

On 15 May 2019, WA parliament passed legislation that adopted all
Commonwealth child support laws not previously adopted. The parliament
also:

-   referred legislative powers in respect of the maintenance of
    ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth, and
-   repealed the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA)

This means that all changes to care notified on or after 15 May 2019 are
managed under the same rules.

Services Australia enhanced the Child Support system on 18 June 2022 to
automatically treat WA ex-nuptial customers correctly prospectively
where:

-   Child Support Periods (CSPs) are automatically raised on or after 18
    June 2022
-   New cases are registered or cases are restarted with a Start Date of
    Liability (SDOL) on or after 18 June 2022

As this enhancement was prospective only, workarounds are needed for
change of care notifications:

-   on or after 15 May 2019, and
-   ‘date of events’ are within Child Support Periods (CSPs) that
    reflect a WA ex-nuptial status of ‘Yes’ and:
-   care is notified outside of 28 days - late notified care change
-   disputed care - possible interim period - is notified
-   an amended tax assessment is lodged
-   a payee is entitled to child support under an agreement and the care
    they have of the child in the agreement falls below 35%

Service Officers should follow instructions within relevant Operational
Blueprint documents and macros for decision-making and customer
management where these circumstances are present. Once initial decisions
are made, affected records are identified via reporting and specialised
teams action to make sure legislatively correct implementation.

This Cuba Process Help outlines:

-   Processes to follow for care changes notified before 1 July 2018 (15
    May 2019 for WA ex-nuptials)
-   Manual processes needed to update WA ex-nuptial ‘Child Support
    Period’ (CSP) status for CSPs starting on or after 15 May2019 to
    enable Cuba to apply the correct legislation
-   Steps required to correctly apply legislation for changes notified
    on or after 15 May 2019 impacting CSPs that commenced before 15 May
    2019 with a WA ex-nuptial status of ‘Yes’

Note: changes to Child Support Periods (CSPs) reflecting a WA ex-nuptial
status of ‘Yes’ are managed by Service Recovery teams and processes. The
system automatically refers them once initial Service Officer decisions
are processed. When needing to advise customers, refer to the relevant
Operational Blueprint.
