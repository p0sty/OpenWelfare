|                                   | confirmed Jenny’s level of care   |
|                                   | increased but disagreed with the  |
|                                   | date of event, advising the care  |
|                                   | did not change until 10 June      |

|                                   | was discussed. Letters were       |
|                                   | issued to both customers asking   |

|                                   | June 2022. During this            |

|                                   | was discussed.                    |

|                                   | evidence provided by Jenny for    |
|                                   | date of event 6 May 2022. The     |

|                                   | Maddison decreased as a result of |
|                                   | the decision.                     |

|                                   | be made to accept the change in   |
