This document outlines the processes to help practices with self service
options for the PIP eHealth Incentive through Health Professional Online
Services (HPOS).

Aims of the Incentive

The PIP eHealth Incentive encourages practices to:

-   Keep up to date with digital health
-   Adopt new digital health technology, and
-   Improve administration processes and patient care

A practice must meet the 5 eligibility requirements in the eHealth
Incentive guidelines to get eHealth Incentive payments.

Apply for the eHealth Incentive

A practice must use Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) to apply
for the eHealth Incentive.

When there are system issues, the practice can contact the Incentives
Processing team to:

-   Help the caller access HPOS, and
-   Help the caller apply for the eHealth Incentive, see Table 2 Steps
    3-4 on the Process page

If system issues continue, ask the practice to submit a written request
using the:

-   PIP eHealth Incentive application (IP002) form

Escalate all written requests for the IP002 form to the Local Peer
Support (LPS) via the Incentives Escalation Database. Programme
Management will give the IP002 form to the practice. The Incentives
Processing team will process the form once submitted.

The IP002 form is only available in exceptional circumstances when the
practice is having system issues.
