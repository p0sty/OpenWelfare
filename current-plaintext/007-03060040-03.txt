|                                   | Next:                             |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | This equals an increase in YTD    |
|                                   | absences of 2.                    |

|                                   |     i.e. 3, and subtract the      |
|                                   |     increase of the YTD absences  |
|                                   |     (result from Step 4) i.e. 3 - |
