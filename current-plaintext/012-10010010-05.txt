| 1                                 | Do accreditation eligibility      |
|                                   | requirements change if a practice |
|                                   | applies for the WIP – Practice    |
|                                   | Stream and opts to become PIP     |
|                                   | consenting?                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a practice participating in    |
|                                   | WIP – Practice Stream elects to   |
|                                   | become PIP consenting, they must  |
|                                   | obtain accreditation as a general |
|                                   | practice within 12 months of the  |
|                                   | date they joined the PIP, not the |
|                                   | WIP – Practice Stream, unless the |
|                                   | WIP – Practice Stream approval    |
|                                   | date is earlier.                  |

| 2                                 | What if a practice re-applies for |
|                                   | the PIP and/or WIP – Practice     |
|                                   | Stream after closure/withdrawal?  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a practice reapplies after it  |
|                                   | has closed or been withdrawn from |
|                                   | PIP and/or WIP – Practice Stream, |
|                                   | the practice must already be      |
|                                   | accredited to be eligible.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is because the practice has  |
|                                   | already participated in the       |
|                                   | program previously. The practice  |
|                                   | cannot revert to a registered for |
|                                   | accreditation status.             |

|                                   | A practice may already be         |
|                                   | accredited when applying for PIP  |
|                                   | and/or WIP – Practice Stream.     |

|                                   | program(s). The practice must     |
|                                   | still achieve accreditation       |
|                                   | within 12 months of its           |

Payment holds and releases

The Program management payments team monitors expired accreditation
details.

Payment holds are automatically applied to practices in PIP and/or WIP –
Practice Stream with expired accreditation details at the point in time
date, and the three quarter rule will apply.

If an accreditation certificate is submitted by a practice whose
payments are on hold for expired accreditation:

-   Service Officers do not need to remove the payment holds or request
    any subsequent payment releases
-   Program management payments team check if accreditation details have
    been updated throughout each quarter
-   Program management arrange for any holds to be removed and payments
    to be released if needed

When a practice submits an accreditation certificate with a new practice
address and payments are on hold due to practice relocation, Service
Officers can remove the payment hold and request the release of any held
payment(s).
